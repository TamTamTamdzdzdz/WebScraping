The report, released on April 10, comes as the European Union (EU) prepares to implement MiCA, the world\u2019s first extensive regulatory framework for crypto assets. ESMA\u2019s research indicates that about 90% of cryptocurrency transactions are processed by just 10 exchanges, with Binance, the largest among them, commanding half of the market. While such concentration may improve efficiency, it also raises concerns about the consequences of a significant exchange failure or malfunction. ESMA said the concentration is a concern because a single asset or exchange failure could broadly impact the crypto ecosystem. The authority said in its report: \u201cThe top 10 exchanges execute around 90% of total trading volume and, with a volume of over USD 3.7 trillion or a market share of 49%, Binance is the largest exchange. The runner-up, Upbit, recorded only about a seventh of this volume.\u201d However, over time, this concentration has grown. In 2019, it stood at 54%, and as per ESMA\u2019s latest data, it has surged to 73%. Related: Upcoming DeFi rules in Europe could ban non-decentralized protocols The report also highlights that the euro has a limited presence in cryptocurrency trading despite the announcement of the MiCA regulation. However, as it is intended to enhance investor protection, it could constitute a potential growth driver once implemented in 2024. ESMA explained: \u201cThe distribution of involved fiat money reflects a high reliance on the U.S. dollar and the South Korean won as the market\u2019s on- and off-ramp. The euro only plays a minor role and the announcement of the MiCA regulation has not caused an increase in euro transactions so far.\u201d Additionally, ESMA refutes the idea that cryptocurrencies act as safe havens during times of market stress, citing their correlation with equities and lack of stability relative to gold. MiCA, first proposed in September 2020 and approved by the European Parliament in April 2023, aims to usher in a new era of crypto asset regulation, underscoring the industry\u2019s growing significance in the financial sector. MiCA applies to any crypto assets, including securities and e-money, not currently covered by EU traditional finance regulations. As the EU rolls out its comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets\u2013 MiCA, ESMA\u2019s findings underscore the importance of oversight and risk management in this rapidly evolving sector.

Bitcoin mining difficulty has experienced another adjustment before the upcoming Bitcoin halving, hitting a new all-time high of 86.4 trillion, according to data from BTC.com. The latest adjustment, which occurred on April 10, increased the Bitcoin mining difficulty by 3.4% from the previous difficulty level of 83 trillion, which was set on March 28. The latest Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment is likely the last one happening before the halving. According to BTC.com, the next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment will occur in 13 days, or around April 24. In the meantime, the Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in eight days, or on April 19, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin mining difficulty measures how hard and time-consuming it is to mine a new block or solve mathematical puzzles under Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. BTC mining difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, as Bitcoin is programmed to self-adjust the difficulty level to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes. The mining difficulty directly depends on the Bitcoin blockchain hash rate, a unit measuring miners\u2019 computational power to produce new BTC. In line with the increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty, the BTC hash rate has seen a significant increase recently, surging from around 619 exahashes per second (EH/s) on March 28 to 696 EH/s on April 10, according to BTC.com. Unlike the difficulty, which saw an all-time on April 10, the Bitcoin hash rate posted an all-time high earlier. Related: Bitcoin miners may \u2018fear\u2019 the halving, but they cherish it too According to data from BitInfoCharts, the Bitcoin hash rate reached an all-time high of 727.9 EH/s on March 24. Some analysts predict that the BTC hash rate will likely drop after the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024. According to Galaxy\u2019s mining analysts, as much as 20% of Bitcoin\u2019s current hash rate could go offline after the Bitcoin halving, as many miners will likely turn off their mining rigs due to lowered efficiency post-halving. The analysts said that more than 70% of the Bitcoin hash rate was churned out by eight ASIC miner models by the end of 2023.

Speaking with Cointelegraph Editor-at-Large Kristina Lucrezia Corn√®r at the Paris Blockchain Week on April 10, Assia discussed eToro\u2019s journey through several price crash events, recollecting \u201ccrypto winter\u201d episodes of the Mt. Gox crash, the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the recent ecosystem collapses. In the process, Assia underscored the need for investors to learn about assets of interest and stick to a \u201clong-term vision\u201d amid market turmoil. Unlike 15 years ago, investors now have the option to go beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and put their money into various altcoin projects and blockchains. Moreover, Assia envisions a future where real-world assets will be traded over blockchains, much like digital asset securities. In doing so, traditional stock markets could go beyond the current T+1 settlement cycles to how crypto operates. Over the next 10 years, Assia predicts that the market capitalization of crypto projects will exceed $100 trillion in value as most physical assets shift over to the blockchain. He further anticipates that Bitcoin\u2019s market price will continue to rise as more people realize the rising inflation of fiat money and use BTC as a hedge to retain their purchasing power. Responding to Corn√®r\u2019s question on the redistribution of wealth via crypto, Assia said artificial intelligence (AI) will be one of the biggest disruptors, as it is well-positioned to create new types of jobs and generate wealth \u201cthrough creating new forms of money.\u201d Related: Ethereum-based investment products see negative outflows for 4th consecutive week The use of decentralized AIs in the future could be to make investments in an unstoppable blockchain like Bitcoin, and in the process, \u201cthe crypto community will be the first to identify singularity because it\u2019s very hard to define what consciousness is,\u201d he said. In a previous interaction with Cointelegraph, Assia said Bitcoin adoption would be catalyzed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ease of investing through various platforms for non-professionals.

At a regulatory panel discussion at the Paris Blockchain Week, White admitted that crypto regulations are not perfect, adding that he is looking for ways to improve them. One of the plans under consideration is lessening the financial burdens for smaller crypto businesses. White said: \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect. There\u2019s a number of things I\u2019m looking at, at the moment, to try and make the regime fit for everybody. One of those is figuring out a way to deal with the costs of compliance for smaller entities.\u201d The VARA official said getting regulated is a \u201ccostly exercise\u201d and that many people lack the resources. White said this was something the watchdog had experienced, leading them to look for solutions. White explained a potential fix, where larger participants could \u201chost\u201d smaller ones. With this structure, costs would be carried by entities with more resources. He explained: \u201cThe cost of compliance is borne by the larger systemic players, and this allows the smaller players to come into the ecosystem, be regulated, but also not have to suffer the same sort of level of costs of compliance that we\u2019ve got.\u201d The VARA CEO also said that looking at things like this is part of the regulator\u2019s journey of allowing innovation while creating regulations.

Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph at Paris Blockchain Week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said the retail sector has primarily been responsible for inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the United States. Van Eck said that the initial success of the ETFs, which have on some days seen billions of dollars of inflows since their launch, surpassed his expectations. However, he believes the inflows have not come from significant investments from traditional finance (TradFi) players. \u201cI was surprised, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s traditional investors yet. I still think 90% of the flows are retail. You\u2019ve had some Bitcoin whales and some other institutions move some assets in, but they were already exposed to Bitcoin,\u201d van Eck said. Related: $250K Bitcoin? Tim Draper says halving, Bitcoin ETFs will drive demand The CEO of the investment management firm added that no U.S. banks have officially approved or allowed their financial advisers to recommend Bitcoin to date. Van Eck said that the next month could see the arrival of some major institutional investments from banks and traditional firms but that the Bitcoin ETF landscape was still in its infancy: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of maturation to happen. A lot of technology will be developed on-chain, so there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Cointelegraph also asked why investors would prefer to invest in a Bitcoin ETF over directly buying and managing BTC themselves. Van Eck said convenience was a major reason, as investors look to fund managers to handle their entire portfolios. \u201cConvenience, safety and affordability. You had 2% spreads on many centralized exchange platforms like Coinbase. We have single-digit spreads for the ETFs and no fees or low fees. It\u2019s easier just to do a buy ticket than anything else,\u201d Van Eck said. VanEck was founded in 1955 by John van Eck, who would make his name by starting the first gold fund in the United States in 1968 when gold was fixed against the dollar. Van Eck said his father\u2019s fund boomed as inflation soared in the 1970s. Van Eck said that his tendency to be a \u201cparanoid business person\u201d has kept him alert to any emerging assets that could contend with gold: \u201cIn 2017, we said Bitcoin will not replace gold, but it will significantly complement it in people's portfolios.\u201d Van Eck said his firm\u2019s \u201cbig picture\u201d approach to investing is driven by the understanding that political, economic and technological trends will drive financial markets. Up until the 2010s, there had not been an emerging asset until Bitcoin rose to prominence. Related: \u2018Unsustainable\u2019 deficit, inflation means more demand for Bitcoin: Grayscale \u201cI started looking at Bitcoin. I\u2019m not like super in love with it or anything. I just think that, at times, you really want to have a store of value in your portfolio. And that\u2019s what I care about, people\u2019s investment savings,\u201d Van Eck explained. The CEO added that there\u2019s an argument for Bitcoin being a better store of value than gold in contemporary times. He also said that the U.S. has \u201cbig budget deficit problems\u201d that it must tackle in the coming year and that market movements are reflecting anticipation of this reality. While much has been made of the impact of Bitcoin ETFs and the price appreciation of the preeminent cryptocurrency in 2024, Van Eck said their impact might be overstated: \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to point out is that it\u2019s not the most earth-shattering thing. The Bitcoin market is more global and much deeper than just being influenced by the ETFs.\u201d Van Eck pointed to a sharp rise in price in early April that did not occur during U.S. trading hours, which is indicative of the influence of Asian markets.

This marks a significant milestone in the company\u2019s financial recovery and creditor reimbursement efforts. In an April 9 filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Voyager disclosed that the majority of the reclaimed funds, roughly $450 million, stem from a settlement with FTX. Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022 as the crypto market suffered several shocks, including the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May. In October 2023, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed parallel lawsuits against former Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich for fraudulent statements. This settlement, including interest, accounts for about 25% of Voyager creditors\u2019 aggregate claims and is anticipated to be disbursed shortly. In addition to the FTX agreement, Voyager has obtained a claim of approximately $675 million from its ongoing litigation with Three Arrows Capital. Of this amount, $20.43 million represents Voyager\u2019s proportionate share of the initial distribution from 3AC. The administrator expects additional payments to be disbursed in the coming years as assets are sold off and further litigation settlements are secured. A settlement reached through D&O insurance mediation will also allocate at least $14.35 million to benefit Voyager\u2019s creditors.

Around 270,000 checks totaling $17 million remain uncashed, with the majority valued at less than $25. Voyager has set a deadline of April 20, after which these uncashed checks will be voided if not claimed. Voyager is also still dealing with the repercussions of an FTX data breach. An ongoing investigation is being conducted to identify the origin and consequences of the breach, which resulted in the compromise of creditor data. As of May 2023, a restructuring plan proposed having Voyager customers recover 35.7% of their claims in cryptocurrency or cash. The crypto exchange settled with the FTC for $1.65 billion in monetary relief in November 2023.

Ordinals are the first iteration of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first blockchain network. Ordinals live solely on the Bitcoin blockchain, unlike most of today\u2019s popular NFT collections that host their metadata on centralized servers, creating additional points of vulnerability.

Speaking to Cointelegraph during Paris Blockchain Week, Draper reiterated his belief that Bitcoin (BTC) would drastically increase in value considering several factors in 2024. \u201cIf I had to predict, maybe we could see $250,000 by the end of the year; I mean, it\u2019s looking pretty good,\u201d Draper said as he reflected on his previous price prediction for 2022. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has been a critical driver of renewed interest and capital inflows into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Draper believes the investment products have opened up a new avenue for Bitcoin-curious investors that might be daunted by the prospect of holding BTC in self-custody and also serve as a hedge against devaluing fiat currencies: \u201cI think that it gives people an opportunity to buy some Bitcoin and hold on to it so that they can take care of themselves when there\u2019s a run on the dollar or the euro.\u201d He also highlighted the appeal for investors who want their respective fund managers to continue managing their portfolios.

At the same time, fiat currencies grapple with inflation and decreased purchasing power. \u201cI don\u2019t really need to hold on to any fiat currency that decreases in value over time because of political whims or government spending, or politicians that just decide they\u2019re going to spend more money and inflate your money,\u201d Draper said. The venture capital investor added that Bitcoin remains a \u201cplace of great security\u201d against inflation. \u201cI think I\u2019ve actually started to see the lines cross. People feel more comfortable with their Bitcoin than they do with their dollars.\u201d The fourth Bitcoin halving is also set to have a significant impact on market dynamics. The event, earmarked for April 20, is one that investors should not underestimate, as Draper explains: \u201cIf you\u2019re an investor in the stock market, they say don\u2019t bet against the Fed [U.S. Federal Reserve]. If you\u2019re a Bitcoin buyer, don\u2019t bet against the halving. It changes everything. The supply shrinks, the demand increases and the price goes up. That\u2019s natural economics \u2014 supply and demand,\u201d Draper said.

A debate will be held in an April 23 public hearing to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of Bitcoin mining in the country, Senator Lilian Samaniego confirmed in an April 10 Senate session. It comes about a week after lawmakers introduced a draft law on April 4 to temporarily ban Bitcoin (BTC) mining for 180 days, claiming illegal cryptocurrency mines have been stealing power and disrupting the country\u2019s electricity supply. However, days later, Paraguayan lawmakers approved a declaration to support local and foreign investment infrastructure four days later on April 8, which Senator Salyn Buzarquis hopes will push the Paraguayan Ministry of Industry to study the economic advantages of selling excess energy to Bitcoin miners instead. In an April 8 letter to Congress, Buzarquis noted that that 45 licensed cryptocurrency miners are on track to generate $48 million for the National Electricity Administration (ANDE) by 2024 \u2014 expected to reach $125 million by 2025 after miners install more equipment. With the cost of electricity production at Paraguay\u2019s Itaipu\u2019s hydropower plant hovering around the $22-per-megawatt-hour (MWh) range, ANDE could generate a 45% net profit margin by selling off excess energy to local Bitcoin miners at $40/MWh. This equates to $73 million annually and about $17 million in value-added tax for the treasury, noted Buzarquis, who claimed that Bitcoin mining operations could even save ANDE from filing for bankruptcy. \u201cThis flow of funds is what is going to save ANDE from going bankrupt; to be able to invest more in infrastructure and not to raise the rate for Paraguyans.\u201d Paraguay currently sells energy to Brazil at a subsidized $10/MWh rate, Buzarquis noted. Cryptocurrency mining could also generate more employment opportunities for the local economy, Buzarquis added in the April 10 senate session. Related: Bitcoin\u2019s halving won\u2019t see a 600% return this year \u2014 so adjust your strategy In the earlier April 4 bill, lawmakers argued that there have been 50 cases of interrupted power supply linked to cryptocurrency miners illegally tapping into these electricity sources since February. If passed, it could impact one of the largest industry players, Marathon Digital Holdings, which expanded into Paraguay last November, deploying 27 MW around the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant. The controversy in Paraguay comes as Bitcoin miners prepare for the upcoming Bitcoin halving event expected to take place on April 20, which will slice miner rewards from 6.25 BTC ($442,000) to 3.125 BTC ($221,000).

Pandl argued that, given the current high inflation, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to reduce interest rates anytime soon. However, upcoming events like Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 20, rising economic growth and more crypto adoption will fuel Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cThe Fed won\u2019t be able to cut rates for a while with core inflation this high, but booming nominal growth, the Bitcoin halving and adoption trends like tokenization should create a supportive environment for crypto markets.\u201d The inflation in March rose 0.4% month-on-month and 3.5% year-over-year, versus 0.3% monthly increase and 3.4% year-over-year estimates from the Dow Jones economists survey show. The outcome has left many disappointed, as commentators resonated with Pandl\u2019s concerns that persistent high inflation rates will hinder the Fed from lowering interest rates in the near future. Ernst & Young chief economist Greg Daco told Yahoo Finance that the higher inflation rates put more pressure on \u201cpolicymakers to sustain a higher-for-longer monetary policy stance.\u201d Pandl, however, also said that while an increase in the real interest rate is a \u201cshort-term negative for crypto,\u201d there will be continued demand for store-of-value assets over the longer term. From a macro perspective, the 10-year real interest rate soared by 19% from the previous month to 1.934, up from February\u2019s 1.616, which might be a catalyst for prompting investors to gravitate toward less volatile assets, such as bonds and term deposits. There have been several instances over the years when the 10-year real interest rate experienced a major monthly spike, and Bitcoin\u2019s price significantly dropped in correlation. The 10-year real interest rate surged by 52.35% from December 2017 to January 2018, rising from 0.573 to 0.873, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell sharply during this period, from approximately $12,839 at the end of December 2017 to $9,240 by the end of January 2018, representing a 28% decline. Related: Bitcoin whales \u2018buy the dip\u2019 post-CPI as BTC price gains 3.6% Following the release of the most recent CPI information, Bitcoin experienced a minor downward shift in its price, mirroring a similar sentiment from investors.

This 19.8% decline over ten days coincided with the U.S. Consumer Price Index inflation announcement, which was slightly higher than expected at 3.5% year-over-year in March. Several factors have adversely affected SOL's price performance, including the network's difficulties in managing increased transaction requests, diminished interest in Solana SPL tokens, along with the rampant use of excessive leverage in derivatives markets. Despite reclaiming the $168 support level on April 10, SOL remains the least performant coin among the top 15 on a weekly scale. To provide context, SOL lagged behind its primary competitors, BNB and Ethereum, by 16% and 14%, respectively, over the past week. This suggests that the bearish momentum for SOL is largely unconnected to trends in the broader cryptocurrency market. There are opinions suggesting that the recent surge and subsequent decline in SOL's price were driven by an unsustainable demand spurred by the memecoin frenzy and recent Solana SPL token airdrops, rather than factors occurring within the last 24 hours. This viewpoint supports the idea that SOL's price correction on April 10 is part of a longer-term downtrend, evidenced by the failed attempt to surpass the $200 mark on March 31. Andre Cronje, the creator of the Fantom network, interprets the congestion on Solana as indicative of increased demand for block space, arguing that recent transaction failures and performance issues should not be viewed as technical shortcomings. Cronje suggests that the network is, in fact, a victim of its own success. Solana Labs has announced a tentative bug fix scheduled for April 15 in response to these issues. On April 9, Solana validators passed a proposal aimed at reducing the latency of consensus votes, a move Solana Labs says could discourage the incentives to delay block finalization by awarding a variable number of credits to the first-acting validators. A software upgrade for Solana, anticipated in the coming weeks, is expected to implement this solution. Whether or not Solana's congestion issues can be viewed as bullish, the significant number of transaction failures has coincided with a downturn in the performance of relevant tokens within its SPL ecosystem. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, Jupiter (JUP) saw a 23% decline month-to-date in April, while Raydium (RAY) and Jito (JTO) experienced decreases of 14.5% and 15.5%, respectively. Likewise, Solana's most prominent memecoins, including Dogwifhat (WIF), faced a 20% drop over ten days. Despite this uptick in activity, Solana's transaction fees have remained modest. This unexpected dynamic prompts questions regarding the network\u2019s long-term viability, especially when considering the relatively high setup and maintenance costs for validators in comparison to other chains. In a comparison of blockchains by weekly transaction volume, Solana emerged as the clear leader, with 39.5 million transactions over the past week\u2014more than double Polygon's 12.9 million. However, in the realm of transaction fees, Solana collected a mere $16.9 million, significantly less than Uniswap's $30 million or Ethereum's $68 million. This indicates that competing projects may offer better returns on fees to their tokenholders compared to Solana. Related: 3 reasons why DOGE, WIF and other memecoins are crashing Furthermore, Solana\u2019s derivatives market is facing the potential threat of cascading liquidations, with futures open interest surging by 32% over the last week. The total value of matched positions between longs and shorts reached SOL 17 million, equivalent to $2.86 billion. This does not necessarily suggest an over-reliance on leverage by bulls, but it does highlight a risk should Solana's price continue to fall. In light of Solana's on-chain data and derivatives market performance, the prospects for a positive surprise in the SOL token price seem limited, at least until the congestion issues are fully addressed.

ASIC previously argued that Finder Wallet\u2019s yield-bearing product operated without an appropriate license or authorization. But Federal Court Justice Brigitte Markovic dismissed the case on March 14, ruling ASIC failed to establish that Finder Wallet\u2019s Earn product constituted a \u201cdebenture\u201d \u2014 a debt security where companies promise to pay back borrowed money with interest \u2014 under the Corporations Act. In the April 10 filing, ASIC argued Justice Markovic \u201cerred\u201d in this finding because there was no depositing of money or a loan to Finder Wallet when an investor used the Finder Earn product. Additionally, \u201cthere was no undertaking by Finder Wallet to repay money as a debt,\u201d the securities regulator argued. \u201cASIC has appealed this decision because it is concerned that the Finder Earn product was offered without the appropriate license or authorization and therefore without the benefit of important consumer protections,\u201d ASIC argued in a separate statement on April 10. The appeal will be heard by the Full Federal Court on a date to be determined.

The publication said the need for stablecoin regulation is \u201curgent,\u201d but diversity in regulation poses risks for their integration into the international financial system. Most regulatory approaches are similar in their authorization of issuers, reserve requirements, risk management and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, the report noted. Differences in the structuring of stablecoin issuances can cause them to be regulated under banking, securities, commodities or payment system frameworks, however. There are also differences in the details of regulations, redemption policies and the definition of a stablecoin. For example, some jurisdictions regulate algorithmic stablecoins, which are not pegged to external assets, identically to fiat-pegged stablecoins, but the United Kingdom, Japan and Singapore regulate them separately, and jurisdictions in the United Arab Emirates ban them altogether. The report said: \u201cDifferences appear to be largely driven by the variety of stablecoin design features, perceived risks associated with their issuance and the nature of the issuing entity. [\u2026] The resulting fragmentation may pose significant challenges for an integrated financial system.\u201d Reserves may have to be segregated in different ways, placed in the hands of custodians subject to differing requirements or, in the case of the U.K., placed in a statutory trust.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView reveals that the ADA price fell to an intraday low of $0.558 on April 10, down 3% over the last 24 hours. Let us discuss the factors driving ADA price down today. Data from Token Terminal reveals that the drop in ADA price coincides with a modest drop in the token\u2019s trading volume and the number of core developers. Notably, the number of unique GitHub daily users who made more than one commit to the blockchain\u2019s public GitHub repository reduced from a three-month high of 146 developers on March 6 to 122 on April 10, representing a 16.5% decline. Transaction volume was reduced by 80.7% from approximately $2.189 billion to $421 million over the same period. Additional data from DefiLlama suggests that total value locked (TVL) on the Cardano network plummeted from $473.33 million on March 16 to $371.51 million on April 10. The decline in trading volume, active core developers, and TVL coincides with ADA\u2019s 27% price drop over the same period, hinting that these metrics have influenced ADA\u2019s short-term price trends\u2014and April 10 is no different. From the technical point of view, the ongoing correction in the price of ADA is part of a corrective cycle that started in mid-March after the token hit a two-year high of $0.81. Traders booked profits as ADA\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart became overbought after crossing 70. An RSI reading above 70 means the asset is becoming overvalued and may undergo trend reversal or corrective pullback. ADA is pursuing an extended downtrend, confirmed by its downward movement inside a descending parallel channel. The RSI is positioned at 48, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the downside. Related: Retail interest in crypto \u2018quite low\u2019 compared to last bull run \u2014 LunarCrush CEO The recent retracement in ADA price showed signs of further weakness after rejection from the descending channel\u2019s upper boundary at $0.61\u2014 confirming a stiff barrier around this level. If the bulls fail to flip this level to support, then ADA\u2019s likelihood of continuing its prevailing downtrend will be much higher. This negative outlook is corroborated by on-chain data from IntoTheBlock. Its In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model showed that the channel\u2019s upper boundary at $0.61 sat just above the $0.58 to $0.60 price range, where approximately 2.17 billion ADA were previously bought by roughly 132,970 addresses. This resistance was robust enough to absorb any buying pressure attempting to push the ADA price higher. ADA bulls must flip this zone into support to avoid further losses.

With the promise from tech leaders that AI will do everything and be everything for us, AI assistants have become our business and marriage consultants, our advisors, therapists, companions, confidants \u2014 listening as we share our business or personal information and other private secrets and thoughts. The providers of these AI-powered services are aware of the sensitivity of these discussions and assure us that they are taking active measures to protect our information from being exposed. Are we really being protected? Research published in March by researchers at the University of Ber-Gurion showed that our secrets can be exposed. The researchers devised an attack that deciphers AI assistant responses with surprising accuracy, despite their encryption. The technique exploits a vulnerability in the system design of all major platforms, including Microsoft\u2019s Copilot and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4, except for Google\u2019s Gemini. Related: Trading Bitcoin\u2019s halving: 3 traders share their thoughts Furthermore, the researchers showed that once the attacker built a tool to decipher a conversation \u2014 for example, with ChatGPT \u2014 this tool could work on other services as well, and thus could be shared (like other hacking tools) and used across the board with no additional effort. This is not the first research pointing to security flaws in the design and development of AI assistants. Other studies have been floating around for quite a while. In late 2023, researchers from several U.S. universities and Google DeepMind described how they could get ChatGPT to spew out memorized portions of its training data merely by prompting it to repeat certain words. The researchers were able to extract from ChatGPT verbatim paragraphs from books and poems, URLs, unique user identifier, Bitcoin (BTC) addresses, programming codes and more. Adversaries could intentionally use crafted prompts or inputs to delude the bots to generate the training data, which may include sensitive personal and professional information. The security problems are even more acute with open-source models. A recent study showed how an attacker could compromise Hugging Face conversion service and hijack any model that submitted through the conversion service. The implications of such an attack are significant. The adversary could implant their own model instead, push malicious models to repositories or access private repositories datasets. To put things in perspective, the researchers found that organizations such as Microsoft and Google \u2014 which combined have 905 models hosted on Hugging Face \u2014 that received changes through the conversion service, and might have been at risk of an attack and compromised. AI\u2019s new capabilities may be alluring, but the more power one gives to AI assistants, the more vulnerable one is to an attack. Bill Gates, writing in a blog last year, described how an overarching AI assistant (what he termed an \u201cagent\u201d) will have access to all our devices \u2014 personal and professional \u2014 to integrate and analyze the combined information to act as our \u201cpersonal assistant.\u201d As Gates wrote in the blog: An agent will be able to help you with all your activities if you want it to. With permission to follow your online interactions and real-world locations, it will develop a powerful understanding of the people, places, and activities you engage in. It will get your personal and work relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You\u2019ll choose how and when it steps in to help with something or ask you to make a decision. This is not science fiction, and it could happen sooner than we think. Project 01, an open-source ecosystem for AI devices, recently launched an AI assistant called 01 Light. \"The 01 Light is a portable voice interface that controls your home computer,\" the company wrote on X. \"It can see your screen, use your apps, and learn new skills.\u201d It might be quite exciting to have such a personal AI assistant. However, if the security issues are not promptly addressed, and developers are meticulously making sure that the system and code are \u201cclean\u201d from all possible vulnerabilities, there is a possibility that if this agent is adversely attacked, your entire life could be hijacked \u2014 including information of any person or organization that is related to you. In late March, the U.S. House of Representatives set a strict ban on congressional staffers' use of Microsoft's Copilot. \"The Microsoft Copilot application has been deemed by the Office of Cybersecurity to be a risk to users due to the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services,\" House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine Szpindor said in a statement announcing the move. In early April, the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) \u2014 which falls under the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 published a report blaming Microsoft for a \"cascade of security failures\" that enabled Chinese threat actors to access U.S. government officials\u2019 emails in summer 2023. The incident was preventable and should never have happened. Related: Bad blockchain forensics convict the user of a Bitcoin mixer \u2014 as its operator As the report stated: \"Microsoft has an inadequate security culture and requires an overhaul.\" This would most likely include security issues with Copilot. This is not the first ban on an AI assistant. Technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Samsung and Spotify along with financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs and others have banned the use of AI bots for their employees. Major technology companies including OpenAI and Microsoft pledged last year to adhere to responsible AI. Since then, no substantial actions have been taken. Pledging is not enough. Regulators and policy makers should demand actions. In the meantime, we should refrain from sharing any sensitive personal or business information. And maybe if we \u2014 collectively\u2014 stop using these bots until substantial actions have been taken to protect us, we might have a chance to be \"heard\" and force companies and developers to implement the needed security measures.

Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a Wells notice to Uniswap and LunarCrush CEO says retail investors have yet to get excited by the impending crypto bull run. Paraguayan senators have halted progress on the proposed cryptocurrency mining ban introduced last week, with officials now considering the benefits of selling excess energy from its Itaipu hydropower plant to miners instead of exporting it to Brazil and Argentina. A debate will be held in an April 23 public hearing to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of Bitcoin mining in the country, Senator Lilian Samaniego confirmed in an April 10 senate session. It comes about a week after lawmakers introduced a draft law on April 4 to at least temporarily ban Bitcoin mining for 180 days, claiming illegal cryptocurrency mines have been stealing power and disrupting the country\u2019s electricity supply. However, days later, Paraguayan lawmakers approved a declaration to support local and foreign investment infrastructure four days later on April 8 \u2014 which Senator Salyn Buzarquis hopes will push the Paraguayan Ministry of Industry to study the economic advantages of selling excess energy to Bitcoin miners instead. Decentralized exchange Uniswap has been issued a Wells notice by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Uniswap Labs\u2019 chief legal officer, Marvin Ammori, confirmed the regulatory notice on April 10. In an X thread, Ammori said the notice was \u201cdisappointing, but [...] not unexpected from this SEC.\u201d \u201cIf the SEC had authority over our self-custodial, non-intermediated products, it could tell us how to register them. It can\u2019t and so it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt has provided no clarity and no guidance \u2013 as several SEC commissioners have stated in multiple dissents.\u201d As Cointelegraph previously reported, the SEC has been investigating Uniswap Labs \u2014 the DEX\u2019s main developer \u2014 since 2021. The decentralized exchange previously delisted several tokens due to regulatory pressure. Uniswap Labs isn\u2019t the first crypto firm to receive a Wells notice. The SEC issued similar notices against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. While Bitcoin and other digital asset prices are increasing, retail investors are not yet \u201cbelieving the hype,\u201d according to Joe Vezzani, the CEO of social media analysis platform LunarCrush. Vezzani said that compared to the last major bull run, social interactions and overall retail interest are \u201cstill quite low.\u201d In the last six months, posts mentioning Bitcoin (BTC) showed bursts of activity in January and March. Vezzani said that if spam and bots are factored out from the interactions, the crypto space could experience a decline in social media activity. He explained: \u201cIn terms of the number of creators and influencers posting daily, we have witnessed growth. However, the notable change we are not observing is in the level of engagement with those creators.\u201d Even with upcoming major events like the Bitcoin halving, the executive does not believe there would be a substantial shift in retail engagement. Vezzani argued that the halving \u201cis typically perceived as more of an insider event.\u201d \u201cBitcoin is already challenging for newcomers to grasp, and when we introduce concepts like halving, we risk alienating the public and diminishing their interest in that discourse,\u201d he added.

Some analysts expect the upcoming Bitcoin halving to act as a major trigger, but new research by crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant said that the halving effect \u201chas been diminishing, as the new issuance of Bitcoin gets smaller relative to the amount of Bitcoin selling from long-term holders.\u201d Another negative voice in the near term is that of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who believes there will be extreme weakness in risky assets until May 1. However, Hayes is positive for the medium term as he expects the Bitcoin halving to push prices higher. If one rides the short-term volatility, the subsequent rally could cheer the investors in the long term. Bitfinex analysts said in a research report shared with Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could soar 160% post halving to reach between $150,000 and $169,000 in the next 14 months. Will Bitcoin bulls assert their supremacy and push the price higher, or will the bears make a comeback? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin broke above the symmetrical triangle on April 8, but the bears yanked the price back into the triangle on April 9. This shows that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they are trying to buy the dip to the 20-day exponential moving average ($68,497). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair will make another attempt to rise above the $73,777 overhead resistance. If that happens, the pair could rally to $80,000 and then to $84,000. Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, the bears will sense an opportunity and pull the pair down to the uptrend line. A break and close below the triangle will suggest the start of a corrective phase toward $60,000 and eventually to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. Ether (ETH) turned down sharply from the overhead resistance of $3,679 on April 9, indicating that the bears are not willing to relent. The bulls are trying to stall the decline at the 20-day EMA ($3,479). If the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will have another go at the $3,679 level. If this resistance gets taken out, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to the overhead resistance of $4,100. Contrary to this assumption, if the price slips below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action between $3,056 and $3,679 may extend for a few more days. The trend will favor the bears on a break below $3,056. BNB (BNB) turned lower from the downtrend line on April 8, but the bulls did not allow the price to sink back below the 20-day EMA ($574). This shows buying on every minor dip. The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers maintain the price above the triangle, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to $692 and thereafter attempt a rally to the pattern target of $795. The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the downtrend line and sink the price to the uptrend line. A break below this support will signal the start of a correction toward $460. The bulls are struggling to push Solana (SOL) above the 20-day EMA ($178), signaling that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. The bears will try to sink the SOL/USDT pair below the 50-day SMA ($159), but the bulls are likely to vigorously protect the level. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $162 and $205 for a while longer. Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA, the pair will complete a double-top pattern. The pair could collapse to the next strong support at $126. Buyers tried to extend XRP\u2019s (XRP) recovery above the moving averages on April 9, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling on rallies. The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. That could keep the XRP/USDT pair range-bound between $0.56 and $0.69 over the next few days. The advantage will tilt in favor of the buyers if the price rises above $0.69. That could clear the path for a possible rally to the formidable level of $0.74. On the downside, a drop below $0.56 could sink the pair to $0.48. Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) relief rally met with heavy selling pressure from the bears near $0.21 on April 8. The bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.19) on April 10, suggesting demand at lower levels. Buyers will make another attempt to drive the DOGE/USDT pair above $0.21. If they manage to do that, the pair may climb to $0.23. A break and close above this level will signal the resumption of the uptrend toward $0.30. If bears want to prevent the upward move, they will have to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then descend to the 50-day SMA ($0.16). Toncoin (TON) has been trading inside an ascending channel pattern for the past few days. The price picked up momentum after breaking above $5.69 on April 8. The bears are trying to stall the up move at the resistance line. If the price turns down sharply from the current level, the TON/USDT pair could drop to the channel\u2019s support line. The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the support line because a break below it may start a deeper correction. A break and close above the channel will signal the start of a vertical rally. The pair may surge to $8.56 and then to $10. Related: Here\u2019s what happened in crypto today Cardano\u2019s (ADA) recovery hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($0.61) on April 9, signaling that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The price dipped to the strong support at $0.57, an important level to watch out for in the near term. If the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the ADA/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $0.57 and $0.68 for a few more days. On the other hand, a break below $0.57 will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, which could start a downward move toward the critical support of $0.46. Avalanche (AVAX) turned lower from the downtrend line on April 9, suggesting that the bears continue to sell on relief rallies. The AVAX/USDT pair is stuck between the downtrend line and $42. If the bulls propel the price above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could then attempt a rally to $60. This view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below $42. That will indicate the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair may plummet to $35, which is likely to act as a formidable support. The bulls tried to push Shiba Inu (SHIB) above the downtrend line, but the bears held their ground. However, a minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to dip below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000023. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.000028) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between buyers and sellers. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the downtrend line. That could open the doors for a rise to $0.000033 and subsequently to $0.000039. Contrarily, a drop below $0.000023 will signal that bears are trying to take charge. The SHIB/USDT pair may slump to $0.000017. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The incentives, issued in the form of \u201cEthena sats,\u201d can be converted to its native ENA token at the end of each campaign. To earn sats, users must first deposit Ethena USDe stablecoins into their exchange wallets, connect to the Ethena decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, and stake their holdings. The protocol has a total value locked of $2.274 billion at the time of publication, generating an annualized revenue of $178 million. The protocol\u2019s ecosystem rewards have attracted considerable attention and usage. As told by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, since the start of Ethena Staking Season 2, the 10 top wallets have withdrawn a total of 37.5 million ENA ($51 million) and staked them. On March 8, less than one month after launching its USDe stablecoin, Ethena became the highest-earning decentralized application in crypto when it offered a 67% annual percentage yield (APY) on USDe. The protocol currently has an APY of 24% on its stablecoins. However, the yield is not without risks, as it relies on trading income of complex Ethereum derivatives to pay out promised returns. Amid concerns over its high yield, Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, told Cointelegraph in an interview on Feb. 22 that comparisons to the failed Terra stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), were just \u201cknee-jerk reactions\u201d and that the firm\u2019s yields were organic and sustainable. \u201cThe biggest piece we\u2019re trying to get across is that Anchor\u2019s yield was just totally made up,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt was just venture capital firms putting money into [USTC yield protocol] Anchor and then paying out a yield, which came from nowhere.\u201d Meanwhile, Ethena\u2019s yields, which are publicly verifiable, are derived from a combination of Ethereum consensus layer inflation rewards, execution fees paid to Ether (ETH) stakers, maximal extractable value fee captures acquired by Ether stakers, and trading income provided by Ethena Labs. Specifically, the firm opens short derivative positions when it receives long-position collateral assets for minting USDe. The spread, or difference in value between the two positions, is then paid out to USDe holders as yield.

According to a signal vote completed on April 10, more than 62% of voters supported the exchange\u2019s proposal to transition to a so-called \u201cLabs model.\u201d SushiSwap introduced the proposal on March 26, leading to significant debate within its community. According to the plan, the exchange seeks to establish Sushi Labs, an autonomous administrative, technical and operational company that would manage the Sushi ecosystem. Tokenholders would still decide on treasury allocations, but without getting into operational details. The Labs would receive 25 million SUSHI (SUSHI) tokens, worth nearly $39 million at current prices. In addition, Sushi Labs will be designated as the exclusive recipient of any future airdrops from affiliated protocols and partners. \u201cWe request that Sushi DAO award a grant of 25 million Sushi tokens to Sushi Labs, including assets from the Arbitrum airdrop, business development, and partner grants, Kanpai 2.0, Sushi 2.0, rewards, stablecoins, and \u2018Sushi House\u2019 funds.\u201d The next steps for Sushi\u2019s community include voting on the implementation proposal by April 17. Nearly 7 million tokens support it, representing a 92% approval rate at the time of writing. A signal vote is an initial step to gauge the community\u2019s interest or opinion on a proposal without implementing any changes. An implementation vote, on the other hand, is a subsequent step where the community decides if the proposal should be executed. On Sushi\u2019s governance forum, several community members expressed their opposition to the proposed plan, voicing concerns regarding the treasury\u2019s financial stability and allegations of voting power manipulation. \u201cI think it would be important to have a sizable amount of all revenues, airdrops included, going directly the the DAO treasury. This would not interfere with hiring, firing, or other operations [...] Treasury should not be ignored. [...] I suggest a split of revenues between treasury and operations,\u201d noted community member Nick Rishwain in the proposal\u2019s thread. Another member of the SushiSwap community, Na√Øm Boubziz, claimed on X that the move was a hostile takeover. According to Boubziz, the core development team created new wallets prior to the vote in order to increase their voting power. \u201cIt appears that Sushi DAO is at the end of its journey,\u201d said another member on the governance forum. Sushi \u201chead chef\u201d Jared Grey has responded to the criticism. \u201cAfter consulting our legal counsel, I directed the operations team to execute the YAY vote with the OPs wallet and its holdings due to the threat of a hostile takeover,\u201d he said on X in response to allegations of manipulation. Grey also noted that the Labs model will help Sushi recover lost market share: \u201cMuch of the current product development roadmap\u2019s limitations and delays stem from the DAO\u2019s outsized ambition, unrealistic expectations, and budget constraints endorsed through snapshot votes from when Sushi\u2019s resources were multitudes greater.\u201d SushiSwap\u2019s revenue has been declining since 2022 despite the current bull market. According to DefiLlama data, the decentralized exchange generated $11.65 million in fees and $1.5 million in revenue in March 2023, compared to $3.5 million in fees and $531,640 in revenue last month.

Its previous funding round, completed in May 2023, was led by Celesta Capital and Mayfield. This Series B round was overbooked, according to a press release, and nearly equaled its Series A funding of $81 million. According to Auradine, the company also reached a milestone of $200 million in bookings. It\u2019s unclear exactly what valuation the funds were raised at. Rajiv Khemani, co-founder and CEO of Auradine, said in a statement that the funds would be used to increase production further: \u201cWe are very proud of the advancements that our team has made in bringing innovative, energy-efficient, and secure products to our customers. The strong orders and pipeline reflect the confidence our customers have in us. With this new funding, we will ramp up production capacity and accelerate investments in our product roadmaps.\u201d Auradine\u2019s products and services reportedly run the gamut from web infrastructure support for privacy, security, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications all the way to its \u201cTeraflux\u201d line of Bitcoin (BTC) miners purported to be the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest and most energy efficient.\u201d Per company literature, Auradine\u2019s AI3680 model miners are \u201ccapable of achieving an output of 0 to 375 TH/s, with an optimal efficiency of 15 J/TH.\u201d For reference, Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S21 Hydro, among the fastest miners currently in production, is rated at 335 TH/s.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the BTC price dropped as much as 2.5% from the April 10 opening at $69,115 to an intra-day low of $67,463 on Coinbase. Bitcoin\u2019s price reacted to the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which exceeded expectations. The inflation in March rose 0.4% month-on-month and 3.5% year-over-year, versus 0.3% monthly increase and 3.4% year-over-year estimates from the Dow Jones economists survey. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.4% from February while rising 3.8% from a year ago, compared to estimates of 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively. In March, CPI increased at an annual rate of 3.2% for all items. \u201cThe index for shelter rose in March, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed over half of the monthly increase in the index for all items. The energy index rose 1.1 percent over the month. The food index rose 0.1 percent in March. The food at home index was unchanged, while the food away from home index rose 0.3 percent over the month,\u201d read an official press release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Market participants immediately began debating the possibility of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in the coming months, shifting their timing from June to later in the year. According to the CME's FedWatch tool, traders are placing the odds of a June rate cut at just 20.6% at the time of writing versus 45.9% for September. This means market analysts are betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold rates steady in May and June, with the first possible cut being made in September. \u201cInterest rate futures are now pricing in just 2 interest rate cuts for the entire 2024,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a reaction on X. \u201cOdds of a rate cut in June are down from ~60% before the CPI report to ~22% now.\u201d Kobeissi Letter added that this is the first time in history that markets are \u201cpricing in less rate cuts\u201d than the guidance given by the FED. Meanwhile, the tapering off of inflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is dampening the short-term outlook of Bitcoin investors. April 9 outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) totaled around $154.9 million, according to data compiled by BitMEX Research. Overall, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $18.7 million, marking the second consecutive day of negative inflows. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT, had the highest inflow totaling $128.7 million. Bitwise\u2019s ETF, BITB, and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, FBTC, came in second and third with over $3.8 million and 3 million in inflows, respectively. There was no capital inflow into the rest of the ETFs on April 10. Slowing spot Bitcoin ETF inflows indicate a decrease in investors\u2019 interest in the investment products as caution kicks in. Nevertheless, the market remains optimistic about the BTC\u2019s upside potential after the Bitcoin halving event, which is less than ten days away. Vijay Pravin Maharajan, founder and CEO of bitsCrunch, acknowledges the importance of the upcoming miner reward halving event, saying that it could \u201cnot only propel BTC to new all-time highs but also positively impact various other assets.\u201d \u201cConsequently, investors might anticipate a reinitiation of the bull market in the latter half of Q2.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It is unclear why his sentencing was postponed from the original date of May 1. Salame was one of the four members of the FTX top management to be charged by the United States government along with Sam Bankman-Fried in relation to the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s collapse. Salame was the only one of the four \u2014 who also included former Alameda Research head Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gray Wang and former FTX top engineer Nishad Singh \u2014 who did not testify against Bankman-Fried. All of the four executives reportedly made plea deals with U.S. prosecutors. Salame is free on a $1-million bond. Like the other executives, Salame has pleaded guilty to federal charges relating to the FTX debacle. In addition, he faces charges on campaign finance violations connected with his girlfriend Michelle Bond\u2019s unsuccessful bid to represent New York\u2019s First District in the House of Representatives. Bond was defeatedin the Republican primary. Both of the charges against Salame could reportedly result in sentences of up to five years in prison. Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers argued that he should not face campaign contribution violation charges because they were not part of his agreement on extradition from the Bahamas. Those charges were later folded into the conspiracy to commit fraud charges against him. Related: Is SBF secretly behind BALD?

All four executives charged with Bankman-Fried have pleaded guilty to the charges against them. Salame\u2019s role in the criminal activities at FTX remains somewhat ambiguous. He was reportedly not part of Bankman-Fried\u2019s inner circle and was so shocked by the news of the exchange\u2019s collapse that he became physically sick. However, Bahamian court records later showed that he informed the country\u2019s Securities Commission of irregularities at the exchange in November 2022, leading to an investigation.

Prima facie, the decline across the top joke cryptocurrencies is part of a pre-halving dump across the crypto market. Top digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), have recently pulled back from their yearly highs as traders secure profits ahead of the Bitcoin Halving 2024, prompting similar strategies in the memecoin sector. That is akin to how memecoins reacted ahead of Bitcoin's previous halving in May 2020, with DOGE's price dropping by over 22.5%. There exists a strong positive correlation between Bitcoin and top memecoins. For instance, BTC's daily correlation coefficient versus DOGE was 0.82, showcasing strong possibilities of DOGE's price trends mirroring BTC's in the coming days. Steno Research projects that Bitcoin may experience a pattern similar to its 2016 halving. It anticipates a continuation of selling pressure for up to four months following the halving. This \"sell-the-news\" mood is further depreciating memecoin sector valuations. The memecoin sector's correction accompanies strong declines its weekly trading volumes, according to data resource Dune Analytics. Notably, the memecoin transaction flows across all blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, have dropped collectively by 88% from its recent top of roughly $1 billion. This suggests that traders' interest or confidence in the sector has waned lately. The decline in trading volumes across the memecoin sector has accelerated further amid reports of Solana outage. Notably, roughly 75% of all transactions on the network failed during March and early April sessions, primarily involving activity brought by the recent memecoin mania. Related: Solana devs target April 15 for failed TX fix \u2014 It\u2019s \u2018not a design flaw\u2019 Solana has become the primary blockchain for retail users and memecoin traders, with trading volumes on its decentralized exchanges rising by more than 300% in Q1 2024 compared to the previous quarter, noted Peter Horten, a researcher at data analytics platform Messari. But in recent weeks, Solana's DEX volume trend has shifted downward, as shown below. This lower DEX activity has preceded a decline in most of the top Solana-based memecoins. Increasing bets on the delay in interest cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2014in the wake of robust U.S. labor data and persistent inflation\u2014have also boosted selling sentiment in the crypto market, particularly affecting memecoins, which are among the most profitable assets worldwide so far in 2024. According to CME data, interest rate futures traders' expectations have significantly shifted. Approximately 81% now wager that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady at 500-525 basis points in June compared to around 60% earlier in April. Assets that yield, such as U.S. Treasuries, become more appealing compared to non-yielding counterparts like cryptocurrencies during higher interest rate periods. Consequently, this shift diminishes the appeal of riskier investments, including memecoins. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The wellness industry generated $950 million in revenue, with 56 million active users in 2023. While the global health and wellness market is projected to rocket to $111.49 billion by 2030, the current landscape remains congested. It often falls short in sustaining user engagement and safeguarding data privacy. The blockchain-based Web3 ecosystem presents a promising solution with its capabilities for fostering sustainable engagement and ensuring robust data protection. Yet, the integration of Web3 within the wellness app sector remains largely unexplored, highlighting a critical absence of a bridge to this space. Merging wellness with Web3 technologies, WELL3 \u2014 a social wellness platform \u2014 integrates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to enhance and support a person\u2019s wellness journey. The platform aims to foster a holistic environment dedicated to well-being, driven by personalized, data-empowered paths to health.  WELL3 aims to increase the wellness of its users while rewarding them. Source: WELL3 Central to the WELL3 mobile app are three key functionalities designed to engage users and promote wellness through innovative means. The first of these features is AI Companion feature. The personalized AI assistant utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to tailor and adapt to individual wellness journeys. By analyzing user data and interactions, the AI Companion provides customized wellness recommendations, encouragement and insights that evolve alongside the user\u2019s preferences and lifestyle.  The mobile app comes with an AI companion that tracks user activity. Next comes the Mindfulness/Wellness to Earn, which incentivizes users to engage in health-promoting activities. The app tracks metrics like steps taken and heart rate through integrations with Apple Health and Google Fit, rewarding users with WELL, the platform\u2019s native token. Aimed at advancing users\u2019 mindfulness, WELL3 employs a system of tasks and missions, rewarding users with experience points (EXP) for completed missions. Users receive EXP rewards within 24 hours of completing each mission, contributing to their progression toward higher levels of mindfulness. The platform categorizes missions into two types: Basic Missions and Special Missions. Basic Missions are daily tasks that easily integrate into users\u2019 routines, promoting consistent practice and offering fresh opportunities for growth and rewards each day. Special Missions, on the other hand, are limited-time challenges that appear periodically. Lastly, the WELL3 wellness ecosystem uses blockchain to enable users to manage who has access to their health data, making them aware of any access or changes. This establishes an ecosystem where users can enjoy data privacy while enriching their wellness journey. WELL3 kicked off 2024 with $5 million fundraising through seed rounds and NFT sales. The company has also recently announced the results of its public sale, which enjoyed a $10 million raise in its first minute while generating over $55 million in ETH in 24 hours. #WELL3 Public Sale Result is out Check your result: https://t.co/avim8iidKi We would like to extend our gratitude and appreciation to everyone who participated in the public sale and contributed to the remarkable achievement üëá WE: üèÜAre the first and fastest to raise 10\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qz0RhnbZZn \u2014 WELL3 (@well3official) April 3, 2024 A token generation event (TGE) planned for Q2 will also see the launch of the minimum viable product (MVP) of the WELL3 App. This phase will also feature promotional collaborations and presence at Token 2049 Dubai.  The third quarter plans of WELL3 include conducting the alpha launch and cultivating partnerships within the fitness and wellness sectors while introducing WELL3-branded merchandise to strengthen its market presence. WELL3 will culminate the final quarter of 2024 with the expansion of its partnership network and the introduction of its AI Companion feature. WELL3 envisions a future where millions, united by the common goal of pursuing health, leverage the latest technological advancements to encourage active lifestyles and secure personal data ownership.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Technology, #Adoption, #AI, #Games, #Blockchain Game, #Web3, #Gaming, #Play-to-earn"},{"date":"Apr 10, 2024","summary":"","author":"Arijit Sarkar","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/queensland-australia-crypto-seizure-law-reforms","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Queensland law enforcement agency calls for more powers to seize crypto","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC), a law enforcement agency in Queensland, Australia, has identified certain gaps in state laws that encourage criminal use of digital assets. To overcome these legal shortcomings, the agency has proposed modernizing Queensland\u2019s asset confiscation regime. The CCC questioned the efficacy of Queensland\u2019s Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002 (CPCA) when it comes to confiscating cryptocurrencies tied to organized crimes, such as money laundering. The commission has called for a significant reform of the Act that seeks to achieve seven priority outcomes, three of which directly relate to the effective seizure of digital assets. It said: \u201cDigital assets are expected to continue to proliferate as the criminal environment increasingly becomes less physical, and the CPCA less effective for dealing with digital assets.\u201d The lack of crypto-related language in the CPCA, such as cryptocurrency, crypto asset or digital asset, is the root cause of the gaps within Queensland\u2019s legislative regime, according to the CCC. Citing the importance of CPCA to remain fit for purpose within a changing criminal environment, the commission added: \u201cWhile digital assets can be restrained and forfeited under the CPCA, there are currently no specific provisions for investigative agencies in Queensland to facilitate effective seizure of digital assets.\u201d The CCC sees this inability to seize digital assets as hindering Queensland\u2019s ability to gather evidence, attribute ownership of a digital asset, or facilitate the storage or transfers of digital assets, among others. The commission recommended reforms such as defining \u201cdigital assets\u201d and introducing them to money laundering laws, converting seized assets into stable currencies amid legal proceedings and automatic forfeitures.

Prosecutors charged him with money laundering and fraud, which led to losses of 340 million New Taiwan dollars ($10.6 million). The Taipei City police previously arrested Pan and 14 others allegedly involved in the case in January 2024 following raids on several locations, including Ace\u2019s headquarters. The prosecution found that Pan was one of the persons affiliated with the fraudulent cryptocurrency wallet service referred to as \u201cAlfred\u201d or \u201cAfu wallet\u201d and a related crypto card. According to prosecutors, the persons defrauded customers by offering a service based on a classic high-reward promise model through offline over-the-counter exchange and fake investment groups.

A Taiwanese court reportedly ruled that the defendant\u2019s property should be seized, with some confiscated assets amounting to at least 3.5 million NT$, or $110,000.

The January mentions may be due to the hype surrounding the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

There was also a surge of posts in March as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. However, the number of posts remained steady despite the Bitcoin rally to $73,737 on March 14. Social mentions of the keywords Ethereum or ETH remained somewhat steady in the last six months. However, the data shows that these keywords have seen a downward trend since the beginning of March. Meanwhile, Solana\u2019s (SOL) token shows several bursts in the last six months, likely driven by the memecoin frenzy on the network. Despite this, social media posts mentioning Solana or SOL declined at the beginning of April.

The issue, which has left AMPL depositors unable to withdraw their assets from Aave, has persisted since December 2023. Other DeFi pools on Aave are not affected by the problem. AMPL is a stablecoin designed to track the 2019 value of the U.S. dollar adjusted for inflation. The protocol increases or decreases the number of tokens available based on whether its price matches its dollar target. In November 2022, Aave became the victim of an alleged market manipulation attack against its Curve (CRV) pool. The attack failed to net any profits for the attacker, but it led to $1.6 million of bad debt for the protocol. In response, AaveDAO voted on Nov. 2, 2022 to freeze deposits and borrows for 17 different tokens, including AMPL. The freezing did not prevent old depositors from withdrawing at that time, only blocking new deposits and borrows. However, in a December 2023 post on the AaveDAO forums, Bored Ghost Developing Labs (BGD Labs), a development team contributing to the Aave protocol, claimed to have discovered an additional problem preventing withdrawals. According to it, a bug in the pool contract had allowed it to be drained of funds, which meant there was no longer enough liquidity to process withdrawals. In response to the issue, an Ampleforth representative suggested that AaveDAO should purchase AMPL tokens and distribute them to users as compensation, but Aave developers have countered with their own proposal to pay out stablecoins instead of AMPL. Aave developers have also asked the Ampleforth team to provide 40% of the compensation package from its own funds. At the time of publication, the Ampleforth team has not confirmed whether it will provide these funds, but it has stated it will continue to offer support to help resolve the problem. On March 31, BGD Labs proposed paying depositors $300,000 worth of USD Coin (USDC). It claimed this was merely an initial distribution and that the remaining amount could potentially be paid out after further debate. Despite not completely resolving the debate, the proposal passed on April 5, with over 99.9% of votes in favor. Related: Aave purchases 2.7M CRV to clear bad debt following failed Eisenberg attack According to Aave\u2019s GitHub documents, when tokenholders deposit funds into the lending pool, they should receive an equivalent amount of \u201caTokens\u201d in exchange. These aTokens essentially function as deposit receipts. As the pool receives interest payments, depositors should receive additional aTokens representing their share of these interest payments. However, BGD Labs claimed that the AMPL pool contract is not working as intended: It has a flaw that is causing it to pay out more AMPL aTokens (aAMPL) than the amount of underlying AMPL available. As a result, there is not enough AMPL in the pool to allow depositors to withdraw. BGD Labs stated: \u201cThe aToken supply of the asset appeared to be way more than it should, bigger than the sum of the variable debt plus available liquidity. [...] The aAMPL supply is currently not representative of the claims over AMPL underlying. [...] As the utilisation is 100%, no withdrawals can be executed, only repayments and liquidations.\u201d BGD Labs claimed that Ampleforth developers designed and wrote the contract, not AaveDAO contractors. It claimed to have reached out to the Ampleforth team and asked it to determine how much AMPL was owed to each depositor. BGD Labs asked depositors to be patient while the Ampleforth team attempted to come up with a solution to the problem. On Jan. 31, Ampleforth developer Ahmed Naguib Aly, known simply as \u201cNaguib\u201d on the Aave governance forum, said the team was aware of the problem and working to solve it. \u201cWe have been coordinating with [AaveDAO risk managers] Chaos labs and Gauntlet to get to an effective resolution,\u201d he wrote. On March 8, Naguib gave a detailed assessment of the problem and proposed a solution. According to him, the pool was facing a shortfall because some depositors had withdrawn before the excessive interest payments were detected. As a result, these early withdrawals had drained the pool of funds: \u201cMore interest was credited to depositors than was charged from borrowers. This discrepancy has led to situations where some depositors were able to withdraw more than what should have been possible under normal circumstances. As a direct consequence, we\u2019re now facing a liquidity shortfall, preventing current depositors from withdrawing their funds.\u201d According to Naguib, Ampleforth was unable to determine the proper amount of AMPL that should be paid out to each depositor at that time. However, he expected the team to determine these values by March 22. Naguib noted that the Aave protocol owns some tokens within its \u201cAave collector\u201d contract. Once the correct amounts of AMPL owed to each depositor became known, these tokens could be used to reimburse users, he suggested. An \u201cupper bound\u201d of 715,335 AMPL (approximately $1.3 million at the March 8 price) would be needed to fully compensate users. Naguib proposed that AaveDAO purchase AMPL on the open market using these reserves, which should then be distributed to depositors through a contract to be built in the future. On March 17, Naguib withdrew his proposal, stating BGD Labs had disagreed with it. \u201cBGD labs reached out to us that they don\u2019t find the proposal to swap AMPLs and release it to holders to be an effective method to resolve the situation and they want to propose a different resolution,\u201d he stated. On March 21, BGD Labs and Aave risk management consultant Chaos Labs introduced a joint proposal to compensate depositors. The two teams estimated the shortfall at 533,973 AMPL (approximately $1 million at the March 21 price). According to them, this amount of AMPL represented over 30% of the circulating supply. Buying this much AMPL would \u201cbe inefficient, given its relatively illiquid status and effectively altering the underlying economics of the asset.\u201d Instead, they proposed that depositors should be compensated based on the average U.S. dollar value of AMPL over the four-month period that has passed since the Nov. 22 freeze. This would equate to $1.198 per AMPL or $639,700 total, which could be paid out in stablecoins such as USDC. Chaos Labs and BGD Labs also suggested that Ampleforth should provide 40% of the funds to compensate depositors, with AaveDAO footing the bill for the other 60%: \u201cConsidering that the problem is on a contract of Aave, but that the implementation was done by the Ampleforth team, we propose a 60% (Aave) 40% (Ampleforth) split on the total to be deposited on the smart contract for the distribution.\u201d This new proposal was criticized by many of the forum participants. Some critics claimed that it was unfair for depositors to receive stablecoins as compensation. \u201cAspects of the proposed resolution include paying aAMPL holders a below market rate amount of USDC instead of actual AMPL,\u201d user Fiddlekins stated in a post. This is unreasonable, they claimed, because \u201crepaying them [depositors] in USDC just transfers the burden of price impact to them if they wish to then rebuy AMPL with it, and denies them the ability to sell the asset they should have for its current elevated price if they don\u2019t.\u201d Fiddlekins mentioned that AaveDAO sold 283,500 aAMPL of its reserves on Jan. 23, receiving $363,000 in exchange, which the user considered to be inconsistent with the view that AMPL is too high of a price to buy back. \u201cPut bluntly: the DAO seems happy to sell low but not to buy high, and argues that lenders should bear the brunt of that,\u201d they said. Other critics took issue with the idea of a 60%/40% funding split between AaveDAO and Ampleforth. \u201cWhy would Forth DAO pay out it if there are issues on AAVE\u2019s smart contract?\u201d RomanPope asked. In response, QuantumEvolver argued that both sides were to blame. \u201cThe AMPL developers made a mistake in the smart contract from start, and they still cannot determine what exactly the mistake was. And AAVE is also responsible since they should have audited the smart contract before integrating it into the AAVE platform to make sure it would work fine.\u201d Related: Aave deploys DeFi protocol on BNB Chain On March 31, BGD Labs made a new proposal: AaveDAO would pay out $300,000 in stablecoins to depositors, which it would obtain from its reserves held in the Aave collector contract. It said the proposal was necessary because \u201cwe don\u2019t have any type of news from the Ampleforth team.\u201d If Ampleforth wants to contribute to the compensation plan at a later date, \u201cwe expect communication in this forum,\u201d BGD Labs stated, adding that such a contribution \u201ctechnically will be perfectly doable.\u201d The proposal was confirmed by a vote of over 99% on April 5. In its post revealing the proposal, BGD Labs claimed that the amount owed to depositors \u201cwill be more than 300\u2019000 USD,\u201d implying that even after passage, at least one more distribution will be needed to make depositors whole. On April 7, Naguib posted a statement that attempted to explain Ampleforth\u2019s position on the matter. He claimed the team became aware of the incorrect interest payments in May 2022. However, at that time, \u201cthe discrepancy was small, well below the AMPL reserve balance.\u201d Aave was also planning to transition to Aave version 3 at the time, and the two teams agreed that the pool should be frozen until this transition was completed. According to Naguib, they also agreed that AaveDAO should use its AMPL reserves to cover any shortfalls if it becomes insolvent before all depositors withdraw. After this discussion, deposits and borrows were frozen for the AMPL pool on Nov. 22, 2022. But on Nov. 25, deposits were reenabled, leading to a greater shortfall for the pool over time. Then, AaveDAO sold its AMPL reserves on Jan. 23, 2023, which made covering the shortfall much more difficult for AaveDAO. According to Naguib, Ampleforth was initially unaware of both of these events. When the Ampleforth team became aware that the shortfall had grown much larger, it suggested what it saw as a \u201csimple and non-controversial resolution,\u201d which was \u201cto pick a date before the discrepancy started growing exponentially, and assume lenders were holding AMPL since that point.\u201d This calculation would have allowed a compensation package to be produced quickly, and it could have been covered by some combination of AaveDAO reserves and Ampleforth funds. Naguib claimed that this proposal was made privately to the BGD Labs team. BGD Labs reportedly rejected Ampleforth\u2019s suggestion and instead asked it to calculate the amount owed based on off-chain simulations of AAVE platform behavior. This simulation process took longer but eventually led to the Ampleforth team\u2019s March 8 proposal for AaveDAO to buy back AMPL to repay depositors. Naguib stated that the Ampleforth team \u201cwill continue offering the necessary support for investigation and for BGD Labs in reaching a proposal that satisfies the community,\u201d but also argued that BGD Labs should \u201ctake the lead to a resolution,\u201d as the team believes \u201cthey [BGD Labs] are best positioned to perform this work.\u201d","tags":"#Business, #Ethereum, #Lending, #Peer-to-peer lending, #Stablecoin, #DeFi, #Aave"},{"date":"Apr 10, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/hong-kong-regulator-fast-tracks-bitcoin-spot-etfs","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Hong Kong regulator fast-tracks Bitcoin spot ETF approvals","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The Securities Regulatory Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) has reportedly expedited the approval process for four spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

After the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong greenlights the initial set of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will require approximately two weeks to finalize listing procedures and related arrangements. The upcoming endorsement of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong heralds numerous prospects for institutional and individual investors. As retail investors are granted entry to Bitcoin investments via ETF purchases, the investment landscape stands on the brink of a significant shift. Julia Leung, CEO of the SFC, emphasized the need for responsible use of innovative technologies like distributed ledger technology and tokenization to improve efficiency in the financial industry while ensuring investor protection during a keynote speech at the HSBC Global Investment Summit. Additionally, Leung highlighted efforts to align corporate reporting standards with sustainability disclosure standards and promote informed investment decisions aligned with sustainability goals.

The ministry made several recommendations to foster the growth of digital assets in the country. Andrew Bayly, the minister of commerce and consumer affairs of New Zealand, recommended revamping the country\u2019s sluggish approach toward experimenting and adopting innovations on digital assets and blockchain technology. He urged the government to support the development of the crypto industry and consider appropriate policies to manage related risks. In response to the inquiries by the parliamentary Finance and Expenditure Committee into cryptocurrencies, Bayly\u2019s office said: \u201cThe current \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach could risk New Zealand missing out on the benefits of development in the digital asset industry.\u201d The ministry\u2019s advisers made eight key recommendations for New Zealand to get back on the global crypto wave. The recommendations include adopting policies and regulations to encourage developments in digital assets and blockchain, facilitate greater collaboration between government and industry players and immigration to address skills shortages in digital assets and blockchain. Other recommendations also made it to the list of friendlier approaches to crypto, such as developing training and educational resources, tax incentives, Anti-Money Laundering provisions and continuing the design work on an in-house central bank digital currency (CBDC). Bayly noted that most of the recommendations are long-term in nature and highlighted the need for a coordinated global regulatory approach and supervisory frameworks for digital and crypto assets.

It is measured by multiplying the existing Coin Days Destroyed metric by the current price of Bitcoin to compare spending velocity over time. Currently, it stands at 3.03, having briefly surged to 4.21 on March 28. It has doubled since the beginning of this year when the VDD multiple hovered around 2.04 on Jan. 1, as per GlassNode data. The last time the VDD multiple went above 4 was in January 2021, when Bitcoin was $40,257. However, the brief peak before the cooldown didn\u2019t result in a market downturn, as Bitcoin\u2019s price promptly surged. Just two months later, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared by 52.2% to $61,283 in March 2021, as per CoinMarketCap data. It is now just nine days to the Bitcoin halving, and it has surpassed the levels observed before past halving events.

With less than 10 days left before the Bitcoin halving, will the previous all-time high price support level hold? This marks Bitcoin's third failed attempt to jump decisively below its all-time high, reflecting traders' uncertainty near record levels, where profit-taking or increased selling pressure prevents further upward movement. Bitcoin's back-to-back upside rejections increase its potential to undergo sharp price declines in the coming weeks. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, predicts that April's Bitcoin halving, alongside strategies employed by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, will trigger a \"firesale\" of crypto assets. Hayes highlighted that the latter half of April could pose significant risks for volatile assets, a period marked by a decrease in liquidity due to U.S. tax payments, the commencement of quantitative tightening by the Fed, and the pending utilization of the Treasury's General Account (TGA). \"The precarious period for risky assets is April 15th to May 1st,\" he argued, adding: \"This is when tax payments remove liquidity from the system, QT rumbles on at the current elevated pace, and Yellen has yet to start running down the TGA. After May 1st, the pace of QT declines, and Yellen gets busy cashing checks to jack up asset prices.\" A Deutsche Bank survey reveals a divided consumer sentiment on Bitcoin\u2019s future: about one-third anticipate its value dropping below $20,000 by the end of 2024, a stark $50,000 decline from its current price, echoing the lows of a 2022 bear market. Only 10% of the 3,600 participants expect it to exceed $75,000 by December. Meanwhile, 40% are optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects, but nearly an equal proportion (38%) foresee its disappearance. Related: Levels of consumer trust in crypto increasing: Report Crypto market analyst Rekt Capital sees Bitcoin crashing to around $40,000 after the halving, citing its price moves around the previous three halvings. For instance, the chart below illustrates similarities between the price trends around the halving in 2020 and 2024. The circled area, highlighted in blue in the associated chart, is significant because it aligns with the region where Bitcoin has historically experienced roughly 20-40% retracement before its halving events. For instance, in 2024, BTC's price has pulled back by roughly 18%, closer to its circa 20% correction preceding the 2020 halving. That leaves it with more room to decline ahead of the 2024 halving\u2014less than 10 days away. Afterward, Bitcoin may enter the re-accumulation area (red), which would see it consolidating inside the $60,000-70,000 range, followed by a strong breakout toward a new record high, as illustrated by Rekt Capital. \"The Re-Accumulation phase can last multiple weeks and even up to 150 days (i.e 5 months),\" the analyst noted, adding: \"Many investors get shaken-out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.\" On the flip side, the analyst predicts a descent toward Bitcoin's ascending trendline support around $40,000, should the price fall beneath $60,000.

In an April 9 interview with CNBC, Jan van Eck said his firm\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application will \u201cprobably be rejected.\u201d He noted that VanEck was the first to file for a spot Ether ETF in the United States alongside Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, both of which are awaiting a final decision on May 23 and May 24, respectively. \u201cThe way the legal process goes is that regulators will give you comments on your application and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs, but now pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned.\u201d CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti was equally pessimistic, telling CNBC, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything being approved this side of the year.\u201d Van Eck\u2019s comments come following prolonged inaction from the U.S. SEC regarding a roster of seven pending applications for spot Ether ETFs. Several commentators, including Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, have also looked to the ongoing \u201cradio silence\u201d between the regulator and prospective fund issuers as a key reason why a May ETF approval seems increasingly unlikely. VanEck\u2019s Ether ETF application is due for a final decision on May 23 \u2014 the first of seven fund issuers, including Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, awaiting approval. Balchunas lowered his formal odds for an Ether ETF approval by May from 70% to 35%. The analyst reiterated his stance on the pending approvals and echoed Van Eck\u2019s sentiments in an X post on April 9. The analyst reduced his approval odds to 35% in March.

Instead, the \u201ckey driver\u201d affecting the price of Bitcoin (BTC) following the halving this time will be the increase in demand from investors with sizeable holdings of Bitcoin. Demand from whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoin has grown to \u201caround its highest ever,\u201d seeing 11% growth month-on-month, writes CryptoQuant. While the Bitcoin halving reduces supply \u2014 typically putting upward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 there have been a few instances between 2021 and 2023 where the monthly demand from long-term holders has exceeded the supply within the same timeframe. However, the current gap between them is much larger than ever, suggesting that with an ongoing monthly supply deficit, the halving\u2019s effect on Bitcoin price action might not be as powerful as it has been in the past. Long-term holders are now accumulating about seven times more Bitcoin per month than new Bitcoin entering circulation. \u201cPermanent holders are adding as much as 200K Bitcoin per month to their balances, much more than the ~28K Bitcoin issuance. Bitcoin monthly issuance will decrease to ~14K after the halving,\u201d it stated. Furthermore, the total issuance of Bitcoin plummeted to only 4% of the total available supply, a significantly smaller proportion compared to before previous Bitcoin halvings. \u201cIssuance represented 69%, 27%, and 10% of total Bitcoin available supply previous to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd halving,\u201d CryptoQuant wrote. After the 2016 halving, the price of Bitcoin increased by about 4,200% to $19,800, and after the 2020 halving, the price of Bitcoin increased by almost 683% to $69,000. The Bitcoin halving event is when Bitcoin miner rewards are cut in half. The upcoming halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Bitcoin\u2019s price is $68,764, representing a 7.12% increase over the past five days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Related: Bitcoin's halving won't see a 600% return this year \u2014 so adjust your strategy However, other indicators suggest that investors remain optimistic that the upcoming Bitcoin halving \u2014 currently slated for April 20 \u2014 will be a major catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise higher. Open interest (OI) in Bitcoin is currently at $78.36 billion, just 11 days away from the halving, according to CoinGlass data. This is roughly 30 times higher than the OI volume recorded 11 days before the previous halving in May 2020, which stood at $2.61 billion. OI measures the total value of all outstanding or unsettled Bitcoin futures contracts across exchanges. An uptick in value suggests heightened market activity and trader sentiment. Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital suggested to his 447,000 followers on X that any price dip in Bitcoin between now and the halving is likely to bounce back quickly. \u201cDo you realize whatever downside Bitcoin experiences before the halving, if any, will be the very last bargain-buying opportunity in the 2024 pre-halving period ever?\u201d Rekt declared in an April 9 post on X.

It was not a sure bet, and it wasn\u2019t a secretive bet. The bet he made could be seen by anyone,\u201d Talkin said. The Mango Markets exploit occurred out in the open and the public nature of blockchain transactions meant that anyone could have taken the other side of the trade, he added. \u201cIf his counterparties had seen them and opted to, they could have traded against him,\u201d Talkin asserted. \u201cHe executed a successful trade.\u201d In October 2022, Eisenberg inflated the value of the platform\u2019s native token, MNGO, relative to USD Coin (USDC). He then took out a series of loans against the inflated MNGO price, which drained Mango Markets\u2019 treasury of around $110 million worth of various cryptocurrencies.

Despite some of the funds being returned, the team behind Mango Markets sued Eisenberg for $47 million in damages plus interest.

Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, led the decline by falling 4.12% to around $68,941 in the last 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto, has dipped 4.63% to trade at $3,508 in the same period. Let\u2019s explore the reasons why the crypto market is down today. Crypto prices failed to sustain their recent bullish momentum ahead of the April 10 Consumer Price Index (CPI) print that is expected to come in higher than expected. Commenting on the market reaction, CNBC analyst Sara Min said the release of U.S. inflation data scheduled for April 10 could spark a major move in risk assets as traders wait to see how the Federal Reserve will proceed with interest rates. The March CPI reading is expected to see a 0.3% increase month-on-month and a 3.4% rise on a yearly basis, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to climb by 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Popular trader and analyst Daan Crypto Trades drew attention to macroeconomic events set for April 10 and 11, including CPI, PPI, Jobless claims and the ECB interest rate decision. \u201cThe market has not been reacting a lot to these things lately, but I think they are still important to keep an eye on,\u201d the analyst wrote. A hotter CPI could mean a correction, while a cooler print could trigger a move higher, increasing the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in June. The CME FedWatch Tool now sees a 42.3% possibility of keeping the Fed funds rate unchanged in June, while chances of a rate cut are at 56.2%. The decline in the prices of major cryptocurrencies has led to a rush of liquidations across the derivatives market. Bullish traders appear to have been caught off guard, leading to a quick spat of long liquidations. In the past 24 hours, over $242.87 million in long positions have been liquidated across the crypto market, with $152 million wiped out in the previous 12 hours. Asset prices are negatively affected when long derivative positions are liquidated without buying pressure from trading volume. Over 83,164 traders were liquidated, with the largest single liquidation being Ether/USD on OKX, valued at $7.53 million. Related: Bitcoin's halving won't see a 600% return this year \u2014 so adjust your strategy The chart above shows that there are more liquidations on Ether than on Bitcoin. Daan Crypto Trades highlighted this phenomenon in an April 9 post on X, saying, \u201cEvery time ETH shows some kind of strength, the entire market tanks.\u201d The crypto market faces a market cycle different from previous bull runs. This can be attributed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving. On March 27, the net capital flows into all the spot Bitcoin ETFs turned negative at $233.8 million, with Grayscale\u2019s converted GBTC fund recording another day of outflows totaling $303 million, the highest over the last 10 days, according to data provided by Farside Investors. Slowing Bitcoin ETF inflows indicates a decrease in investors\u2019 risk appetite. In uncertain or bearish market conditions, investors might prefer holding cash or investing in more traditional and less volatile assets. However, market participants remain optimistic about the crypto market\u2019s upside potential before and after the Bitcoin halving event, which is less than 10 days away.

And while some may even be secretly hoping for an end to the profitability slashing (which has even bankrupted companies in the past), most miners agree \u2014 it\u2019s what makes Bitcoin special, and it\u2019s not going anywhere. \u201cWe as miners embrace halvings and cherish them \u2014 but of course, we fear them a bit too,\u201d said Kristian Csepcsar, chief of propaganda at the Bitcoin mining infrastructure firm Braiins. There have been concerns that the Bitcoin halving event, set for April 20, could lead to some Bitcoin miners going under \u2014 particularly if the price of Bitcoin fails to exceed the cost of mining. \u201cMiners are true Bitcoiners at heart,\u201d said Csepcsar. \u201cSo even though halvings put extreme pressure on the mining industry as a whole we all understand why halvings are an integral part of the Bitcoin design.\u201d Some Bitcoin mining firms like Hut 8 said they look at the halving as an opportunity to double down on growth and strengthen competitiveness, according to CEO Asher Genoot. \u201cWe have prepared for the halving with a comprehensive restructuring of the business and focus on being a low-cost operator,\u201d Genoot told Cointelegraph. He added that Hut 8 mines \u201conly when it is profitable\u201d using its proprietary software and maintains a strong balance sheet with more than 9,100 BTC that enables it to maintain stability while investing in growth. Hashlabs Mining co-founder Jaran Mellerud believes that Bitcoin miners would probably love the idea of scrapping the halving. However, the Bitcoin network is not controlled by miners, but by node operators, he stressed, adding: \u201cBitcoin was not made for the miners, but for the hodlers.\u201d Like any change to Bitcoin, it is theoretically possible to do away with the halving if you have a hard fork. However, most think it would be \u201cnext to impossible\u201d to reach the consensus required to make the change, while others, such as argues that the resulting product, by design, won\u2019t be Bitcoin anymore. \u201cIt would break one of the key features that every Bitcoiner loves about Bitcoin: it will have less supply inflation than gold, and continue that deflationary trend,\u201d Bitcoin ESG researcher Daniel Batten told Cointelegraph. \u201cOne of the main reasons investors are attracted to Bitcoin is its limited supply of 21 million coins, and this is also what makes Bitcoin unique,\u201d added Hashlabs Mining' Mellerud. He suggested that the Bitcoin market cap would likely be much smaller if there were no halvings and limited supply, and miners would not benefit from the higher block subsidy. Csepcsar from Braiins argues that removing the halving from Bitcoin\u2019s code is virtually impossible. \u201cChange of this magnitude to the core architecture of bitcoin is next to impossible today,\u201d Csepcsar said, adding: \u201cPutting everybody into consensus and changing such a core principle of bitcoin is impossible in any short time frame such as a few years. What will be the case in 10 years and more is another matter and nobody has an answer to that.\u201d Some miners may support the idea of eliminating halvings but full nodes may not, and nodes have significant control over the Bitcoin network, according to New Layer Capital\u2019s general partner Nicholas Safford. \u201cIf a group of miners wanted to implement such a proposal, they would need to hard fork the Bitcoin network, after which point, the new cryptocurrency would cease to be Bitcoin,\u201d he stated. Bitcoin halvings have been historically associated with bullish sentiment as BTC prices surged to new all-time highs after halvings. However, there\u2019s also a fear that the halving would raise the operational costs of mining Bitcoin, hurting profitability. On the halving date, for a miner whose cost of mining 1 BTC was $35,000 per BTC, the cost would suddenly increase overnight to $70,000 per BTC, New Layer Capital\u2019s Safford explained. \u201cThis miner is no longer profitable as the market value of 1 BTC \u2014 currently around $65,000 \u2014 is no longer enough to cover the cost to mine 1 BTC,\u201d he said, adding: Related: Bitcoin needs to hold above $80,000 to keep mining profitable post-halving \u201cHalving inevitably leads to several unsustainably high-cost miners \u2014 due to high electricity rate, less efficient ASICs, high overheads and so on \u2014 dropping off the network.\u201d Industry executives and advocates are confident that halvings are eventually beneficial and are here to stay. \u201cHalvings are the economic catalysts that ensure a smooth curve toward the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap and the need for continuously improving energy efficiency,\u201d Bitfarms\u2019 chief mining officer Ben Gagnon told Cointelegraph. The total global mining activity in USD terms has grown exponentially each halving epoch despite the block reward halving every four years, Gagnon noted. Gagnon also pointed out that there are many coins that don\u2019t have halving events and opted for linear growth of coin supply. \u201cThey have not done well against Bitcoin,\u201d the exec stated. \u201cThe whole point of the Bitcoin Network is that the code is law, and it will not be changed,\u201d said SunnySide Digital founder and CEO Taras Kulyk. \u201cWhat will happen in more than 10 years, really nobody can tell. But I would still not bet on any dramatic changes like changing the 21 million cap or removing halvings altogether,\u201d Csepcsar told Cointelegraph. He added: \u201cBitcoin either has to survive these harsh situations or is not the antifragile freedom tool that we all want it to be.\u201d Magazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Blockchain, #Proof-of-Work, #Bitcoin Mining, #Bitcoin Halving"},{"date":"Apr 09, 2024","summary":"","author":"Isaac Schick","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/biden-mining-tax-2025-budget-proposal","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Biden's mining tax is the least sensible part of his 2025 budget proposal","type":"Blog","category":"Opinion","content":"President Biden in March released his budget proposal for fiscal year 2025. In it, he proposed three changes to the way federal law operates with respect to cryptocurrency. There are some good changes, such as the application of existing securities regulations to crypto. But there is also one bad change \u2014 namely, a special tax on crypto mining. Firstly, the proposal contains two regulatory changes. First is the elimination of a tax loophole that allows cryptocurrency traders to write off losses on assets they sell and then quickly rebuy. Second is the implementation of security loan nonrecognition rules to actively-traded crypto asset loans. The first change simply expands existing rules for stock and bond trading to cryptocurrencies. This is a great example of the government creating an even playing field for similar asset classes without creating new cumbersome and bureaucratic regimes. Related: Bitcoin's halving won't see a 600% return this year \u2014 so adjust your strategy Currently, stocks sold at a loss cannot be re-purchased in less than 30 days. If traders repurchase those stocks, they cannot deduct the loss on their taxes \u2014 a practice known as wash trading. With crypto, the rule is more ambiguous. It isn\u2019t clear under the current regulatory regime when traders can buy their crypto back, but they often do so in much less than 30 days. They realize their losses for tax purposes and then immediately buy those same crypto assets back, functionally realizing a loss without actually losing those assets. The discrepancy between stocks and crypto is a result of slow regulatory application and not because of fundamental differences between crypto and securities. The second modification follows a similar program and applies securities regulations to crypto trading, which operates very similarly. Though this is not to say crypto trading and traditional financial markets are one-for-one, the similarities allow policymakers to carry over regulation from traditional finance to crypto when appropriate. In this instance, when loaning out traditional securities, like pensions and mutual funds, the one making the loan will not be required to recognize losses and gains if they received back essentially the same securities. Extending this rule to digital assets will make many of these loans tax-free, like securities. Both Biden administration proposals are examples of the expansion of regulatory applications without a new agency being created or undue burdens being applied to the budding crypto industry. Unfortunately, Biden\u2019s proposal for a crypto mining tax takes the opposite approach to crypto. Bitcoin (BTC) exists on digital ledgers, which are hosted on a million computers. To update the ledger with new transactions, these millions of computers compete to validate those transactions. This is called mining, and the validating terminal is rewarded with Bitcoin. Related: Bitcoin maximalism is misguided \u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto was a 'Maxi Plus' Mining is essential to any decentralized cryptocurrency since it provides the incentive to host and update the Bitcoin ledger. Without mining, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would need a centralized hub, like fintechs and online banking. The utility of a decentralized method for transferring assets is the removal of a single point of failure or control. Biden\u2019s proposal would impose a 30 percent tax on electricity used in all crypto mining, even if that electricity is off the grid and internally sourced. This would dramatically increase costs for mining in the United States, forcing many miners to operate overseas. Like China\u2019s ban on crypto trading, this will not lead to the end of American crypto usage. Instead, it will simply force innovators in the space to consider operating in countries with friendlier regulatory environments. The plan seems clearly aimed at satisfying the environmental concerns many activists have expressed regarding crypto mining. But it is ill-conceived, making no distinction between electricity sourced privately and sustainably, and electricity leased from nonrenewable sources. The 30 percent threshold is also excessive, massively increasing the cost of crypto mining which could easily be offshored given crypto\u2019s international reach. The Biden administration shouldn\u2019t soil its otherwise positive regulatory changes with a large punitive tax on mining. With the regulatory space in need of some massive, but common-sense, changes, it\u2019s easy for the administration to score a win simply by applying rules used in securities trading to crypto. Some light-touch reforms in this area could be very beneficial in alleviating these issues.

In a hearing on countering illicit finance, terrorism and sanctions evasion, Adeyemo outlined three proposed reforms to improve U.S. enforcement efforts against international bad actors using crypto. Adeyemo was following up on proposals made by the Treasury Department in November. In his latest testimony, Adeyemo listed three changes the department was looking for. Those were to introduce secondary sanctions targeting \u201cforeign digital asset providers\u201d engage illicit finance. U.S. sanctions prohibit institutions from using U.S. correspondent accounts and transaction processing through banks, Adeyemo said, but crypto exchanges and money services do not always depend on the use of correspondent accounts. \u201cA new secondary sanctions tool\u201d is needed: \u201cWe can clarify that our authorities can reach extraterritorially when digital asset entities harm our national security while taking advantage of our financial system.\u201d Adeyemo did not elaborate on the form the new secondary sanctions might take.

Both authors are prominent crypto skeptics. Adeyemo pointed to the use of crypto by terrorist groups, North Korea and in the fentanyl trade as evidence of the Treasury\u2019s need for greater enforcement powers. He conceded that \u201cwe continue to assess that terrorists prefer to use traditional financial products and services,\u201d but cautioned, \u201cwe fear that without Congressional action to provide us with the necessary tools, the use of virtual assets by these actors will only grow.\u201d Banking Committee chair Sherrod Brown released a statement supporting the Treasury Department\u2019s enforcement goals ahead of Adeyemo\u2019s testimony.

This movement led to the liquidation of leveraged long positions amounting to $40 million\u2014a seemingly modest amount, yet sufficient enough to challenge the $69,000 support level. Determining the exact causes of this volatility is challenging, yet three key factors appear to have dampened buyers' enthusiasm: flows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), macroeconomic trends, and a tempered outlook on technology stocks. Despite several unsuccessful attempts to secure a close above $72,000 in the recent fortnight, Bitcoin continues to outshine as one of the top-performing assets in 2024, boasting a 63% increase year-to-date. For perspective, the S&P 500 saw a 9% rise over the same timeframe, and gold, peaking at a historic high of $2,365 on April 9, recorded a 14% increase. This backdrop sets the stage for what can be interpreted as a natural profit-taking phase, often referred to as an \u201caccumulation phase.\u201d The current lack of bullish momentum does not necessarily signify a trend reversal but rather a period of consolidation, as investors seek additional signals before escalating their investments. Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant's founder and CEO, has likened this phase to previous cycles in Bitcoin\u2019s history. The anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin halving has, at times, led to overly optimistic expectations. Despite its historically positive impact on Bitcoin's price, this event has only occurred three times in the past 15 years. For instance, following the May 2020 halving, Bitcoin experienced a 32.7% surge over the subsequent five months, outpacing the gains seen in major stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), which climbed by 58% and 43%, respectively. Recent developments have provided fodder for skeptics and led some investors to reconsider their positions. Notably, the transfer of 6,200 Bitcoin by Grayscale on April 9, valued at over $434 million, has raised eyebrows. With the fund managing 322,697 Bitcoin and levying a 1.5% expense ratio\u2014a rate significantly higher than that of its rivals\u2014the ongoing outflows exert downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, casting uncertainty over future trends. On the macroeconomic scene, investor apprehensions are mounting in anticipation of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March, set for release on April 10. This data is crucial as it may sway the likelihood of the Federal Reserve enacting three interest rate cuts throughout 2024. Market forecasts suggest a 3.4% year-over-year increase in CPI, significantly overshooting the Fed's 2% target and indicating an overheated market. Nonetheless, a faction of investors remains optimistic about inflation's positive impact on Bitcoin, underscoring its benefits derived from a predictable and immutable monetary policy. Related: Japanese investment firm sees stock price soar after adopting Bitcoin The correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks, particularly chip manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD, is noteworthy. This linkage stems either from the utilization of graphics cards in cryptocurrency mining or from some global hedge funds viewing these assets as high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Although Bitcoin\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t always align with stock market trends, the past month revealed a correlation exceeding 80% over a 40-day span. Bitcoin investors are cautious, given that Nvidia\u2019s shares dropped by 6.2% and AMD\u2019s by 7.5% within the first eight days of April. Concerns surrounding Nvidia's earnings have emerged, fueled by potential order reductions from Microsoft and challenges in securing chip supplies from Samsung, as highlighted by Investing.com. AMD's strong foothold in cloud computing further exacerbates the competitive landscape for Nvidia. Bitcoin bears are far from being in control, but at the same time the worsening macroeconomic environment puts in check the odds of BTC price reaching an all-time high ahead of the halving in April.

This increases the chances of a substantial directional price move. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price continues its impressive performance in 2024, with the flagship cryptocurrency hitting new all-time highs in March. BTC spot trading volume has soared since the spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. on Jan. 11, with daily volumes peaking in March. Glassnode noted that the market has \u201ctransitioned into a euphoric phase,\u201d with profit-taking climbing considerably. Data suggests Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum has been building up since October 2023 as the market was pushed into a high liquidity and volatility regime. The crypto analytics firm reported that BTC\u2019s year-to-date performance is supported by \u201cstrong demand\u201d in spot markets, mirroring a similar structure seen during the 2021 bull run. Bitcoin\u2019s flow in and out of exchanges has also increased significantly since July 2023. Glassnode data shows that the monthly average of total inflows and outflows from exchanges is currently at $8.19 billion per day, substantially higher than the 2021 bull market peak. \u201cOverall, Bitcoin\u2019s YTD price action is supported by a significant uptick in spot trade volume and exchange flows on-chain.\u201d Due to high liquidity and the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving, a cloud of euphoria is covering the market, a clear indication that the bull market is on. Bitcoin\u2019s realized profit also increased to 1.8% in March, reclaiming the 2021 peak. This suggests that \u201c1.8% of the market cap was locked in as profit over a 7-day period.\u201d Glassnode expects new capital to flow into Bitcoin since \u201cprofit taken by one investor is matched by inflowing demand from the buying party on the other side.\u201d In terms of market dynamics, this means a new crop of investors is entering the market, as shown by the \u201crising share of wealth held by coins younger than 6 months in the Realized Cap HODL Waves, Glassnode wrote. The aggregate share of coins younger than 6 months has increased sharply since early 2023, rising to 47% up from 20% on Jan. 1, 2023. This metric reached between 84% and 95% during the last bull markets. \u201cAnalysts should start to pay more attention to the behavior of these new investors as their share of the capital increases.\u201d However, the chances of a sustained bullish rally over the next few weeks remain low due to profit-taking as Bitcoin trades above its 2021 all-time high. \u201cThe balance of wealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the \u2018Euphoria\u2019 phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

As more devices joined the decentralized Bitcoin network, the computing power required to successfully mine a BTC drastically increased.  A chart of Bitcoin\u2019s price performance around the previous three Bitcoin halvings. Source: bitcoinblockhalf.com/TradingView Building a Bitcoin mining rig has become a five-digit shopping experience, and the mining rewards are getting another cut in half with the 2024 Bitcoin Halving. Experts suggest that players unable to adapt their revenue model to the post-Halving era will go out of play due to the scalability of electricity spending becoming a key factor. Overall, average users have no chance at BTC mining using traditional methods, and this is where Web3 innovation comes in. Despite the changing landscape, one thing is clear: Satoshi Nakamoto didn\u2019t invent Bitcoin as an extra revenue stream for huge corporations. BTC was invented as people\u2019s money, and its rewards are meant to be distributed among individuals who contribute to the network. However, the initial investment required to mine BTC has created a massive barrier for individuals to enter the mining scene. On top of that, BTC mining through traditional facilities needs advanced financial and operational expertise along with access to cheap electricity to work in the long term, leaving it out of the reach of the majority of global users. GoMining, a global Bitcoin mining company, offers an innovative approach to lowering the entry barriers for individuals while making BTC mining globally accessible. It uses nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the most transformative product of Web3, as a critical component of individuals\u2019 mining rights. As the creator of the innovative Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate (LBH) protocol, GoMining gamifies the BTC mining operation by attaching the mining power \u2014 also known as hash rate \u2014 to NFTs. GoMining\u2019s approach makes BTC mining shareable, scalable and accessible to a global audience. Users can simply purchase an NFT from the GoMining platform as proof of their ownership of Bitcoin mining capacity with a specific configuration and start accumulating mining rewards from day one. The platform uses GOMINING as its native token, available on the Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain networks. GOMINING tokens are utilized for various on-platform payments, including NFT purchasing, upgrading and access to an additional 10% discount for electricity fees. GoMining offers a simplistic user experience: Starting to mine BTC through the platform is no different than buying an item from an NFT marketplace. In the background, however, GoMining utilizes years of experience in the crypto industry and nine data centers strategically placed across different parts of the world to offer a smooth journey for both mining enthusiasts and those considering mining as a promising way to diversify their passive income strategies.  GoMining hosts top-notch mining facilities worldwide to offer users a smooth experience. Source: GoMining GoMining NFTs are backed by an actual share of computing power, ranging between 1 and 5,000 terahashes per second. Users can simply click \u2018Create miner\u2019 to select their computing power and energy efficiency rate to start BTC mining or purchase any available digital miner from GoMining\u2019s secondary market or in any external marketplace, including OpenSea. Each NFT can be upgraded in computing power and energy efficiency attributes, allowing holders to scale their output with a few clicks. BTC mining rewards for holding an NFT are delivered daily to an internal or external wallet based on the holder\u2019s preferences. GoMining believes that efficient energy consumption will become a crucial point for maintaining the profitability of Bitcoin mining after the upcoming halving event. The company relies on two vital advantages to minimize risks for users\u2019 mining experience: access to one of the market\u2019s lowest electricity prices and highly efficient BTC mining devices. GoMining users get access to electricity at a rate as low as $0.05 per kWh, significantly lower than the electricity costs found in many countries. Moreover, these prices can be further discounted if users choose to engage with in-platform mechanics. From the user\u2019s perspective, GoMining\u2019s digital miners can be upgraded to the highest energy-efficiency standards, which can achieve up to 20 W/TH\u2014a rate comparable to the latest ASIC miners in the market. The company constantly works on expanding its mining capacity and regularly updates its equipment fleet to keep up with the most progressive devices. GoMining\u2019s commitment to technological advancement is further supported by its collaborations with top-notch niche companies and manufacturers. \u201cAt GoMining, we are dedicated to implementing environmentally friendly mining practices,\u201d said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan, adding: \u201cOur strategic partnerships, such as with Bitmain, enable us to utilize the most energy-efficient devices available.\u201d The CEO stressed that prioritizing the selection of data center locations ensures GoMining can access affordable electricity while avoiding areas with strained power grids. \u201cOur commitment to innovation drives us to develop energy-saving solutions like optimized cooling systems and AI monitoring. These efforts reflect our goal of maximizing profitability and contributing positively to the sustainability of the crypto mining industry, as well as giving a weighty advantage to our NFT holders in terms of their mining expenses optimization.\u201d The BTC mining ecosystem will use profitability as the primary driver regardless of the market state, and those with higher operating costs are likely to find themselves on the wrong side of the break-even calculations, according to Zalan. GoMining\u2019s innovative solution was developed to keep the mining industry\u2019s doors open for individuals willing to take part in the Bitcoin movement and get their contributions rewarded. Speaking of the Bitcoin mining future, Zalan pointed out that the two key cost drivers within the mining business are electricity and mining hardware. Miners that have continuously optimized the electricity costs and cost efficiency of their mining hardware will be well-positioned to excel following the next Bitcoin Halving, the GoMining CEO argued. The evolution of Bitcoin mining from a home-based venture to a highly specialized industry underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto world. With traditional mining methods becoming unfeasible for average users, GoMining\u2019s innovative approach, leveraging NFTs and the Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate protocol, presents a promising avenue for democratizing access to Bitcoin mining.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Mining, #Bitcoin Mining, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #NFT"},{"date":"Apr 09, 2024","summary":"","author":"Tristan Greene","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/fintech-funding-falls-lowest-levels-since-2017-crypto-surges","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Fintech funding falls to lowest levels since 2017 as crypto surges","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Global funding for fintech ventures has fallen to its lowest level in seven years, with a 16% quarter-over-quarter dip between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.

Developers can use USDC on zkSync to build on a stable foundation that is built to last and officially supported by Circle. With the addition of zkSync, USDC is now supported on 16 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum and others. Zero-knowledge proofs determine the integrity of a transaction without disclosing the supporting evidence. Meanwhile, rollups bundle transactions off the Ethereum main layer and club them into a single transaction.

Historically, the anticipation surrounding halving events has fostered a bullish sentiment, especially in the months that follow rather than on the exact date of the halving. This is attributed to the delayed impact of the reduced mining output on the market. Bitcoin miners, who are pivotal to this ecosystem, often choose not to liquidate their holdings daily. Instead, they accumulate, especially under the belief of an impending bullish market\u2014a sentiment strongly supported by Bitcoin's 59% appreciation year-to-date in 2024. This collective expectation of market appreciation further tightens the supply available for sale, potentially propelling prices upward. However, some analysts caution against overly simplistic expectations of post-halving price surges, pointing out that Bitcoin's price trajectory over the past 15 years has been shaped by a myriad of external factors. These include overall economic trends, investor risk appetite, monetary policies, and Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market. Given this complexity, relying solely on historical patterns from previous halvings may be overly optimistic. In preparation for the Bitcoin halving, professional traders are increasingly turning to options strategies. This approach allows for leveraging positions with a relatively small upfront deposit, sidestepping the direct risk of liquidation prevalent in futures markets. Notably, the open interest for options expiring on June 28 at Deribit has reached $4.5 billion, showcasing a significant imbalance between call (buy) and put (sell) options, with bullish positions outnumbering bearish ones by threefold. Yet, this high-level view requires a deeper analysis, as the cryptocurrency trading community tends to lean towards optimism. There are call options aiming as high as $140,000 and $200,000 for the June 28 expiry, which appear overly ambitious. Excluding bets on prices above $90,000, the realistic call options open interest is approximately $2.72 billion. Conversely, several put options were placed before Bitcoin's ascent over $50,000, diminishing their likelihood of profitability. Presently, there is a scant $250 million open interest in put options pegged at $57,000 or higher. Bitcoin's unexpected performance surge caught bears by surprise, whether due to unanticipated factors like the successful approval of a spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S., a drop in inflation to 3%, or the absence of a predicted global economic recession by June 28. Consequently, bearish scenarios linked to the Bitcoin halving appear increasingly improbable. Past speculations about a \"death spiral\" triggered by reduced block rewards and a consequent drop in miner participation have been consistently debunked. Bitcoin's network adjusts its difficulty every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks), ensuring stability even amid fluctuating hashrate levels. Considering a hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin's price drops to $47,000 by June 28, a 32% decrease from current levels, the put options open interest would be $422 million. In contrast, call options up to $46,000 account for a $670 million exposure, highlighting a market tilt towards neutral-to-bullish strategies for the Bitcoin halving, at least by the June 28 expiry.

The rally comes a day after TON Society developers set aside $5 million in Toncoin to incentivize users to verify their identity using palm-scanning technology. The project aims to enable digital identity verification for Telegram users over the next five years and will distribute 1 million TON to users participating in the proof-of-personhood program.

The crypto world was battered as well, with the cryptocurrency market plummeting in March of that year. Bitcoin (BTC) lost 52% of its dollar value in a day, and Ether (ETH) lost 43%, shaking up decentralized finance (DeFi) as it fell. The resulting lockdowns had a slower but more profound effect on crypto. As the world became housebound, screen time rose steadily, and interest in cryptocurrency soared, along with market capitalizations. Soon, emerging technologies were undergoing development and implementation at a pace previously unseen. The first steps in DeFi were taken in 2017 with the development of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO and Compound were early market leaders. In June 2020, Compound introduced yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, a method of arbitrage that shifted crypto assets to attain the highest interest, fees and rewards. It is now common practice. Related: Whales profit mightily from lucrative DeFi yield farming: Data shows Compound was also a pioneer in decentralization. COMP (COMP) was also the first governance token, enabling users to participate directly in the management of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). By the end of the year, decentralization was well underway at many DAOs. EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO A DAO is an organization governed by enforced digital rules, without hierarchical management. It\u2019s similar to Bitcoin in its attempt to get rid of all middlemen in transactions. By September 2020, DeFi collateral levels had jumped to $9 billion from the $700 million seen at the beginning of the year. Around that time, Bloomberg wrote: \u201cA cryptocurrency mania known as decentralized finance has helped to turn digital currencies into this year\u2019s best-performing asset by far.\u201d Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) also played an important role. These had already existed by 2020, with OasisDEX launching in 2016 and Uniswap appearing in 2018. A DEX allows users to trade crypto assets peer-to-peer\u2014 that is, without an intermediary. DEXs, in turn, gave rise to automatic market makers, which take advantage of yield farming. Related: The trouble with automated market makers The result of all this activity was a bubble, or a \u201cperiod of price explosion,\u201d which the crypto world knows as the DeFi Summer of 2020. The third Bitcoin halving occurred on May 11, 2020, just before the DeFi Summer commenced. The halving is an event where mining rewards are reduced by 50% after every 210,000 BTC is mined. In 2020, the reward for mining a block was reduced to 6.25 BTC. Related: Lots of action but no bull rally: Here\u2019s how the Bitcoin halving went down The halving is intended to prevent inflation by slowing the pace of mining, also increasing demand by slowing down production. BTC was selling for around $8,800 during the third halving. It saw small gains in July and August 2020 and began to see a significant upward price trajectory in October, rising to $63,000 by April 2021. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital items on a blockchain. They, too, date back several years, but it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that the market really took off. They are at the heart of today\u2019s real-world asset tokenization boom and have been used for ticketing, licensing, gaming, identity verification, music and a host of other purposes. Their earliest uses were for gaming, collectibles and artwork. CryptoKitties was an early look at things to come. The game, developed by Dapper Labs and launched in 2017, used NFTs to collect, trade and breed digital virtual cats. Cointelegraph later noted: \u201cThis digital cat-breeding blockchain game caused quite a bit of congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, peaking in 2020.\u201d The CryptoPunks series of collectibles also came out in 2017. Related: What remains in the NFT market now that the dust has settled? The Bored Ape Yacht Club line was launched in April 2021.

EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO In 2017, there were around 120,000 NFT users. Their numbers grew to 1 million in 2020, 3.5 million in 2021, then 9.9 million the following year. Revenue from NFTs jumped nearly 40,000% from 2019 to 2021 but declined precipitously in 2022. OpenSea, a marketplace founded in 2017, held 87% of the NFT market at the beginning of 2022, but trading volume fell by 99% in the course of the year. Regardless, revenue from NFTs continues to grow and is expected to reach $2.4 billion in 2024.

The footer of the website and the website\u2019s warrant canary were deleted according to a GitHub commit, which stated: \u201cThis commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.\u201d A warrant canary is usually some form of text or visual element \u2014 in the case of the Ethereum Foundation, a yellow bird \u2014 which some companies include on their websites to indicate they\u2019ve never been served with a government subpoena or document request. If a government agency does request information, the company may remove the text, implicitly suggesting to visitors that it has received a subpoena. The Ethereum Foundation removed this key section, indicating that the foundation is indeed under a confidential investigation. Due to the confidentiality clause, the Ethereum Foundation cannot offer further details. Citing anonymous tips, Fortune reported that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was opening a probe into the foundation as part of a campaign to classify Ethereum\u2019s underlying asset, Ether (ETH), as a commodity. The reported inquiry couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time, as the May deadlines for SEC approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approach. While the debate about whether Ether is a security has been going on for several years, doubts are now beginning to emerge. Why would the SEC investigate the Ethereum Foundation almost 10 years after its launch? Does the SEC have jurisdiction over an organization based in Switzerland? Will the upcoming spot Ether ETF be delayed due to this action? Most importantly, what would happen to Ethereum and the crypto market if it is classified as a security? The Ethereum Foundation cannot provide further details due to a confidential clause. While the Ethereum Foundation has received an inquiry from a state authority, this doesn\u2019t mean the organization is the subject of investigation. Carol Goforth, professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law specializing in business associations and securities regulation, explained the relevance of this detail to Cointelegraph: \u201cIf we assume the foundation is not the subject of the investigation, the SEC\u2019s power to mandate cooperation may be limited.\u201d The SEC may believe that the Ethereum Foundation has information that could help the commission in a different investigation, for example. Either way, Goforth explained that the foundation would be open to cooperation. She said the \u201cdesire to see Ether continue to be actively traded in U.S. markets\u201d would be a clear incentive to cooperate with the authorities. Recent: Virtual reality steps up as metaverse struggles to deliver An additional reason to collaborate with the SEC would be to help \u201cexplain why Ether does not meet the Howey investment contract test\u201d and, therefore, be used to prove that it\u2019s not a security. On the other hand, if the Ethereum Foundation were the subject of investigation, the SEC could take \u201ca couple of years to move from an investigation to a lawsuit,\u201d Goforth said. An ongoing investigation would be detrimental for Ethereum until the case is resolved and could affect decisions such as the approval of an Ether ETF and the further adoption of the asset \u2014 as exemplified by the cost of the Ripple/SEC lawsuit. Basel Ismail, CEO of investment analytics company Blockcircle, told Cointelegraph: \u201cIf Ethereum were to be classified as a security, it would be atrocious for the short-term market valuation of the entire crypto ecosystem.\u201d In his opinion, if a market-leading blockchain that is relatively decentralized and counts thousands of active developers globally turns out to be considered a security, then almost all crypto projects could fall into that category. For the trader, it would be \u201csafe to assume that any other ERC-20 token that raised capital using a similar funding mechanism will need to comply with the same registration processes and rules.\u201d In his opinion, the contagion effect could eventually \u201cdestroy many companies\u201d in the sector, as their treasury funds aren\u2019t deep enough to sustain such a shock. Crypto exchanges that list Ether and operate in the U.S. markets would automatically support an asset legally considered a security. The exchanges would, therefore, be forced to choose between delisting Ethereum from their platform or registering as securities broker-dealers with the SEC. Goforth explained that any trading platform that matches buyers and sellers has to register as a securities exchange or comply with an exemption, such as becoming an Alternative Trading System (ATS). Goforth said that both options require extensive disclosures and approval from the SEC. She further highlighted a crucial point that would probably force the crypto exchanges to select the path of delisting ETH before registering as a securities exchange. However, many exchanges may simply opt to de-list rather than undergo the significant process of registering with the SEC. As Goforth noted, once the crypto exchange wishes to register as a securities exchange, it cannot provide exchange services for any security asset unless that security is registered. Since the SEC has only officially declared Bitcoin as not being a security, the crypto exchange \u201cwould be at risk if it helped its customers to buy or sell any other cryptocurrency,\u201d as virtually no crypto assets are registered. In her opinion, this would be \u201ctantamount to saying don\u2019t do business in the United States.\u201d While Ether\u2019s significant market cap might be able to take the hit as Ether moved off of U.S. exchanges, the same cannot be said for most ERC-20 tokens. Ismail explained, \u201cLiquidity would be drained, and order books would be considerably more shallow, creating extreme price slippage and hindering the chances for market makers to stabilize the price of the asset for some time.\u201d What use is it worrying about possible effects if the Ethereum Foundation is based in Switzerland and the SEC is a U.S. regulator? The SEC may technically only have jurisdiction over companies in the United States, but Goforth explained that it could claim extraterritorial jurisdiction if the challenged activity has a material impact in the United States. A past example within the crypto industry occurred in 2020 when the SEC imposed a worldwide injunction against Telegram\u2019s planned issuance of its GRAM token. Telegram eventually had to return $1.2 billion and pay $18.5 million as a penalty despite not being based in U.S. territory. Goforth confirmed that no specific legal mandates require the Ethereum Foundation to cooperate. However, she highlighted how the SEC values cooperation and can consider that when deciding on which action to take. If the Ethereum Foundation did not collaborate, the SEC could issue a subpoena, legally forcing the organization to share any data the regulators request. If centralized exchanges did shut down ETH trading in the U.S. market, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) could become an alternative. The decentralized nature of such platforms, which makes them difficult for regulators to target, combined with their global reach, may allow Ethereum-based projects to engage in regulatory arbitrage. Sergey Gorbunov, CEO of Interop Labs and co-founder of the Axelar protocol, told Cointelegraph, \u201cIf ETH becomes a security, DEXs may largely maintain operations due to their decentralized global nature.\u201d However, he admitted that some challenges would emerge, such as \u201cnew compliance requirements in certain jurisdictions.\u201d For example, Gorbunov illustrated how this new regulation update could threaten DEXs that connect with centralized crypto exchanges for liquidity purposes. But, decentralization does not guarantee safety from regulators. U.S. authorities have demonstrated their ability to close down platforms, such as crypto mixer Tornado Cash, by targeting developers. Goforth noted that the SEC could target \u201csome founder group, promoters or other active participants,\u201d while Gorbunov said regulators could target individuals or organizations that support the open network, such as code validators or contributors. The implications of the SEC classifying Ethereum as a security appear grim. However, Ismail said that while it would be harmful to markets and adoption in the short term, there could be positive effects in the long run. The Ethereum Foundation and the SEC could find a resolution to the problem where the foundation would be forced to pay a \u201cmonstrous fine\u201d and register as a security in the U.S. markets. Recent: Dead metaverse? Public administration breathes new life into virtual tech Ether trading would then need to adhere to the same rules that apply to stocks or bonds. Ismail implied that this outcome would at least offer regulation clarity for the market participants. In his opinion, in the long term this could be beneficial for crypto market valuation. If the SEC brings the Ethereum Foundation to court, the conclusion would be binary \u2014 Ether is either a commodity or a security. Either outcome would create ripple effects on the token\u2019s market valuation, and the impact on the ecosystem built on the blockchain would be massive. It could become the most crucial lawsuit in the crypto ecosystem.","tags":"#Law, #Security, #Ethereum, #Investments, #SEC, #ERC-20, #Ether Price, #Cryptocurrency Investment, #Ethereum Price, #Regulation"},{"date":"Apr 09, 2024","summary":"","author":"William Suberg","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-analysis-cpi-whales-btc-price-below-69k","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin analysis eyes CPI as whales 'pressure' BTC price below $69K","type":"Blog","category":"Market Update","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) stayed indecisive after the April 9 Wall Street open amid a warning that macro data could spark further BTC price downside.

The survey, published on April 8, polled over 3,600 consumers. Slightly more than half (52%) agree that cryptocurrencies as a whole will be an \u201cimportant asset class and method of payment transactions\u201d in the future. A similar survey was conducted by Deutsche Bank in September 2023, which showed less than 40% confidence. The amount of respondents who consider crypto to just be a \u201cfad that will eventually fade\u201d has now dropped to less than 1%, according to the survey. The survey also looked at the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in light of the upcoming halving. Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect the price to be supported by regulation, central bank rate cuts and anticipation of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related: 10 days until halving: Bitcoin mining profitability won\u2019t necessarily fall A third of the survey participants said they expect Bitcoin to dip below the $20,000 price point by the end of 2024. This figure compares to 35% in February and 36% in January. However, only 10% expect Bitcoin to surpass $75,000 by year-end. This survey comes after much activity surrounding Bitcoin since the beginning of 2024. In January, the SEC approved the first U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in a record $1 billion daily net inflow on March 12. In mid-March, the cryptocurrency hit a new $73,794 all-time high and is anticipated to spike even further, with some estimates as high as a 160% increase after the halving, which means it could hit the $150,000 mark, according to some analysts. The halving is anticipated to occur in mid-April, with many predictions settling on April 20. This event is causing some analysts to take a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency for the year ahead, citing the heightened overall demand and other macroeconomic factors driving the price.

Nerayoff \u2014 known for publicly accusing Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin of fraud \u2014 filed a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) lawsuit suing the U.S. for $9.6 billion in damages for the extortion case brought against him in 2019. The legal battle lasted for about four years, with the U.S. government eventually dismissing the lawsuit in May 2023. According to the new SF-95 filing posted by FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, Nerayoff sued the federal government based on claims that its agents were aware of the baseless nature of the charges. He also argued that some agents engaged in harassment and intimidation tactics, including fabrication of evidence, in order to prosecute him for extortion. Nerayoffs\u2019s legal team believes that damages caused to Nerayoff\u2019s reputation and businesses are significant enough to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government. The filing reads: \u201cAs a direct and proximate result of the wrongful conduct of federal agents and/or officers, Mr. Nerayoff\u2019s well-being, personal life and career were irreparably harmed. [...] He incurred significant legal fees to defend himself while simultaneously losing income as a result of becoming a feared pariah in the crypto community.\u201d According to Terrett, Nerayoff hired prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz as a consultant on the case, who believes that the case is \u201cunusual.\u201d Nerayoff is a serial entrepreneur, attorney, inventor of multiple international patents and founder of the blockchain consulting firm Alchemist. He is also a blockchain pioneer, known for his early involvement in projects like Ethereum in 2015. Nerayoff was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alongside his Alchemist associate Michael Hlady in September 2019. Both Nerayoff and Hlady were charged with extortion, with authorities arguing that they threatened to \u201cdestroy a cryptocurrency startup if they were not paid millions of dollars\u201d in Ether (ETH). Related: Coinbase cleared in lawsuit over crypto transactions An early player in the cryptocurrency scene, Nerayoff has been at the center of diverse controversies and legal battles.

Nerayoff\u2019s allegations included various aspects of Ethereum\u2019s development and operations, including fraudulent initial coin offerings, personal misconduct, and collusion with corrupt officials. One of Nerayoff\u2019s claims is that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulators, which is referred to as \u201cETHGate\u201d in the community.

On April 9, Worldcoin announced two updates: The ability to unverify World IDs via permanent iris code deletion and in-person age verification checks. World ID holders can now unverify their World ID, which serves as a digital passport that verifies an individual\u2019s humanness using \u201corbs,\u201d which are devices that scan users\u2019 eyeballs to confirm that they are real humans. Unverifying the World ID includes permanently deleting the user\u2019s iris code, a numeric representation of their unique iris texture. The iris code ensures that individuals can only verify one World ID. Once deletion is requested, the individual\u2018s World ID will become invalid. To protect against fraud, the procedure will require a six-month \u201ccool-off\u201d period to ensure that individuals cannot immediately re-verify humanness. By the end of the cool-off period, users will have their iris code permanently deleted and made unrecoverable. Worldcoin\u2019s new unverify option was developed in consultation with third-party privacy and security experts, including the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA). According to the startup, BayLDA is Worldcoin\u2019s lead supervisory authority in the European Union. The second update \u2014 Worldcoin in-person age verification checks \u2014 are introduced to help ensure that the platform is available only to humans above the age of 18 years old. The update includes an on-site age verification check at all orb locations before World ID verification. Third-party personnel will perform the check before entering the venue, the announcement notes. \u201cWorldcoin has always required that individuals be a minimum of 18 years old to obtain a World ID,\u201d a spokesperson for Worldcoin told Cointelegraph, adding: \u201cIndividuals have always been asked to confirm they meet this requirement in the app, similar to other apps in wide use today.\u201d Altman, the creator of OpenAI \u2014 the firm behind the natural language processing chatbot ChatGPT \u2014 launched Worldcoin in July 2023 with the goal of providing a \u201cglobal financial and identity network based on proof of personhood.\u201d Worldcoin received mixed reactions from the community as many questioned its centralization, privacy and security.

DappOS, an intent execution network, secures $15.3 million in Series A funding led by Polychain to streamline on-chain outcomes. As the blockchain world rapidly expands, the rise of layer-1 (L1) and layer-2 (L2) blockchains marks the beginning of an exciting era. L1 blockchains serve as foundational networks, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, where all transactions are processed directly on the chain. However, with the growth of these networks came congestion and scalability challenges. Enter L2 solutions, such as Lightning Network for Bitcoin or optimistic rollups for Ethereum, designed to alleviate scalability issues by processing transactions off the main chain yet ensuring they are still secured by the underlying L1 blockchain.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s example of Ethereum as a layer-2 centric ecosystem from the 2024 Hong Kong Web3 Carnival The blooming ecosystem of L1s and L2s, each fostering its mini-ecosystem, is set to dramatically lower the barrier to launching new blockchains. The result? There is a potential explosion in the number of networks, with many attracting significant investment. The proliferation promises to fragment the Web3 ecosystem further, making navigation and interoperability a daunting task for users. Simultaneously, the advent of innovative decentralized applications (DApps) in realms like social finance and game finance is ushering in users from the conventional Web2 world. The newcomers, unaccustomed to the intricacies of blockchain technology, seek streamlined workflows and intuitive interfaces akin to what they\u2019re used to, further emphasizing the need for cohesive, user-friendly solutions. Amid this landscape of burgeoning blockchain technologies and the pressing need for streamlined, user-centric platforms, one solution emerges with a promise to bridge the gaps within the fragmented ecosystem. DappOS, an intent execution network, has secured $15.3 million in a Series A funding round, valuing the company at $300 million.  dappOS raised $15.3 million in a Series A round led by Polychain at a $300 million valuation. Source: dappOS Polychain spearheaded the round, which included contributions from a diverse group of investors, including Nomad Capital, IDG, Flow Traders and NGC. The financial injection is earmarked for operational expansion and further development efforts. Additionally, dappOS has gained recognition in the blockchain space, having been selected for the Binance Incubation Program\u2019s Season 5 in December 2022 and receiving seed round investment from Binance Labs and Sequoia China in July 2023. The project operates by creating a two-sided marketplace that addresses supply and demand within the blockchain ecosystem. On one side, service providers stake collateral to offer various execution services. On the other, developers utilize the platform to meet users\u2019 needs by efficiently turning specific intents into on-chain results. To enhance efficiency and cover various use cases, dappOS introduces the optimistic minimum stake (OMS) mechanism, which was developed to improve the network\u2019s security for intent-based tasks.  DappOS builds an intent-based infrastructure to solve scalability and complexity issues. Source: dappOS OMS mandates that each task be associated with a predefined value and potential compensation for failure, allowing for the execution of tasks before their outcomes are verified. If a task fails, the network employs a consensus process to slash the responsible service providers, ensuring users are either satisfied by the task\u2019s completion or compensated accordingly. DappOS\u2019 OMS system benefits both service providers, who are required to stake only slightly more than the total value of active intent tasks, and users, who enjoy cost-efficient and rapid task execution. The post-task verification process facilitates a decentralized verification strategy, bolstering the network\u2019s efficiency and security in handling diverse use cases. With over 20 corporate projects, including GMX, BENQI and QuickSwap, under its belt, dappOS has garnered a user community of over 350,000 and executed more than 1.5 million transactions. Amid a rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem and its complexities, dappOS offers a solution for streamlined, user-centric blockchain interactions. Its innovative approach promises to redefine how users and developers navigate the increasingly fragmented landscape of blockchain networks and applications.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Business, #Security, #Decentralization, #Funding, #Technology, #Adoption, #Scalability"},{"date":"Apr 09, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/analysts-150k-btc-top-10-days-before-halving","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"With 10 days to the halving, analysts predict $150K Bitcoin top","type":"Blog","category":"Bitcoin Halving","content":"With only 10 days left until the much-awaited halving, Bitcoin is still trading above the $70,000 psychological level, bolstering bullish long-term price predictions from market analysts.

However, the analysts note that there is more built-up selling pressure than in previous cycles due to Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high before the halving for the first time in crypto history. While this is a sign of confidence for Bitcoin bulls, it could also introduce significant selling pressure, as 1.87 million BTC, or 9.5% of the circulating supply, was bought above the $60,000 mark. The analysts noted: \u201cThis underscores the active engagement of Short-Term Holders at higher prices, reflecting evolving ownership dynamics amidst market activity and institutional influence through spot ETFs. Increased entity movement suggests a shift in the cycle towards the gradual distribution of dormant supply and profit-taking.\u201d However, Bitcoin prices could see a sharp decline during the halving period due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative tightening, which is removing liquidity from markets.

The debate on whether artificial intelligence (AI) poses a global threat often misses a crucial point: the real danger lies not in AI itself but in its potential monopolization by the tech giants \u2014 commonly known as Big Tech \u2014 and governmental bodies. These powerful entities can misuse AI to subtly shape public perceptions and behaviors to serve their own ends, whether for profit maximization or political control. Far from being a dystopian fantasy, this scenario reflects our current reality, demanding immediate intervention. Data ownership lies at the heart of the issues with AI technology. Big Tech has effectively appropriated the collective knowledge of humanity, training their large language models (LLMs) on free information and then locking it behind $20 monthly subscriptions. Google's $60 million annual investment for access to Reddit\u2019s treasure trove of user-generated content underscores the disparity between the value created by community contributions and the compensation (or lack thereof) received by those contributors. Against this backdrop, Assisterr \u2014 a Cambridge-based data layer for decentralized AI \u2014 positions itself as a force for change by creating an infrastructure that backs decentralized AI data inference and a network of community-owned SLMs, empowering the very people who feed the data ecosystem.  Assisterr provides a data infrastructure layer for small language models. Source: Assisterr SLMs represent a targeted approach to AI, honed to address specific use cases with greater efficiency and lower costs compared to their larger counterparts. Marrying efficiency with high-quality assistance, SLMs excel in automating and enhancing real-time interactions and support for developers within the Web3 ecosystem. Assisterr\u2019s integration of blockchain technology facilitates a transparent mechanism for tracking community contributions and incentivizes the sharing of previously inaccessible knowledge and data through rewards. Community-owned SLMs have two pivotal advantages against LLMs: Assisterr addresses the reluctance of individuals and organizations to share data, a key challenge in developing AI-powered solutions, by creating an infrastructure designed for the quick setup of models and a framework that encourages data sharing through incentives.

Following previous halvings, smaller mining firms were forced out of business due to the decreased block rewards. However, this will be different after the 2024 halving due to the increasing network fees boosted by Ordinals inscriptions and Bitcoin-native decentralized finance, or BTCFi, Benayoun told Cointelegraph: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen NFTs popping up on the Bitcoin blockchain, and we\u2019ve seen a number of projects trying to build DeFi on the Bitcoin network. So all those elements are leading to an increase in network fees.\u201d Bitcoin network fees are transaction fees paid to incentivize miners to include a transaction in the following block.

Downie explained: \u201c[Bitcoin halvings] make a lot of older hardware less profitable due to less reward received for the work done by the machine.

The collaboration, announced on April 9, marks a step forward in Farmsent\u2019s goal of decentralizing the agricultural supply chain to enhance transparency in the global food trade and build a global Web3 marketplace that connects farmers directly with consumer-facing businesses worldwide. By leveraging a DePIN of sensors to track product quality and provenance, Farmsent claims it can eliminate centralized intermediaries and reduce costs for all stakeholders, all while ensuring transparency across the supply chain. Cointelegraph talked to Yog Shusti, the co-founder and CEO of Farmsent, about the use case of DePINs in the agricultural sector. Shusti called Farmsent\u2019s DePIN use case \u201cparticularly exciting for agriculture\u201d because the technology is leveraged to benefit farmers and consumers. \u201cIt provides farmers with secure digital identities for better market access but also empowers them with real-time data about their crops. This includes crucial details like soil moisture, pH content, and humidity.\u201d He said this information allows farmers to make \u201cdata-driven decisions\u201d to optimize crop health and yields. Meanwhile, the DePIN system allows consumers to access information about the food they purchase: \u201cThis could include details about the farm\u2019s practices, the origin of the food, and how it was grown. It empowers consumers to make informed choices about the food they put on their tables.\u201d Related: Weather forecasting for developing regions: Here\u2019s how Web3 can help Currently, the state of the global food trade highlights the urgent need for change. Farmers, despite being the backbone of the industry, often receive a disproportionately low share of the value captured in the market. According to Farmsent, it plans to address this by bypassing traditional intermediaries and enabling direct transactions between farmers and consumers and already has over 160,000 farmers onboarded in Indonesia and Colombia. The platform, currently still in beta, is being used to track coffee, avocados and palm sugar between Indonesia, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates \u2014 where it already has a license to operate \u2014 and the United States. Farmsent said it is currently working on securing three additional licenses. Shusti said that storing large amounts of data from sensors, farms and partners can become expensive on traditional blockchains: \u201cAs Farmsent expands its reach to new markets and connects with more farmers and consumers, the volume of data and transactions within the network will inevitably surge.\u201d Therefore, he said that Peaq was chosen for its ability to cost-effectively store data and scale at large. The Peaq network has been gaining traction, and it recently secured $15 million in a Series A round led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital. In the past, it has worked on DePIN projects alongside major companies such as Bosch and even worked to tokenize 100 Teslas in a decentralized Web3 ride-sharing initiative across Europe. Handling the transactions and data of farmers and business owners worldwide is not only a big feat for scaling purposes but also in keeping all that information safe and secure. According to the Farmsent CEO, its DePIN network gathers information from three sources. In one, it is entered by humans and then validated. Information on farm practices, harvest details and initial processing can be manually entered by authorized personnel and validated for accuracy. It can also be collected through Internet of Things (IoT) sensors placed throughout the supply chain (farms, storage facilities, transport) that can continuously monitor conditions like temperature, humidity and freshness. Lastly, data is procured from third-party partners like logistics companies that provide data relevant to transport and storage conditions. To keep this data secure, Shusti told Cointelegraph that Farmsent leverages Peaq decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enhance data privacy further: \u201cDIDs act like unique identifiers on the blockchain that can be linked to data without revealing the actual data itself. \u201d He said that this allows for data verification and controlled access while protecting sensitive information. Till Wendler, the co-founder of Peaq, said this use case within the agriculture industry is not just exciting but also one of the \u201cmost important ones\u201d due to its promise to push back global food insecurity and \u201cdeliver cheaper and more quality produce to people around the world\u201d \u2014 and in a secure manner.

There is a current maximum supply of 250 million SUSHI (SUSHI) tokens under the existing tokenomics model. Additionally, Sushi Labs will be the sole beneficiary of future airdrops awarded by protocols and partners. Voting began on April 3 and is set to end on April 10. So far, around 29 million SUSHI has been pledged, which is more than enough to reach a quorum.

NFT sales volumes for all blockchains have slid for the fifth week in a row after reaching a year-to-date high in early March led by a significant drop in Ethereum NFT sales. CryptoSlam! data shows the daily total NFT sales volume peaked this year on March 4 at over $80.4 million, which has slid over 50% to nearly $39.4 million five weeks later on April 8. Ethereum NFT sales volumes have seen a significant downturn, with 30-day figures seeing a nearly 48% drop to $363.3 million \u2014 larger than the drops seen by market leader Bitcoin at 13.5%, Solana at over 15% and Polygon\u2019s nearly 34%.

Data showed that over 75% of non-vote Solana transactions failed on April 4 amid the recent memecoin mania on the network, but that figure has since fallen to 64.8%. Mumtaz said the issue concerns the way in which Solana developers implemented \u201cQUIC\u201d \u2014 a Google-developed data transfer protocol that loops all nodes in on the current state of the network. But this implementation issue shouldn\u2019t be seen as an overall design flaw, according to Mumtaz, using car design as an example to explain the situation. All cars have four tires and an engine, but \u201cthere are many implementations of the car design,\u201d like BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, F1 and Tesla, he explained. If one BMW model is poor at steering, then \u201cwe don\u2019t say that all cars are flawed\u201d \u2014 instead, we say that specific model is broken and needs a fix, he added. Similarly, Solana\u2019s implementation of QUIC has certain deficiencies and bugs in its current state, Mumtaz explained. \u201cHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean \u2018Solana\u2019 has a design flaw \u2014 it means it chose a buggy implementation for this part of its design.\u201d In other words, Solana needs to change a tire rather than recreate an entirely new model or network in blockchain terms.

According to the April 8 filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s pushback will impact options trading on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and any other trust that holds Bitcoin on the NYSE. \u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change,\u201d the securities regulator said. The next deadline for the SEC to either approve, deny or delay the proposed rule change on the NYSE is on May 29. The securities regulator reached the same outcome for Nasdaq last month, which requested options trading on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Options are derivative products that provide traders leverage and let them make directional bets on the market.

While some may hastily point to the inflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) as the primary factor, this perspective overlooks the broader motivations for buyers to push the price higher. It is more plausible that a range of macroeconomic factors played a key role in Bitcoin's recent price rally. It seems misguided to assert that the surge in BTC's value was solely due to the purchase of $500 million in Bitcoin by the Ethena stablecoin USDCe as collateral. For instance, MicroStrategy\u2019s acquisition of 9,245 Bitcoin, valued at over $600 million on March 19, did not prevent a 13.7% drop in BTC price in the subsequent six days. Given Bitcoin's daily spot volumes exceeding $10 billion, such inflows are relatively insignificant. Investors' expectations regarding the economy and the cost of capital should not be underestimated. Periods of increased liquidity and monetary policies aimed at stimulating consumption and growth usually benefit scarce assets, a trend that is magnified during times of persistent inflation when salaries and prices rise to match the increasing availability of money. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently indicated in a shareholder letter that the resilience of the U.S. economy could \"lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect,\" as reported by Yahoo Finance. This insight helps partially explain why gold ETF instruments are trading at a premium in China, as investors brace for inflationary pressures amid the U.S.'s precarious fiscal debt situation. Eric Balcunhas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that Chinese investors are \"desperate to buy assets unlinked to their own economy/stock market,\" which has led to gold ETFs trading at 30% above their fair value in China. The U.S. government's deficit is further strained by a $1.2 trillion spending package approved on March 23 and President Joe Biden's proposal to forgive up to $20,000 of student debt for 23 million borrowers, regardless of income, thereby exacerbating concerns over fiscal sustainability. One might contend that the aforementioned dynamics do not inherently favor Bitcoin, as heightened inflation diminishes the populace's disposable income, and the inexorable escalation of U.S. debt is likely to precipitate an economic downturn. Nonetheless, predicting how investors will react to such occurrences remains challenging, given Bitcoin's fluctuating correlation with traditional assets like stocks and gold. Moreover, escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China could have spurred the increased interest in both gold and Bitcoin. Intriguingly, gold prices soared to a record high of $2,354 on April 8, a development that coincided with the U.S. Treasury 2-year yield reaching its highest level in over four months at 4.79%. Conventionally, gold's value tends to wane when investors favor the yields from fixed-income investments; however, this trend was conspicuously absent in the recent surge. Related: Bitcoin \u2018pretty unlikely\u2019 to revisit $50K price level, says analyst On April 8, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen disclosed that the administration is contemplating potential tariffs on subsidized Chinese energy products, including solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, and electric vehicles. Yellen also noted that other nations might consider implementing trade restrictions against China, as reported by CNBC. Within this context, the surge in Bitcoin's value to $72,000 on April 8 may be attributed to investors seeking a hedge against the deteriorating state of global economic relations and the ramifications of U.S. government stimulus initiatives, rather than being driven by sporadic and unpredictable Bitcoin inflows from specific investors.

However, analysts at Steno Research anticipate that it will be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event. There have been three halving events in Bitcoin\u2019s history, reducing miner rewards from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, 12.5 BTC in 2016 and 6.25 BTC at the last halving on May 11, 2020. Steno Research says that BTC is likely to repeat the 2016 halving with selling pressure sustained for up to four months after. \u201cWe foresee the next Bitcoin halving as a short-term \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, echoing the 2016 halving\u2019s pattern, this time around even with heightened anticipation from Bitcoin ETF [exchange-traded fund] holders,\u201d the research firm stated. Steno Research expects a surge in BTC\u2019s value leading up to the halving event. However, it says the value could \u201cdip below its price at the time of the halving\u201d within the first 90 days following the halving. Steno Research analysts identified parallels between BTC price performance before and after the 2016 halving, indicating that similar outcomes can be expected from the upcoming event. The report noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price remained below its pre-halving level for the entire 90 days following the halving. \u201cSpecifically, on the 90th day post-halving, Bitcoin was priced 8.4% lower than before the halving,\u201d Steno Analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote. According to data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin daily mining rewards are at their highest ever as the price trades close to its all-time high. This implies that even though the number of BTC issued will be the smallest yet, after the halving, the value of this issuance will be high when measured in dollars. The report explained that with the current price at approximately $71,563, this reduction now translates to $224,512 worth of Bitcoin, compared to the $55,000 the miners received after the last halving. \u201cBitcoin miners have never earned as much as they have in recent months.\u201d As such, miners are likely to sell all their Bitcoin over time to cover the costs associated with their mining operations, the report noted. This then contributes to the sell-side pressure that causes the BTC price to correct after months after the halving. Related: Bitcoin Bollinger Band signal suggests BTC could double by July Further, the report explained that the halving is a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s price once selling pressure from miners reduces.

Speaking at the annual SEC Speaks conference, Peirce said that a \u201cparticularly pernicious weed\u201d had sprung up in the SEC\u2019s \u201csecret garden\u201d of policy guidelines. Her comments came in response to the Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which prevents banks from custodying crypto assets on behalf of clients. Meanwhile, Gurbir Grewal, the director of the Division of Enforcement at the SEC, has pushed back against criticism that the regulator is making up rules on crypto as it goes along. At the same SEC Speaks event, Grewal claimed that companies in the crypto industry had made \u201cmany creative attempts\u201d to avoid the commission\u2019s jurisdiction by continuing to operate in the United States. Grewal reiterated that the SEC\u2019s standard for determining security under the Howey test had been \u201cclearly and consistently applied.\u201d He did not specifically address reports that the SEC had been exploring whether to classify Ether (ETH) as a security rather than a commodity under the U.S. Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s purview. The SEC is currently soliciting comments from the public on proposed rule changes allowing the listing and trading of shares of three spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on exchanges. Upon publication in the Federal Register, the public has 21 days to respond to spot ETH ETF applications from asset managers Bitwise, Fidelity and Grayscale. Bitwise and Grayscale propose listing their ETH ETFs on NYSE Arca, and Fidelity will launch its ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

Recent analysis from industry experts at Omnia Health, the Iranian Journal of Public Health, and Medical Tourism Magazine shines a light on how nascent telemedicine technology built on the metaverse concept can onboard and streamline patient acquisition and improve patient satisfaction for medical tourists. Medical tourism is a form of travel in which patients leave their home country to pursue medical treatments in foreign territories. This can be done for quality reasons, if patients believe they can receive better care outside of their home, for financial reasons to help mitigate the costs of local healthcare, or for myriad other reasons. In 2022, a team of researchers from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Shiraz, Iran penned an op-ed in the Iranian Journal of Public Health explaining the benefits of preparing patients for medical tourism via the metaverse. \u201cBecoming familiar with the tourist attractions of the destination city or country through Metaverse can raise potential tourists\u2019 enthusiasm and excitement to decide for this medical travel,\u201d the researchers wrote, adding that \u201cmoreover, Meta-based simulation of the hospital environment can increase patients\u2019 awareness and experiences of the environment that awaits them, thereby reducing their stress, helping them feel more secure, and leading to a better doctor-patient relationship and a higher rate of patient satisfaction.\u201d According to a report by Omnia Health, the medical tourism industry was worth approximately $54 billion in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic had a slowing effect on the industry\u2019s growth, however, and in 2024, it\u2019s valued at approximately $47 billion. A report from Statista indicates that it\u2019s forecasted to grow to over $111 billion before the end of the decade. This indicates a compound annual growth rate of 19.58%. In October 2022, the Thumbay Hospital network launched what appears to be the first fully functional metaverse hospital featuring patient services and fees in cryptocurrency.

This shows that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are buying on dips. CoinShares data shows digital investment products saw $646 million in inflows last week. That takes the year-to-date inflows to $13.8 billion, far higher than the $10.6 billion in 2021. On-chain analytics firm Santiment said in a X post that inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are likely to remain high until the Bitcoin halving. However, the firm added \u201cit will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterward.\u201d It is difficult to determine how the markets will behave just after halving, but analysts remain bullish on the long term. SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin could soar to $170,000 during the cycle. Eventually, he expects Bitcoin to trade at \u201chalf the valuation of gold\u201d but warns of volatility en route. What are the important resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out. The S&P 500 Index made an outside-day candlestick pattern on April 4 and an inside-day candlestick pattern on April 5, indicating uncertainty about the next directional move. The 20-day exponential moving average (5,184) has flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price turns lower and breaks below 5,146, it will signal the start of a corrective phase. The 50-day simple moving average (5,089) may try to arrest the decline, but it is likely to be broken. Conversely, if the price continues higher and breaks above the all-time high of 5,265, the index will resume its uptrend. The next stop is likely to be 5,450. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) turned down sharply from the 105 overhead resistance level on April 2, signaling that the bears are active at higher levels. However, a minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they did not allow the index to slide below the moving averages. This suggests that lower levels are being purchased. Selling at higher levels and buying on dips signals a possible range-bound action in the near term. The index may swing between the 50-day SMA (104) and 105 for some time. A break and close above 105 clears the path for a potential rally to 106 and then 107. On the contrary, a drop below the 50-day SMA could sink the index to 103 and subsequently to 102. Bitcoin broke above the symmetrical triangle pattern on April 8, indicating that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The BTC/USDT pair is likely to retest the all-time high of $73,777. This level may act as a significant barrier, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend toward the pattern target of $84,000. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA ($68,335). If that happens, the pair may plunge to the 50-day SMA ($64,828). Ether (ETH) has been trading between $3,056 and $3,679 for several days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. The ETH/USDT pair has reached the overhead resistance of $3,679, an important level to keep an eye on. If buyers overcome this obstacle, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $4,093. The bears are expected to fiercely defend this level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend toward $4,488. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from $3,679 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the range-bound action may continue for a while longer. BNB (BNB) continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The 20-day EMA ($570) is moving up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are at a minor advantage. The BNB/USDT pair has reached the downtrend line of the triangle. If this resistance is overcome, the pair could retest the March 16 high at $645. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will suggest that the pair may remain inside the triangle for a few more days. The bears will be in a commanding position if the price plunges below the triangle. The bulls are struggling to sustain Solana (SOL) above the 20-day EMA ($181), indicating that the bears are defending the level. If the price turns down from the current level, the SOL/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $162. The bulls are expected to vigorously protect this level because failing to do that could open the gates for a fall to $126. Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $162 and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may extend its stay inside the $162 to $205 range for some more time. The next leg of the uptrend could begin on a break above $205. The failure of the bears to capitalize on XRP\u2019s (XRP) fall below the uptrend line may have attracted buyers who pushed the price above the moving averages on April 8. The flattish moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. The XRP/USDT pair could swing between $0.56 and $0.69 for a few more days. Buyers will have to kick the price above $0.69 to enhance the prospects of a rally to the formidable resistance at $0.74. Instead, if bears want to take charge, they will have to sink and sustain the price below $0.56. The pair may then plunge to $0.52 and subsequently to $0.48. Related: Here\u2019s what happened in crypto today Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped back above the 20-day EMA ($0.18) on April 6 and continued the move higher to rise above $0.19 on April 7. The bulls will try to maintain the momentum and push the price toward the overhead resistance at $0.23. A break and close above this level will signal the resumption of the uptrend. The DOGE/USDT pair will then attempt a rally to $0.30. On the contrary, if the price slips back below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That will increase the likelihood of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.15). The bulls successfully held Cardano (ADA) above $0.57 in the past few days and pushed the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.62) on April 8. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears are in command. The sellers will try to sink the price below $0.57. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. That could start a downward move toward the next major support at $0.46. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. That will open the doors for a rise to $0.68. Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to increase the possibility of a rally to $0.81. Toncoin (TON) skyrocketed above the $5.50 to $5.69 overhead resistance zone on April 8, indicating the start of the next leg of the uptrend. If buyers maintain the price above $5.69, the TON/USDT pair could rally to the next target objective at $7.09. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in control. The bears will have to tug the price below $5.50 to trap the aggressive bulls. That could result in long liquidation, threatening the 20-day EMA ($4.97). If this level gives way, the pair may slump to $4.72 and then to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.22.

This increased bullish sentiment pushed Ether price up over 5% on April 8. The fact that Ether trades above $3,600 could indicate that attention is shifting toward Ether and in the past year, the altcoin has seen its price rise by 96.2%. Let\u2019s review a few of the reasons for Ether\u2019s price strength. Ether's ongoing rise versus the U.S. dollar coincides with its equally strong gains against Bitcoin (BTC). Notably, the widely-tracked ETH/BTC pair gained roughly 1.5% on April 8 to reach back above the key 0.05 BTC level, suggesting a possible rotation of capital in the short term. Additionally, Ether\u2019s performance against the broader cryptocurrency market has improved significantly over the last 24 hours, highlighted by an almost 2% increase in the Ethereum Dominance Index (ETH.D) from its monthly low on April 7. This trend underscores a rising flow of capital into the Ether market from competing altcoins, bolstering ETH\u2019s value. Ether\u2019s latest gains precede a period of accumulation among its richest investors, also known as whales. According to data resource Glassnode, entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have increased their Ether reserves daily since March 17. Related: Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 design flaws are a crypto scammer\u2019s best friend Interestingly, this accumulation pattern has often been a precursor to significant price upside, such as the one Ether is witnessing today. A surge in traders\u2019 interest in Ether began on Nov. 5, 2023, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale Investment\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum trust into an ETF. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed for a spot Ether ETF on Nov. 9. The confirmation sent Ether\u2019s price to a 6-month high at the time. As of April 8, a total of seven spot Ether ETFs have been filed and are pending with the SEC. On April 3, the SEC called for comments on the Fidelity, Grayscale and Bitwise spot Ether ETFs. Related: Plotting the path to $80K \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week According to CoinShares data, institutional investors pushed $13.8 billion into crypto investment products year to date in 2024. For context, for the entire year of 2021, crypto products set a record with $10.6 billion in yearly inflows. Despite outflows from institutional investors into Ether for four straight weeks, the second-largest crypto by market cap has seen $52 million flow into investment products in 2024. In total, Ether investment products have $14.1 billion in assets under management. While the current market looks healthy, macroeconomic factors like future rate hikes and the potential U.S. crackdown on the crypto sector may slightly weigh on Ether\u2019s price. Factors such as a spot Ether ETF approval, positive developments in clarifying regulators\u2019 stance on crypto and a strong U.S. economy may be catalysts for price growth.

The Web3 space faces challenges in user engagement and community growth. Central to these issues are malicious entities, including bots and bad actors, which erode the foundation of trust and security that Web3 endeavors to build. The low participation problem is particularly pronounced in sectors beyond decentralized finance (DeFi), where projects focused on nonfungible token (NFT) infrastructure strive to carve out a niche. NFT infrastructure initiatives often grapple with lower engagement levels, underscoring a need for mechanisms that entice and reward users in impactful ways. Amid these challenges, experience point (XP) systems emerge as a promising avenue to boost user engagement across the Web3 landscape. However, for such systems to truly harness their potential and draw in a diverse user base, they must break free from the confines of blockchain dependency. By creating XP systems that are blockchain agnostic, projects can appeal to users from any blockchain protocol, widening their reach and impact. The Itheum Protocol is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable data ownership and trade via Data NFTs, which aims to transform data management, ownership and exchange with security and transparency. The Itheum ecosystem introduces a game-style XP system called BiTz, designed to enhance user engagement and differentiate legitimate users from bots or bad actors. Not bound to a single blockchain, the BiTz system integrates with Itheum\u2019s omni-chain features, inviting users across various blockchains to participate and mint their data as Data NFTs.  Itheum hosts a blockchain-agnostic XP system powered by Data NFTs. Source: Itheum The BiTz XP system encourages users to actively participate, rewarding them as they climb the platform\u2019s monthly and all-time-high leaderboards based on their accumulation of BiTz, the smallest data XP unit within the Itheum Protocol. Leaderboards foster competition and community among users. Top performers receive benefits like airdropped Data NFTs from past and future data creators, boosts on monthly Itheum Trailblazer quest rewards and future perks such as giveaways and merchandise. To acquire BiTz, users must possess a BiTz-compatible Data NFT in their wallet, enabling them to participate in the \u201cGet \u201d game. Initially, these Data NFTs were distributed to early supporters of the Itheum Protocol through airdrops. However, users who didn\u2019t receive the airdrops can purchase BiTz-compatible Data NFTs on various NFT marketplaces.

The fund will also address workers who may be impacted by the AI boom, which will receive up to $36.8 million under Canada\u2019s Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program to re-train and re-skill across various industries. Employees in the film and animation industries are most at risk of losing their jobs to generative AI, according to a recent report from consultancy firm CVL Economics. The remaining $36.8 million will be used to create a Canadian AI Safety Institute to further the safe development and deployment of AI. Canada claims it was the first country in the world to introduce a national AI strategy when it introduced the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2017, aimed at driving the adoption of AI through research and commercialization.

In an April 7 post to X, Kang said a new class of \u201cculture coins\u201d \u2014 memecoins centered around cultural values such as politics, brands, religion and lifestyle \u2014 have the capacity to be far more \u201cviral\u201d than the popular memecoins of the last cycle such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). \u201cCommunities with strong values and identities naturally try to convert others to their beliefs and publicly display what it is they love about their lifestyle. They are inherently viral.\u201d \u201cThe ideologies of these communities can be purely about politics, religion, consumer goods, sport, way of life or can be a mixture of all,\u201d added Kang. Kang noted two specific Solana-based memecoins \u2014 Jeo Boden (BODEN) and Doland Tremp (TREMP) \u2014 as recent examples of culture coins that grew rapidly out of communities harboring \u201canti-woke, anti-Biden, and right-wing views.\u201d BODEN has grown massively since its launch on March 9, posting gains of well over 700,000% since inception. At time time of publication, BODEN boasts a market capitalization of $473 million and stands as the 191st-largest token by total value, per CoinGecko data. The Donald Trump parody coin TREMP has also posted significant gains since its launch on Feb. 27 but didn\u2019t gain as much traction as BODEN. It currently touts a market cap of $73 million, per Birdeye data. Outside of politics, Kang suggested memecoins that draw their likeness from successful consumer brands \u2014 specifically naming ZYN and MOUTAI as his firm\u2019s investments \u2014 could ride on the coattails of brands in a \u201ccircular economy\u201d of gains. \u201cCompared to animal coins, coins that represent consumer brands can have the additional advantage of leveraging the associated lifestyle of that brand for added virality,\u201d Kang added. Related: ZachXBT won\u2019t assist after memecoin devs throw tokenholders under the bus Overall, Kang suggested that the decision to invest in memecoins wasn\u2019t too far from investing in regular assets that achieve outsized returns. \u201cThe assets that pump the hardest (stocks, real estate, metals, coins, etc) are simply assets that people can best believe in,\u201d he said. However, crypto industry pundits remain divided on the impact of memecoins on the sector. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes memecoins are a \u201cnet positive\u201d for their respective blockchain networks. In contrast, others say they\u2019re a dangerous, speculative mess that betrays the founding principles of blockchain technology. Regardless of their effect on the ecosystem, memecoins have established themselves as the most profitable sector within crypto for the first quarter of this year. According to a market report from CoinGecko, the 10 largest memecoins recorded an average gain of 1,312.6% for holders in Q1 2024. \u201cThe memecoin narrative was 4.6 times more profitable than the next best-performing crypto narrative of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and 33.3 times more profitable than the layer 2 narratives with the lowest returns in Q1 this year,\u201d said CoinGecko analyst Lim Yu Qian.

Lawmakers introduced the draft bill on April 4, claiming illegal cryptocurrency mines steal power and disrupt the country\u2019s electricity supply. If passed, the ban would last 180 days or until new laws are enacted and the national power grid operator can ensure it can supply sufficient energy. But a ban on lawful miners operating in the region could prove costly for the South American country, according to Hashlabs Mining co-founder and chief mining strategist Jaran Mellerud, who recently spoke with Cointelegraph: Banning Bitcoin mining could cost Paraguay more than $200 million a year, assuming the country has 500 megawatts of legal miners paying $0.05 per kilowatt-hour in operating expenses.\u201d Markets of this size aren\u2019t common in Paraguay either, which boasts a rather small population of 6.8 million people and the 94th-largest gross domestic product in the world at $41.7 billion, according to Worldometer, citing 2022 data. Bitcoin (BTC) mining has provided a \u201csignificant, positive contribution to Paraguay\u2019s trade balance\u201d until this point, Mellerud argued. Bitcoin mining firms currently need to register and receive authorization from the Paraguayan Ministry of Industry and Commerce. If passed, the bill may impact one of the industry\u2019s largest players, Marathon Digital Holdings, which started deploying 27 megawatts around the Itaipu hydroelectric power plant last November. The Itaipu Dam has become a popular site for miners to set up, as it supplies all of Paraguay\u2019s local electricity needs and leaves a large amount of excess electricity to tap into. This excess electricity has historically been exported to Brazil at low prices. However, Mellerud noted that a wave of Bitcoin miners has swooped in at slightly higher prices in recent months. But lawmakers say there have been 50 cases of interrupted power supply linked to cryptocurrency miners illegally tapping into these electricity sources since February alone. The country\u2019s National Electricity Administration estimates each cryptocurrency mining operation has caused damages and losses up to $94,900. Total annual losses in the Alto Paran√° area \u2014 where the Itaipu power plant is based \u2014 could be up to $60 million. \u201cIllegal operations can be harmful to the grid if it draws too much electricity from low voltage lines,\u201d Mellerud acknowledged.

Mellerud previously told Cointelegraph that Paraguay and Argentina would take in an influx of United States-based miners looking to expand or even migrate to the energy-rich nations due to lower electricity costs. The controversy in Paraguay comes as Bitcoin miners prepare for the upcoming Bitcoin halving event expected to take place on April 20, which will slice miner rewards from 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC) ($434,000) to 3.125 BTC ($217,000).

ATHEX announced the move in early March in collaboration with the Sui blockchain ecosystem to have securities minted as digital certificates for enhanced security, efficiency and transparency for its users. The primary issuance process traditionally involves separate confirmations for securities allocation and settlement. However, integrating blockchain simplifies this by merging them into a single, streamlined confirmation. This could translate to faster and more efficient transactions for everyone involved \u2014 the exchange, its members, investors and, most, importantly, issuers raising capital. Cointelegraph spoke with a representative from Sui to better understand its collaboration with ATHEX and its blockchain being used to level up operations in a traditional finance (TradFi) setting. Related: Wall Street\u2019s new asset class: Will Grayscale survive the Bitcoin ETF era? One of the primary motivators for integrating blockchain into a highly sensitive network \u2014 like a stock exchange dealing with billions of dollars on a daily basis \u2014 is a significant security boost. Digital certificates, inherent to blockchain transactions, provide an advanced layer of security alongside being on a public, immutable ledger, which can help eliminate the risk of manipulation \u2014 a persistent challenge in TradFi. This transparency extends to regulatory oversight, allowing regulators to easily monitor trade activities for suspicious behavior. The Sui spokesperson commented: \u201cCentralized processes of primary issuance have fallen victim to bad actors in the space for decades and malpractices of non-transparent allocation.\u201d \u201cAlso having an immutable, public ledger reflecting trades would simplify regulators\u2019 ability to monitor trading activities for suspicious transactions or improper allocations,\u201d they said. They noted that this particular use case is suited for decreasing the risk of primary issuance and increasing the overall efficiency of capital raising, price formation and transparent allocation. EBB aims to be a future fundraising tool, allowing early-stage and mature companies to list transferable securities. According to the Sui representative, the Greek stock exchange\u2019s EBB places it at \u201cthe forefront of innovation [\u2026] in comparison to exchanges around the world.\u201d \u201cATHEX has made a successful use of the EBB,\u201d they said, \u201cto re-launch their corporate bond market with a large demand from retail and with significant oversubscription.\u201d The goal in leveraging blockchain technology is to increase innovation while having the safety, security and transparency that individuals and regulators require.\u201d They also advised that when implementing blockchain in a project in the traditional financial market at scale, it is essential to prioritize the speed, security and fees of the given blockchain network. Sui said that other exchanges had made attempts at adopting blockchain technology in other parts of their business strategy, but ATHEX\u2019s committed partnership with Sui places it ahead of the pack in taking action with Web3 tools. While ATHEX may be one of the pioneering stock exchanges implementing blockchain with its EBB tool, other global stock exchanges have been dabbling in the Web3 space, too. Significantly, on March 11, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) declared its intention to consider applications according to the criteria outlined in its Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) during the second quarter of 2024. On March 25, it said that applications for the crypto ETNs could be submitted as soon as April 8, with successful funds to be listed the following month with approval from the country\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority. While not a blockchain integration, the exchange\u2019s openness and Web3-friendly approach could point toward a larger trend in TradFi.

The Bitcoin halving is a milestone event occurring every 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years. The halving event cuts the block reward earned by miners by half. Apart from indirectly impacting the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the halving event significantly impacts miner behavior, as mining costs double to earn the same amount of BTC. After the May 2020 halving, the price for miners to continue mining profitably rose above $30,000, but the price of BTC also pumped to a new all-time high of $69,000 during the same cycle. The average Bitcoin mining cost as of April 6 is $49,902, and the BTC price is above $70,000 at the time of writing. After the halving on April 20, average mining costs will rise above $80,000, and for miners to continue operating profitably, the BTC price must trade higher than that price. Historically, BTC prices have seen a multifold jump in price after the halving. Following the 2012 halving, the price of Bitcoin increased by around 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the price of Bitcoin increased by about 4,200% to $19,800, and after the 2020 halving, the price of Bitcoin increased by almost 683% to $69,000. Related: Bitcoin halving will have to battle with \u2018weak time of year\u2019 \u2014 Coinbase Thus, miners have remained profitable despite fears of going out of business after each halving. Halving events also make several mining machines obsolete, as they can\u2019t compete with the high hashing power demand. After each halving, there comes a period when the BTC price remains below the miner\u2019s profitable price. This period is marred by uncertainty and an increased selling of mining rigs, coupled with many small and lone miners often going out of business. However, as demand increases due to the declining market supply, the price picks up and often rises higher than the average mining costs for miners.

The largest cryptocurrency, which spent the weekend grinding higher, is capitalizing on its gains to move ever closer to all-time highs. Ahead of the first Wall Street open, anticipation for further upside is already tangible in trading circles \u2014 can BTC price momentum deliver? There is certainly a sense of deja vu in crypto this week \u2014 the result of pent-up excitement following several weeks of corrective moves. Volatility, both up and down, could well continue, however. Bitcoin\u2019s next block subsidy halving is just 10 days away, and miners are in the final stages of preparation for the reward per block to drop 50% overnight. Network fundamentals are thus key to keep an eye on going forward, with difficulty set for new record highs this week. Elsewhere, macroeconomic sentiment is cool as markets price out the odds of a swift interest rate cut from the United States Federal Reserve. Cointelegraph examines these issues and more in its weekly rundown of key BTC price topics to monitor in the coming days. Bitcoin is wasting no time in attempting to claw back the final lost ground below all-time highs this week. The weekly close, which came in at around $69,000, followed an uncharacteristic weekend during which BTC/USD slowly edged higher despite the absence of institutional players. The real move came afterward, however, with the Asia trading session witnessing sudden upside volatility, which at the time of writing had peaked at $72,573 on Bitstamp. Bitcoin was thus up 2.5% on the day already, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. \u201cSpot BTC buyers are hungry,\u201d financial commentator Tedtalksmacro summarized in a post on X. An accompanying chart showed spot buyers leading derivatives on the move higher. These spot flows are key for several well-known market observers when it comes to bullish momentum sustaining. For popular trader Skew, $70,000 hinged on continued interest. \u201cVolatility remains moderate into HTF picture meaning price swings of $2K are to be expected,\u201d he commented on a chart showing the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator. \u201cGetting closer to band squeeze territory if price compression occurs into late monday. Still need to see increasing buy volume & spot flows this week to sustain above $70K, at least in the near term.\u201d Others on the day saw the potential for a fresh retracement. For fellow trader Crypto Ed, a \u201cvery obvious\u201d pennant structure now in place on daily timeframes could offer a trip back to $68,000 before fresh highs. \u201cIf we do get that pull back and print another higher low, load up for a move towards $80,000,\u201d he told X followers. Also on the radar were two nearby \u201cgaps\u201d in CME Group\u2019s Bitcoin futures market, with both appearing as the price moved during weekends, now at around $64,000 and $68,500. \u201cThey tend to become kind of self fulfilling prophecies if enough people are watching them and act on it which makes price close the gaps,\u201d trader Daan Crypto Trades warned alongside an illustrative chart. \u201cThe moment price trades further away, and people stop caring, is usually when it loses most of its value.\u201d Another key week of U.S. macroeconomic data is due, potentially reinforcing the Fed\u2019s views on rate cuts. While Bitcoiners are mostly focused on the halving, both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) prints for March will come in the next few days. The U.S. inflation narrative currently contrasts with signals from Europe. In recent speeches, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that officials feel at ease with a data-driven approach to rate cuts, with inflation slowly ebbing and the economy withstanding the impact of tighter policy. Markets have thus pushed back their expectations of when these might begin to close to the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s all about inflation data and the Fed\u2019s next steps this week,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of its weekly diary on X. The latest estimates from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool show the odds of a 0.25% cut in either June or July at under 50%. At the same time, however, Europe and the United Kingdom are increasingly looking to cut rates sooner. \u201cWe are not yet at the point where we can cut interest rates, but things are moving to the right direction,\u201d Andrew Bailey, chair of the Bank of England, said in March. It\u2019s Bitcoin halving season, and attention is increasingly focusing on miner preparations. There are under two weeks until the amount of \u201cnew\u201d Bitcoin unlocked per mined block decreases by 50% to 3.125 BTC. Miners have upped selling in 2024, and now, analysts see a period of adjustment ahead. \u201cBitcoin mining costs are set to double by the end of the month after the halving, jumping from $40K to $80K for S19 XPs, commonly utilized by US miners,\u201d Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, revealed this week. Ki noted that mining costs are already double what they were in 2020, but BTC price gains had mitigated the impact on miners\u2019 bottom line. \u201cSince the May 2020 halving, mining costs doubled, yet a parabolic bull run ensued, covering these costs and achieving profitability,\u201d he added. A lack of further upside now could thus take its toll on smaller participants with less leeway for fluctuating market forces. As Cointelegraph reported, however, some see revenue flows being preserved after the halving thanks to the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and increasing fees. \u201cIn dollar terms, it\u2019s not obvious that miners would be worse off after the halving, quite the opposite,\u201d Laurent Benayoun, the CEO of crypto adviser and market maker Acheron Trading, said in an interview last week. As such, Bitcoin network fundamentals approach the halving looking stronger than ever. Mining difficulty, already near all-time highs, is due to increase by approximately 2% on April 11 to pass 85 trillion for the first time. Despite nearly a month of consolidatory BTC price action, data from monitoring resource BTC.com also shows that difficulty ultimately decreased by less than 1%. The mining hash rate tells a similar story. Raw data from MiningPoolStats now puts the total processing power deployment to the network at 684 exahashes per second (EH/s). Output from known mining pools is practically at the highest ever seen, the numbers show. As Cointelegraph reported, preparations for the halving have come from various sources. Among them was a declaration of intent to increase mining output sixfold before the event by Bitdeer Technologies, the Bitcoin mining partner of the Kingdom of Bhutan. Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin\u2019s long-term holders (LTHs) had become increasingly active sellers at current prices. Related: Bitcoin absorbs $100M+ \u2018sell-side days\u2019 as bears lose BTC price clout Older coins are also moving on-chain as LTHs\u2019 spent output profit ratio (SOPR) swings more in their favor. For Checkmate, a lead on-chain analyst at crypto analytics firm Glassnode, however, this is perfectly normal and should not result in sell-side pressure overcoming the market. \u201cThis Bitcoin ATH break looks like just about every previous ATH break,\u201d he suggested about the recent trip to $73,800. \u201cLong-Term Holders start to spend their coins, taking advantage of the new inflowing demand and liquidity. Smart money folks who buy low and sell high.\u201d An accompanying chart from his own statistics platform, Checkonchain, examined the spending habits of various coin cohorts over time. So far, Checkmate argued, history is simply repeating itself. LTH entities tend to shed around 14% of the BTC supply under their control in bull markets, and so far, less than half of this has left their wallets. \u201cIn the prior two cycles, new demand for Bitcoin was able to absorb this LTH sell-side for around 6-8 months, whilst also pushing prices multiples higher,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we consider the typical LTH Supply drawdown of -14%, we\u2019re around 40% of the way through this process (ballpark only).\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

By analyzing how these frauds work and offering a range of strong safeguards, Cointelegraph provides readers with the knowledge and resources they need to protect their investments in the quickly changing cryptocurrency market. With the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrencies, exit scams have become a serious menace that takes advantage of the industry\u2019s inventiveness for malicious purposes. Scams that cause project creators to vanish suddenly after receiving large sums of money harm the credibility of the digital currency industry. Hackers use blockchain technology\u2019s anonymity to their advantage by luring unsuspecting investors with promises of huge profits and groundbreaking breakthroughs. After receiving investor money, these con artists disappear, leaving a legacy of depleted trust and financial disaster in their wake. Understanding the mechanisms, incentives and expressions of cryptocurrency exit scams is imperative for individuals traversing this contemporary financial landscape. An exit scam is like a well-rehearsed play. It consists of multiple acts meant to create suspense and trust. Scammers first spend money putting up a lavish front with a reliable website, extensive marketing plans and enticing sneak peeks at their supposedly ground-breaking technologies. This phase is essential for con artists to attract investors and build a solid reputation. When interest surges, the scammers divert their attention to gathering money through direct donations, private sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs) \u2014 all while offering early supporters special privileges and large returns. The temptation of large profits combined with convincing marketing forces investors to give up their money, accelerating the scam\u2019s growth. In November 2017, Confido, a blockchain startup aiming to revolutionize traditional escrow services, vanished after raising $375,000 in an ICO. This incident highlights the risks associated with ICOs, where investors often entrust funds to unregulated startups with little oversight. The dramatic exit of the fraudsters from the project occurs in the last act. Investments drain, communication links close, websites go black, and project progress and promised profits disappear, leaving investors reeling from financial loss. The psychological manipulation that exit scammers use to trick investors into falling into their trap relies heavily on their ability to take advantage of basic cognitive biases and emotional triggers. To trick investors, crooks in the cryptocurrency realm effectively take advantage of human nature. They employ the bandwagon effect to provide the impression that their ideas are well-liked and have extensive support, which helps them look like smart investments. This deceptive strategy exploits our innate desire to follow the herd. Furthermore, they create a false sense of urgency and scarcity by inundating prospective investors with ads emphasizing the brief opportunity to join, pressuring them to make rash and frequently disastrous investment decisions. Another trick they play is to create the appearance of authority by forging certifications and recommendations from well-known personalities in the cryptocurrency space to give their schemes unjustified legitimacy. In the end, they feed off the instinctive feelings of fear and greed. The desire for excessive profits combined with the fear of losing out on something marketed as a once-in-a-lifetime chance causes investors to act against their better judgment. These strategies highlight the intricate psychological deception used in cryptocurrency exit scams. To successfully navigate the dangerous waters of cryptocurrency investing, one must be alert and able to recognize the telltale signals of possible exit scams. Projects that primarily rely on marketing buzz tend to overcompensate for a lack of solid technology or products in the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies, which raises red flags for potential investors. Immediately raising doubts about validity is a conspicuous lack of verifiable information about partnerships, team members or the present status of project development. Furthermore, thoroughly analyzing a project\u2019s tokenomics can highlight irregularities or unviable procedures that point to fraud risk. Reputable businesses usually respect the autonomy of their investors, enabling careful evaluation of all relevant data without using coercive methods like bonuses or time-sensitive offers to compel funding. On the other hand, initiatives that use these techniques reveal a preference for manipulation over quality. Furthermore, the community\u2019s opinion \u2014 as distilled through forums, social media and independent review sites \u2014 is a useful indicator of a project\u2019s legitimacy. Comments from these sources can reveal information about a project\u2019s standing, offering an essential extra degree of research for people sifting through the world of cryptocurrency investments. Robust technology defenses must be investors\u2019 first priority to combat the threat of crypto exit scams. Smart contract audits are crucial; only fund projects whose code has been thoroughly inspected by reputed firms. Use blockchain explorers and monitoring software to oversee unusual real-time wallet activity and transaction patterns. To lessen the likelihood of anonymous fraudsters, prioritize projects with verified team identities since transparency is essential. By actively exchanging knowledge, contributing to peer-reviewed databases and participating in open conversations on decentralized forums, investors may harness the strength of the cryptocurrency community. Pursuing continuous education and learning about the common scam tactics through case studies, educational materials and best practices are still critical. Furthermore, proactive engagement with regulators can shape a safer investment landscape. Advocate for using RegTech solutions designed to increase transparency and streamline compliance. By combining technological vigilance, community collaboration, ongoing education and a willingness to work with regulatory bodies, investors can confidently navigate the cryptocurrency world and mitigate the dangers of exit scams.","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #Adoption, #Scams, #How to"},{"date":"Apr 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ezra Reguerra","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/binance-ban-philippines-sec-fund-retrieval-investors","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Philippines SEC \u2018can\u2019t endorse\u2019 ways to retrieve funds after Binance ban","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"In a local news report, Paolo Ong, the officer in charge of the SEC\u2019s PhiliFintech Innovation Office, said that the SEC couldn\u2019t endorse ways to retrieve funds after Binance is blocked by internet service providers (ISP) in the country.

The official hoped that investors would have already transferred their funds to either a local exchange or their wallets within the specified time frame. When queried about the fate of users unable to withdraw their funds in time, Ong stated that they do not have any suggested means for users to reclaim their money. He said: \u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t endorse any method on how to take out their money now that the blocking order is out.\u201c On March 25, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) ordered internet service providers (ISPs) in the country to immediately block access to Binance.

TON Society, a community of developers and contributors building out the TON ecosystem, will distribute one million Toncoin to users participating in the voluntary proof-of-personhood program. The project aims to enable digital identity verification for Telegram users over the next five years. The project uses HumanCode\u2019s technology to allow users to verify their human identity on the blockchain. The application, available on Google Play and Apple Store, lets users scan their palms on a smartphone. According to information shared with Cointelegraph, the technology provides privacy protection and is hardware-agnostic, allowing the scanner to be used on various mobile devices. TON Foundation growth director Ekin Tuna said that supporting proof-of-personhood protocols like HumanCode is a step toward a practical reputation system with real-life use cases for TON\u2019s ecosystem: \u201cA scalable, private, and decentralized identity will help to onboard the first one billion users to the Web3 ecosystem in Telegram.\u201d HumanCode founder Tim Zhang told Cointelegraph that the technology securely scans a human palm by extracting the pattern directly onto a user's smartphone device. \u201cThis local extraction ensures the pattern is non-reversible, meaning that even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to our server, reconstructing the palm images from the patterns would be impossible,\u201d Zhang explains. The founder added that the system maintains U.S. SOC2 data security and privacy certifications and implements a triple-layer privacy protection mechanism. The first step involves local extraction of the user\u2019s unique palm pattern, preventing personal information from being transferred off the device. The extracted feature is encrypted before being sent to HumanCode servers to secure the data during transmission. The verification process is conducted locally on a user\u2019s device, removing the need to transfer sensitive data to external servers. HumanCode incentives will be given to TON Society members who complete a palm scan and prove their personhood. A \u2018soulbound' token is then minted to represent their verified digital identity before users are rewarded for participating. Cointelegraph also highlighted the reality of increased skepticism for proof-of-personhood technology in conversation with Zhang, given that Worldcoin has received pushback for its iris-scanning technology. The company\u2019s iris-scanning devices and data collection methods have been subject to investigations and regulatory scrutiny in Hong Kong, Spain and France over the past six months. Zhang said HumanCode\u2019s use of robust security protocols and encryption is an important trust-bridging factor, while suggesting that users might feel less intimidated about scanning their hands instead of their eyes: \u201cFrom our experience, palm recognition technology is inherently more acceptable. For most people, scanning your palm with a smartphone camera just feels less intrusive than eye-scanning.\u201d Zhang also said the technology can potentially combat bots and fraudulent accounts on any social media platform by verifying the authenticity of users through unique palm patterns. This allows a platform to effectively distinguish between real users and automated bots. In March, the TON Foundation allocated 30 million Toncoin, worth around $115 million, for various community rewards to drive adoption. The incentives are allocated to four different areas: $38 million worth of TON will go to token mining and user incentives, $22 million for airdrops, $15 million for the League developer ecosystem, and $40 million for liquidity pool boosts. The Telegram Ad Platform, built on the TON blockchain, officially went live in March 2024. The platform allows Telegram channel owners worldwide to receive financial rewards, exclusively selling advertising and sharing revenue with channel owners in TON.

While a swift rollback prevented a potential $3.4 million loss, roughly $864,000 of assets were lost in the process. ParaSwap collaborated closely with blockchain analytics and security firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs to identify the hacker addresses and trace the movement of the funds. The foundation said: \u201cThe (ParaSwap) Foundation will cover the remaining costs linked to the vulnerability, including the refunds, the engagement of security analysts, conducting thorough contract re-audits, communication with authorities, and the formulation and execution of the refund process.\u201d On April 4, ParaSwap announced the recovery of roughly $500,000 worth of assets. \u201cThanks to this rescue, the amount of funds still unaccounted for \u2014 which comprise users drained after depositing to a still compromised account \u2014 has been reduced by 63%,\u201d it said. According to ParaSwap, providing full refunds to affected users is a step toward the project\u2019s long-term sustainability.

Further investigations revealed that the phishing advertisements appearing on Etherscan were also displayed on various known phishing websites. Picking up on McBiblets\u2019 lead, Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer found that the phishing advertisements spread beyond Etherscan and were showing up on popular search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, as well as social media platform X. Scam Sniffer suspected the lack of oversight from advertisement aggregators as the root cause of the large-scale phishing campaign: \u201cEtherscan aggregates ads from platforms like Coinzilla and Persona, where insufficient filtering could lead to exposure to phishing attempts.\u201d The wallet drainer scam involves luring users to fake websites and prompting them to link their crypto wallets. Once linked, the scammer can withdraw funds into their personal wallet addresses without user authentication or permission.

Santiment speculated that it is a \u201clikely foregone conclusion\u201d that the high ETF activity will continue leading up to the Bitcoin halving in around two weeks. The Bitcoin halving event, which happens every four years, is estimated to occur on April 20. According to Santiment, there has been $3.19 billion daily volume among the top seven ETFs. However, \u201cit will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterward,\u201d it added. Lucas Kiely of Yield App recently suggested that the accumulation of Bitcoin via ETFs could reduce the likelihood of large swings after the halving. Spot Bitcoin ETF volumes soared to $111 billion in March, almost tripling the volume for the previous month, highlighting consistent interest in the products. According to Farside Investors, Bitcoin ETF inflows picked up at the end of last week, with two days of more than $200 million in net inflow on April 4 and 5. That followed a couple of low days earlier in the week with an $85.7 million outflow on April 1 in what appeared to be a trend reversal from a strong few days in late March. Grayscale continues to drag the aggregate figures down with consistent outflows every trading day since it converted to a spot ETF in mid-January.

We also have the best community,\u201d he added in response to \u201call the dunking on Cardano.\u201d Hoskinson\u2019s optimism was fueled mainly by the upcoming Chang hard fork, seen as one of the network\u2019s biggest hard forks since the 2022 Vasil upgrade and slated for the second quarter of this year. Chang is the first hard fork of the Voltaire era of Cardano\u2019s roadmap, which will introduce the concept of community-run governance to the blockchain by enabling on-chain community consensus and allowing Cardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) holders to use their tokens to vote on proposals. It\u2019s seen as enabling the network to become fully decentralized by introducing community governance. \u201cChang is coming soon as measured by progress on SanchoNet.\u201d Throughout the rest of this year, the transition will introduce Delegate Representatives (DReps), involve a Cardano Constitution Convention event, and a Cardano community vote to ratify the first draft of the Cardano Constitution. \u201cOuroboros Leios is the biggest step forward toward solving the blockchain trilemma ever,\u201d Hoskinson added. Ouroboros Leios is a new version of the proof-of-stake consensus model designed to increase throughput, scalability and transaction speed on Cardano while maintaining the current level of decentralization. Hoskinson\u2019s comments came in response to an April 7 video from Ben Armstrong \u2014 aka BitBoy \u2014 who was contemplating whether Cardano was \u201cdead.\u201d He compared Cardano to Solana, Sui and Toncoin, which were \u201cblowing up\u201d and \u201ckilling it\u201d in terms of users, activity and price action, whereas the numbers for Cardano were \u201cnot fantastic.\u201d Hoskinson argued that the crypto industry has a problem with short-term narratives. \u201cThe problem with our industry is that we let short-term narratives and carnival barkers dominate the conversation.

Several analysts expect the next trigger to be Bitcoin halving. However, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase cautions that Bitcoin\u2019s price action could face hurdles after the halving event as the period is typically a weak time of the year for crypto markets and other risk assets. While the upside looks open, the downside may be limited. UTXO Management senior analyst Dylan LeClair believes that even in case of a fall, Bitcoin is unlikely to dip to $50,000 where a large cluster of longs risk being taken out. However, he warned that nothing is impossible in the crypto markets. Although Bitcoin has been leading the markets higher, several altcoins have been huge outperformers. Pantera Capital\u2019s Liquid Token Fund said in a shareholder letter reviewed by Bloomberg that the fund trimmed exposure to Bitcoin and Ether and increased allocations to DeFi tokens, which helped it post 66% returns in the first quarter of 2024. Will select altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin in the near term? Let\u2019s study the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. Bitcoin has been oscillating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern for the past few days, signaling indecision about the next directional move. The 20-day exponential moving average ($68,049) continues to move up gradually, and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicates a slight edge for the bulls. A break and close above the triangle will suggest that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the buyers. The BTC/USDT pair could rise to $73,777 and eventually to $80,000. Instead, if the price turns lower from the downtrend line and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears on a break below the triangle. That could start a decline to $59,000 and then to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. The 20-EMA has started to turn up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. The up move is likely to face stiff resistance at the downtrend line, but if bulls overcome this barrier, the consolidation phase may be over. The pair could rise to $72,000 and subsequently to $73,777, Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are not willing to give up. The pair may then slip to the support line of the triangle. Sellers will have to yank the price below this level to signal the start of a downward move to $59,000. Toncoin (TON) has been gradually inching higher toward the overhead resistance of $5.69, signaling that the bulls are attempting to regain control. Although the upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.86) indicates an advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that a consolidation or correction is possible in the near term. If the price turns down from the current level or $5.69, it will signal that the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. On the other hand, if buyers pierce the $5.69 resistance, the TON/USDT pair may start the next leg of the uptrend toward $7.09. The 4-hour chart shows that the price has been swinging between $5.60 and $4.72 for a while. The moving averages have started to turn up gradually, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. This enhances the prospects of a break above $5.69. If that happens, the pair may climb to $6.48. Contrarily, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for some more time. The bears will gain the upper hand on a slump below $4.72. Stacks (STX) has corrected in an uptrend. The price has been stuck between the moving averages, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the price rises above $3.36, it will signal that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That will increase the possibility of a rally to the overhead resistance of $3.84. If this level is cleared, the STX/USDT pair could rise to $4.27 and later to $5. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That may start a deeper pullback to $2.50 and subsequently to $2.20. The bulls have pushed the price above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers maintain the momentum and drive the price above the 50-SMA, the pair could attempt a rally to $3.60 and later to $3.84. Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. A break below $3.05 will strengthen the bears, and the selling is likely to accelerate below $2.90. Related: Terra founder Do Kwon released in Montenegro Mantle (MNT) has been facing resistance at $1.50, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.18). The bulls will again try to retest the overhead resistance of $1.50. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers overcome the barrier at $1.50, the MNT/USDT pair could start a rally toward $1.90. On the contrary, if the price turns down from $1.50, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. The pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support will signal the start of a deeper correction. Both moving averages are gradually sloping higher on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers remain in control. There is a minor resistance at $1.45, but if that level is crossed, the pair may climb to $1.50. The 50-SMA remains the key support to watch on the downside. A break below this support will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair could then drop to the strong support near $1.15. The bulls are finding it difficult to sustain Maker (MKR) above $4,000 level, resulting in profit-booking. The MKR/USDT pair could correct to the 20-day EMA ($3,481), an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. The pair could then retest the overhead resistance of $4,074. If this level is scaled, the pair may pick up momentum and jump to $5,280. Contrarily, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($2,794). The pair has dipped below the moving averages on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge. The pair could slide to $3,561 and next to $3,453 where the bulls will try to arrest the fall. If the price rebounds off the support, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate for some time. On the contrary, a break below $3,453 could start a correction to $3,000 and next to $2,700. The uptrend is likely to resume on a close above $4,074.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev told their 440,000 followers on X that Bitcoin had closed two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger Band, adding that every time Bitcoin had done this in the past, its price had doubled within the next three months. This would put Bitcoin at around $140,000 by July. In technical analysis, Bollinger Bands are a tool that measures the momentum and volatility of an asset within a certain range. Typically, when prices touch the upper band, it can indicate an overbought signal, while touching the lower band indicates an asset being oversold. However, Bollinger Bands are just one of many technical indicators available to analysts, and according to Investopedia, they are more reactive than predictive, given their use of past price action and volatility data. The metrics can also differ widely during peak bull and bear markets. Meanwhile, SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci took to CNBC on April 6 to predict that Bitcoin could reach as high as $170,000 during the cycle and could eventually trade at around half the total value of the global gold market. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying it could trade to half the valuation of gold, which is around six to eight to 10 times move from here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight, and there will be a lot of volatility,\u201d he added. Bitcoin currently commands a market capitalization of $1.35 trillion, while gold boasts a total value of $15.8 trillion. If Bitcoin were to trade at half the value of gold, its market cap would need to grow roughly six times from here, which would result in a price of roughly $400,000 per BTC. #Bitcoin is up over 140% over the last year, hitting all-time highs last month fueled by demand from spot ETFs. @Scaramucci discusses why he thinks Bitcoin is back: pic.twitter.com/HJxQEy6XY0 \u2014 CNBC's Closing Bell (@CNBCClosingBell) April 5, 2024 Describing the 10 recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as \u201cselling machines,\u201d Scaramucci argued these products would continue to spur increased retail and institutional demand for the crypto asset. Nine of the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs have now seen over $12 billion worth of net inflows, with Grayscale being the odd one out. In contrast, when the Gold ETF (GLD) was launched in November 2004, it took nearly one year to notch $10 billion in inflows. Like many other market commentators, Scaramucci viewed the upcoming Bitcoin halving \u2014 currently scheduled for April 20 \u2014 as a major catalyst for Bitcoin price appreciation in the short term. The optimism also wasn\u2019t lost on Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who predicts that the value of the entire crypto sector would double by the end of this year. In an April 7 report from CNBC, Garlinghouse predicted that the entire crypto sector would be worth $5 trillion by the end of the year, looking to the upcoming halving, regulatory developments and the increasing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs as having a continued positive effect on wider crypto adoption.

Indeed, we have just a couple of weeks left before the big event. So it\u2019s no surprise that the halving is all crypto investors and media can talk about right now. But while we can still expect some predictable trading behavior in the wake of the big day, we\u2019re now in a very different market that calls for different trading strategies. Over the past three cycles, the halving has been all about the huge spike in volatility. We would typically expect a sell-off of 30%-40%, followed by a stratospheric rise to a new all-time high within, on average, 480 days of the halving date. This time, though, the spot Bitcoin ETF has changed everything. To understand where the price of Bitcoin is going from here, it is the asset\u2019s volatility that we need to look at more closely. Over recent months, we have seen the anticipated drawdowns as pre-halving excitement builds. Yet these drawdowns have been anemic by previous cycles\u2019 standards. This time, Bitcoin\u2019s corrections have been far shallower, not exceeding 25%. Indeed, the latest drawdown was only around 15% before BTC bounced back once again toward the $70,000 mark. Related: Bitcoin maxis are about to kick off the altseason as BTC turns institutional This more muted sell-off is a harbinger of a softer rally once we\u2019re over the halving hump. There\u2019s little doubt that Bitcoin will see the customary sell-off following the halving, and it will certainly reach a new all-time high after. Equally, returns will still look a lot more exciting than they do for, say, traditional equity holders. But don\u2019t expect the more than 600% price increases we saw after the last halving in 2020. Those days are over. So why is this happening? There are two factors at play here. Firstly, the percentage of long-term Bitcoin holders has reached a record of around 14 million BTC \u2014 more than 70% of the total circulating supply of 19,670,043 BTC. Over recent months, record amounts of BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges to cold wallets as more and more holders adopt a \u201cdiamond hands\u201d approach. But what really has led to a pronounced shift in behavior is the arrival of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Today, ETFs are hoovering up more BTC supply from the market than miners can supply. On average, spot BTC ETFs have taken in roughly 10,000 BTC per day since launch, while miners are only generating 900 new BTC every day. This is exacerbating scarcity and leading to upward price action. Related: Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility Crucially, though, this also means a drastic drop in long-term volatility because ETF investors are fall more long-term minded than the average crypto trader. Though we\u2019ve seen a spike in volatility recently as we approach the halving event, it remains well below levels we\u2019ve witnessed during previous halvings. CoinGlass data shows that the 30-day historical BTC/USD volatility has dropped from a high of nearly 18% in April 2013 to around 4% at the time of writing. You\u2019d expect to see this percentage on a U.S. equity fund factsheet, not a cryptocurrency price chart. This is because the investors coming into the spot Bitcoin ETFs now are those same mom-and-pop investors and institutions who have poured trillions into S&P 500 ETFs. They are long-term holders for whom three years is the minimum investment term, and their decisions to buy or sell an investment are dictated by long-term drivers, like macroeconomic conditions, structural market changes, and long-term return potential. So what does this mean for investors hoping to profit from the halving? They\u2019ll have to think a lot more like the traditional equity investor than the crypto degen. They\u2019ll have to swap Messari for Morningstar (a global provider of data on traditional funds) to gauge the ebbs and flows of spot Bitcoin ETF assets under management. They\u2019ll have to keep one eye firmly fixed on what long-term holders are doing, because they are now the ones in the driving seat. And if they want those 600% returns, they\u2019ll have to look elsewhere. That\u2019s not what we\u2019ll see after this Bitcoin halving. The trade-off, though, will be steadier, more reliable returns that won\u2019t skew the volatility profile of a typical balanced portfolio out of all proportion. And for most investors, this is a much more appealing prospect than an asset that has a 50/50 chance of going to the moon or disappearing completely.

The proposal passed on April 6 with 91.7% of votes in favor, allowing tokens from the community treasury worth over $61 million at current prices to be staked with liquid staking protocol Stride. According to dYdX, the move is a response to the growing trading activity on the protocol: \u201cThe rate of DYDX being staked to validators has plateaued and deposits to the exchange are growing at a tremendous pace. Over $140M USDC is held in dYdX v4, of which roughly $100M arrived in the past week.\u201d Staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency to support a blockchain network\u2019s operations, like processing transactions or validating new blocks. Participants, or \u201cstakers,\u201d commit their tokens as stakes in the network. In return for their service and the risks\u2014such as potential token value fluctuation \u2014 stakers receive rewards, often in the form of additional tokens. By staking its native tokens, the DEX is seeking to shield its network from a possible control attack, similar to a 51% attack. This type of attack happens when a malicious entity gains control over a significant amount of a blockchain\u2019s hashing power, enabling the network to be manipulated. Decentralizing voting power prevents such attacks from occurring. dYdX noted that its network architecture enables a scenario where an attacker, with just one-third of the voting power, could pause on-chain operations. Additionally, possessing two-thirds of the voting power could allow such actors to potentially misuse the funds of users and the community within the dYdX Chain. \u201cSince the voting power today is $456M, a malicious actor must contribute at least $912M in staked DYDX to take control of the protocol, which would allow them to exploit user deposits and community assets. This sounds like a lot today, but it isn\u2019t such a high barrier when we factor in that only 11.5% of the total supply of DYDX are staked.\u201d Staking rewards on dYdX accrue in the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) and are generated from the fees users pay to trade on the protocol. Stride\u2019s mechanism allows DYDX stakes to increase automatically over time as rewards are recompounded. For the staking service, the dYdX community will pay a 7.5% fee on the staked position. Data from DefiLlama shows dYdX total value locked on-chain at $504.48 at the time of writing. The network generated over $48.59 million in fees over the past twelve months.

From virtual reality (VR) to augmented reality (AR), the metaverse offers it all. However, the hype has fallen short after only three years, with the metaverse failing to retain the attention of the business world. Defined as a collectively shared virtual space where users can interact, socialize and engage in various activities, the metaverse captured the imagination of technology enthusiasts, investors and futurists alike. Amid the hype and excitement surrounding the metaverse, financial investments have been substantial, with tech giants like Disney and Meta (formerly known as Facebook) investing heavily to dominate the space. However, today, the metaverse has failed to reach its potential. As tech journalist Ed Zitron stated in Business Insider, \u201cThe metaverse, the once-buzzy technology that promised to allow users to hang out awkwardly in a disorientating video-game-like world, has died after being abandoned by the business world. It was three years old.\u201d While the demise is evident, it was foreseen from a mile away. One piece of evidence of the demise of the metaverse, as Zitron put it, was the money Meta lost with its metaverse investments. Reality Labs, Meta\u2019s virtual and augmented reality research arm, was the most aggressive investor in the field. Since its establishment in 2019, Reality Labs has lost $46.5 billion in metaverse investments. As a result of these losses, Meta reportedly stopped pitching its metaverse to its advisers. Disney\u2019s restructuring under returning chief executive Bob Chapek saw the metaverse division laid off in 2023, just over a year after its formation, to eliminate $5.5 billion in costs. The story of VR as we know it today started in 1968, when Ivan Sutherland presented the first head-worn augmented reality display. Gaming companies adopted and developed the idea in the 1980s and 1990s. Established in 2012, Oculus Rift launched a high-quality VR headset for gaming, attracting significant attention to the product and the company itself. In 2014, Facebook acquired Oculus Rift for $2 billion. The purchase was seven years before Facebook renamed itself Meta, which sparked the metaverse hype. Meta wasn\u2019t alone in its trajectory, either. As part of its belief in the metaverse\u2019s potential, the industry predicted the need for tools that could enhance the metaverse experience for its users. Recent: Dead metaverse? Public administration breathes new life into virtual tech In the quest to materialize the metaverse, VR and AR technologies saw significant progress during the boom. They aimed to offer immersive experiences and blur the lines between physical and digital realities. Meta has invested heavily in both its metaverse and VR technology. While it has been losing a substantial amount in the metaverse field, its VR investments have performed better in comparison. In 2023, Meta released its VR headset, the Meta Quest 3, sold for $499. One of its main competitors, Apple, also released its headset, Apple Vision Pro, in 2023, which is priced at $3,499. According to Fortune Business Insights\u2019 VR \u201cMarket Research Report\u201d from June 2023, the United States VR market was worth $19.44 billion in 2022, with the potential for significant growth by 2030. There is also significant demand for VR products on the consumer side. A recent survey by KPMG revealed that 61% of adults in the U.S. are willing to pay $200 or more for devices like VR headsets that are used with the metaverse. Moreover, VR\u2019s benefits go beyond the metaverse and gaming, covering a wide range of areas, including healthcare and education. John Robb, owner of Global Guerrillas Report \u2014 a newsletter platform about technology trends \u2014 was able to foresee VR\u2019s success as early as 2022, which was during the middle of the metaverse boom. Claiming the future would be VR-dominated, Robb said, \u201c2040 will feature an AR/VR mix, but it will mostly be AR, with applications applying digital overlays on existing reality. This will roll out as fast as smartphones did, but with many times the impact. It will be central to the work and private life of 3 billion-plus people by 2040. By then a half a billion people will be earning a living from working, selling, etc., in this environment.\u201d VR technology, which was developed as a mere tool for the metaverse, is not accompanying its mothership in its downfall. Instead, VR shows great potential for transformative experiences. Innovators and developers are still actively pushing boundaries, using VR and AR to boost productivity, foster creativity and revolutionize collaboration. Miguel Palencia, founder of Moonland Meta \u2014 a Web3 gaming metaverse launching in 2024 \u2014 told Cointelegraph that 40 years ago, people thought the video game industry was dead, until \u201ca few smart companies invested in quality products.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the metaverse concept is dead at all, it\u2019s just waiting for the right team and the right product to come along and define the generic \u2018seal of quality.\u2019 This should, in turn, lead legacy game studios to start bringing their IP to the industry.\u201d However, this new standard for quality metaverses could take a long time to develop, according to Andrey Baral, chief business development officer of CLS Global. Recent: Crypto bull run ignites surge in job listings, salary increases He told Cointelegraph, \u201cI think that the future of metaverses is bright, however not in the near future. [...] We have multiple very interesting metaverses with a growing number of users; however, ideally, it will take about a generation to transition.\u201d A hybrid application of VR and the metaverse looks promising, especially in work settings. With the rise of remote and flexible work arrangements, the metaverse offers new possibilities for collaboration and productivity. Whether through virtual offices like Gather or simply team meetings hosted using applications like Google Meet, VR has allowed teams to connect and collaborate regardless of geographical boundaries.","tags":"#Adoption, #Virtual Reality, #Virtual Property, #Metaverse, #Meta, #Virtual Land"},{"date":"Apr 07, 2024","summary":"","author":"William Suberg","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-bulls-70k-btc-price-not-typical-weekend","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin bulls nudge at $70K as BTC price sees 'not typical' weekend","type":"Blog","category":"Market Update","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) headed higher into the April 7 weekly close as uncharacteristic weekend BTC price action boosted bulls.

Aave is a crypto lending platform primarily based on Ethereum. It allows borrowers to take out loans in one cryptocurrency and depositing another as collateral. It is governed by holders of the Aave (AAVE) token, who collectively form the Aave DAO. In a prior post on X, Zeller hinted at the possibility of implementing fees for Aave stakers. On March 16, he wrote, \u201cA new iteration of the safety module will suggest distributing fees to stakers.\u201d A \u201cfee switch\u201d typically refers to a feature or mechanism within a system or platform that allows for activating or deactivating specific fees or charges.

If Aave DAO proceeds with fee activation, it will emulate Frax Finance, which recently endorsed a proposal to reintroduce its fee switch. However, on April 5, the AaveDAO discussed Dai (DAI) collateral restrictions. Risk management advisers from Chaos Labs presented a fresh proposal advocating a 12% decrease in Dai loan-to-value ratios (LTV) against Marc Zeller\u2019s proposed 75% reduction.

The move counters MakerDAO\u2019s rapid D3M plan, raising the DAI credit line to about 600 million DAI a month.

The crypto market will need to find another narrative to further push up prices across the board, Coinbase further explained in its April 5 market commentary report. \u201cThe BTC halving, currently due April 20 or 21, could be a catalyst for higher prices, but it will have to contend with what is typically a weak time of year for crypto markets and other risk assets,\u201d the exchange stated. Bitcoin (BTC) has typically seen a monthly return of about 2.7% from June to September since 2011, while in the other eight months, it averaged a return of around 19.3%, according to data from digital assets research firm Brave New Coin. Meanwhile, Coinbase further noted that overall crypto volumes \u201chave also continued to slow as the market tries to find the next narrative to power it higher.\u201d Over the last 24 hours, the total crypto volume was $61.78 billion, a 33.25% decrease from the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, the crypto exchange sees signs pointing toward the likelihood of an increase in new investors entering the crypto market in the near future: \u201cIn our view, bitcoin\u2019s increased acceptance as a form of \u201cdigital gold\u201d could enable demand from a new subset of investors in this market regime.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the overall crypto market is 50.6%, according to CoinStats data, which is the market capitalization of Bitcoin relative to the overall crypto market. Furthermore, the report explained that those awaiting price declines to invest may find the troughs to be less and less as more investors get involved. \u201cAs a result, we think dips are likely to be more aggressively bought compared to previous cycles, even as volatility persists during price discovery,\u201d Coinbase wrote. Halving events have frequently been associated with spikes in the price of Bitcoin. Following the previous halving event in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged. Starting at $8,787 during the halving, the cryptocurrency rallied, reaching nearly $69,000 in November 2021.

Senior analyst at digital asset fund UTXO Management, Dylan LeClair, explained in an analyst note on April 7 that if Bitcoin (BTC) rises back into the $70,000\u2013$75,000 price range, it will put significant pressure on short positions. \u201cAs we\u2019ve consolidated, an increasing amount of short liquidations are building from 70-75k,\u201d he stated. If Bitcoin\u2019s price rises to $70,000, approximately $174.17 million will be liquidated, according to CoinGlass data. Should it reach the upper boundary of LeClair\u2019s range ($75,000), around $830 million worth of short positions would face liquidation. This translates to roughly a 7.8% increase from Bitcoin\u2019s current price of $69,344. Likewise, a similar percentage change of 7.5%, but in a downward movement, occurred on March 15, resulting in $525.2 million in liquidations.

Cointelegraph recently reported that Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen around 658% since the last Bitcoin halving in 2020.

Dogecoin's price rally today mirrors bullish moves across the top-ranking memecoin, as shown below, indicating an increasing risk appetite among traders. The market perceives memecoins as among the most speculative investments within the cryptocurrency sector, primarily due to their minimal underlying value or practical utility. This perspective positions them at the pinnacle of risk, contrasting starkly with traditional safe-haven assets. Simultaneously, the U.S. dollar, traditionally seen as a bastion of stability, is witnessing a depreciation in its value against a consortium of leading foreign currencies, a trend vividly illustrated by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) four-hour chart below. The chart simultaneously reveals an emerging negative correlation between DOGE and the DXY, underscoring that the dollar's weakening is momentarily bolstering the appeal of riskier memecoins, primarily on April 6. Recent data disclosed by Whale Alert reveals that an unidentified wallet address ending in ...wwKF has made a substantial acquisition of 199.27 million DOGE through two transactions within the last 24 hours. The initial transaction saw the wallet purchasing 100 million DOGE, valued at $17.77 million, from Robinhood, followed by a second purchase of 99.27 million coins, equivalent to $17.68 million, from the same platform. These significant moves quickly captured widespread attention, contributing to a swift increase in DOGE\u2019s price. However, there has been a recent decline in the number of entities classified as Dogecoin whales, specifically those holding more than 100,000 and 1 million DOGE, showing notable decreases. It suggests that the market may have overemphasized the significance of the accumulation activities at Robinhood. The period of Dogecoin's price rise has coincided with a sharp decline in its perpetual contracts' open interest (OI) and funding rate. Notably, the number of outstanding contract positions in the market has dropped to $1.38 billion on April 6 from its March 29 peak of $2.21 billion. It implies that traders are closing their positions, possibly due to various reasons such as taking profits, cutting losses, or reducing exposure. Meanwhile, its funding rate stands at 0.0172% as of April 6 \u2014 significantly lower when compared to its recent high of 0.106% on April 1. This situation often arises when fewer traders are willing to take or maintain long positions or when the market expects the price to stabilize or decrease. A falling OI and funding rates alongside rising price typically indicates that the selling pressure is decreasing as traders close their short positions, allowing the price to rise even with reduced trading volume and interest. From a technical perspective, DOGE's price rise today originates from a support confluence at its 200-4H exponential moving average (200-4H EMA; the blue wave) and an ascending trendline \u2014 both at around $0.167. Related: Is Dogecoin copying the 2020 fractal that sent DOGE price soaring 15,800%? The bounce from the support confluence is similar to what DOGE witnessed on March 19, which preceded a 85% rally toward $0.22. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in favor of Coinbase, confirming that secondary sales of cryptocurrencies on its platform do not violate the Securities Exchange Act. The court\u2019s decision affects a nationwide group of people who traded tokens on Coinbase from Oct. 8, 2019, to March 11, 2022. At the heart of the dispute was whether cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase met the criteria for securities. The plaintiffs lodged federal claims under Sections 5, 12(a)(1) and 15 of the Securities Act 1933, alongside Sections 5, 15(a)(1), 20(a) and 29(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They also presented state law claims related to securities legislation in California, Florida and New Jersey, representing a nationwide class of individuals. The plaintiffs contended that Coinbase\u2019s actions amounted to offering and selling unregistered securities. Furthermore, they accused it of violating various provisions of securities laws. However, Coinbase argued that secondary crypto asset sales didn\u2019t meet securities transaction criteria, disputing the relevance of securities regulations. The court examined various aspects, ultimately overturning some of the lower court\u2019s decisions while upholding others. The court determined Coinbase\u2019s potential liability under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act for vending unregistered securities. However, it rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 Securities Exchange Act claims, citing insufficient proof of transaction-specific contracts needed for rescission under Section 29.

Varying language across versions complicated title and privity issues critical to the case. Clarity on the applicable user agreement version was emphasized, with discrepancies hindering a definitive resolution. The plaintiffs view the ruling as a step forward in holding crypto platforms accountable under securities laws, advocating for investor protection in the evolving crypto space. Conversely, Coinbase asserts the decision reinforces its position that secondary crypto sales aren\u2019t securities transactions. Furthermore, Coinbase stressed the necessity of regulatory clarity to foster innovation within the industry. The court\u2019s verdict has substantial consequences for overseeing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal expressed gratitude on X social platform, stating that the court reaffirmed no private liability for secondary trading of digital assets on exchanges like Coinbase under federal securities law, emphasizing the significance of contracts.

Public administration breathes new life into virtual tech","type":"Blog","category":"Analysis","content":"Once hailed as the next frontier of human interaction, the metaverse seemed to lose steam after its initial burst of excitement. Vague promises, unclear financial benefits and costly hardware hampered its mass adoption. But in Germany, a second wave of interest is brewing. State governments and research institutions see the potential of metaverse technologies to revolutionize entertainment, social interaction, public administration and industrial processes. The metaverse is an emerging virtual space built on blockchain, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data, spatial computing and digital twins. It promised to create a new era of connectivity and innovation in many areas, bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms. Will this second chance be different? By focusing on practical applications within public services and industry, Germany aims to understand the true potential of the metaverse. Public administrations and governments could benefit from the metaverse and the integration of their services with the metaverse, according to G√ºnter Wenzel, team leader of the Building Culture Innovation research unit at Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO. The group is currently exploring the potential of metaverse in many areas, particularly in public administration. \u201cWe understand the metaverse as the next evolutionary stage of the internet and the superimposition of real and virtual space, where citizens in the various metaverse ecosystems (commerce, leisure, work, mobility, etc.) would gain open but secure access to data exchange and communication with the authorities through the connection to public administration services,\u201d Wenzel said. Citizens will be able to access these services from anywhere via smartphone, desktop, VR or AR glasses, using cryptographic technology that secures transactions, actions, access rights and role profiles. Recent: Crypto bull run ignites surge in job listings, salary increases According to Wenzel, in this scenario, government agencies will no longer communicate with citizens at a physical counter but rather through the metaverse and will be able to provide the vast majority of services regardless of location. For managing real estate and infrastructure in municipalities or cities, the administration can create a digital twin of a building that can be used to carry out AI-assisted processes for monitoring and maintenance, as well as demolition, conversion and new construction. For Wenzel, it\u2019s still difficult to say whether any of this will make government services more efficient, as it depends on the use case. However, a collaborative initiative of the Ministry of the Interior and Sport in Lower Saxony, the University of M√ºnster and PricewaterhouseCoopers has already showcased the advantages of using immersive technologies in public administration. Over a series of multiday events in 2022, wherein managers and stakeholders formed their quarterly strategies, 11% of participants were more satisfied with workshop outcomes, 16% found that communication had improved, and 58% felt a stronger sense of camaraderie among colleagues. In addition to VR collaboration rooms, the state government of Lower Saxony is also working on another project to test immersive technologies. The new project, \u201cExtended Reality,\u201d aims to explore the potential of extended reality (XR) technologies for public administration services. Lower Saxony is also planning further scientific studies to provide information on the added value of collaboration in VR versus mixed reality (MR) in the context of project work and communication with citizens. These projects are inspired by the strategy on Web4 and virtual worlds adopted by the European Commission on July 11, 2023, to \u201csteer the next technological transition and ensure an open, secure, trustworthy, fair and inclusive digital environment for EU citizens, businesses and public administrations.\u201d A spokesperson for Lower Saxony\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Sport told Cointelegraph that the results of the upcoming projects on extended reality will be fundamental in determining future performance requirements for headsets. \u201cIn the years 2024 and 2025, the focus in Lower Saxony will continue to be on pilot projects for the use of these technologies, as the market is developing very rapidly and, in particular, framework conditions such as full compliance with the GDPR must first be clarified.\u201d Despite the positive statistics, there is still some uncertainty about using immersive technologies in public administration in Lower Saxony. As the spokesperson noted, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge not only the potential but also the limitations and dangers these technologies present. \u201cTheir integration into planning processes requires a careful and thoughtful approach.\u201d Internal risks demand particular attention. Implementing the necessary hardware and software requires robust cybersecurity and data protection. The state government also aims to evaluate the technology\u2019s impact on employee health and data handling practices. Headset availability and suitability pose a further challenge. While the market offers various solutions, not all align with administrative needs, primarily due to the aforementioned security and data concerns. Finally, educating employees and citizens and equipping them with the necessary skills for long-term, sustainable use of immersive technologies is the foundation for successfully harnessing the potential of the metaverse. But it\u2019s also not an easy task. \u201cThe public administration will have to learn which application areas the immersive technologies can best use. Based on this, the government can also support technological development so that an open, secure, trustworthy, fair and inclusive digital environment is guaranteed for citizens, businesses and the public administration.\u201d Lower Saxony and other German state governments are trying to explore metaverse technologies. In 2023, the Fraunhofer-IAO and the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation teamed up with the Virtual Dimension Center (VDC) in Baden-W√ºrttemberg to launch a large-scale metaverse project called CyberL√§nd. Funded by the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labor and Tourism, the initiative focuses on exploring the political, industrial and social potential of the metaverse for the southern German state. Above all, the project team wants to contribute to a deeper understanding of this complex topic: What role will the metaverse play in Baden-W√ºrttemberg? What course of action should the government and businesses take? How can public participation be facilitated? According to CyberL√§nd, the metaverse is an important opportunity for Germany to safeguard its position as a technological powerhouse. In the future, extended reality, software solutions for industry business processes and public services, the virtualization and combination of 3D content and decentralized, interoperable data platforms will have a major role to play. However, building a robust ecosystem requires better collaboration between German industries and their digital technologies. Another positive example of a regional initiative that produces pilot projects focusing on metaverse and AI is the Innovation Park Artificial Intelligence in Heilbronn. The planned Metaverse Lab will offer a variety of educational opportunities and practical use cases for people and companies to learn about and experience the metaverse. The German industrial sector is also realizing the benefits of the metaverse for development and production. Siemens Energy is already using the metaverse to model power plants, predict maintenance needs, and potentially save operators $1.7 billion annually by minimizing downtime. In 2023, Siemens also invested more than $1.1 billion in Germany, half of this amount in a new campus in Erlangen. The campus will serve as a global development and manufacturing center, as well as a hub for technology activities related to the industrial metaverse. In 2024, Siemens also partnered with Sony to create another solution for the industrial metaverse that will combine Siemens\u2019 Xcelerator portfolio of industrial software with Sony\u2019s new system for creating spatial content. The new solution will enable designers and engineers to create and explore design concepts in a boundless, immersive workspace. Similarly, BMW is working on a digital factory powered by Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform, where physical construction will begin only after extensive design and validation of digital models. The metaverse offers a wide range of valuable applications. Germany is experiencing a second wave of interest fueled by a shift toward exploring its practical applications in public administration and industry. Public administration sees the potential for improved citizen engagement, service delivery and collaboration between employees, as demonstrated by early initiatives like VR collaboration rooms in Lower Saxony and the CyberL√§nd project in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Similarly, industry giants like Siemens and BMW leverage the metaverse for enhanced design, testing and production processes. Recent: AI token prices soar: Is it all hype, or is there real potential? Of course, challenges such as data security, legal uncertainties and hardware limitations remain and require careful consideration. Planning, employee training and collaboration between government, industry and researchers are critical to navigating these hurdles successfully, said Wenzel from Fraunhofer-IAO, adding: \u201cStrictly speaking, the metaverse is still a promise for the future, as not all the necessary sub-technologies have reached the required maturity. However, sub-technologies and business models can already be used in smaller bundles and should always be developed and implemented from the perspective of the application case.\u201c","tags":"#Europe, #Adoption, #Germany, #European Union, #Metaverse, #Meta"},{"date":"Apr 06, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/fantom-ceo-defends-solana-amid-network-woes","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Fantom CEO defends Solana amid network woes","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Fantom network creator Andre Cronje has expressed support for the Solana network amid recent transaction failures. Cronje is considered one of the most influential thought leaders in decentralized finance (DeFi). According to a post on X by Cronje, some critics view the ongoing congestion as Solana\u2019s flaw, but it stems from the ecosystem\u2019s rapid growth, which has increased demand for block space. Cronje stated that performance issues are technical challenges, not consensus mechanism flaws. According to Dune Analytics, amid a surge in activity driven by the recent memecoin craze on Solana, approximately 75% of non-vote transactions failed on April 4. Yet, proponents argue the data is widely misunderstood. Cronje referred to the Solana network as a victim of success. The uptick in transaction failures was followed by a recent uproar from Solana users on social media, who complained of failed transactions and a degraded user experience. Meanwhile, other members of the community supported Cronje\u2019s stance, stating that people often laud blockchain technology for its underlying principles and capabilities. However, when increased demand leads to temporary user experience issues, they tend to react negatively despite craving higher usage. Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko expressed frustration, noting that addressing congestion bugs is more challenging than total liveness failure. While the latter requires identification and patching, congestion bugs entail a lengthy testing process and releasing updates, hindering rapid deployment.

In its \u201cBanking in video games and virtual worlds\u201d report released on Thursday, April 4, the consumer protection agency highlights the rising interest among gaming creators in bridging virtual items to reality. Despite still trailing mainstream gaming platforms like Roblox or Fortnite, the agency highlighted the growth of crypto assets in virtual worlds. Third-party trading platforms enable users to convert digital assets into fiat currency. The report states: \u201cNotably, some of the largest virtual gaming world publishers have expressed growing interest in positioning their virtual items as crypto-assets that have the ability to be traded outside of the game\u2019s economy.\u201d The report said that crypto assets in virtual environments like Decentraland and The Sandbox could be exchanged for fiat currency on other cryptocurrency platforms. Alexander Grieve, government affairs lead at Paradigm, said that reports like the one published by the CFPB could signal upcoming regulatory actions. He suggested that the CFPB, like many federal agencies, is seeking its regulatory role in the cryptosphere, with this report potentially serving as one avenue. The CFPB report states that online video games and virtual worlds are becoming akin to traditional banking but lack federal protections. The agency received complaints regarding hacking attempts, account theft and assets lost within games, with consumers expressing dissatisfaction over the lack of support from gaming companies.

SOL tokens represent the majority of the bankrupt exchange\u2019s assets. The sale received interest from asset managers and venture capitalists, including Galaxy Trading and Pantera Capital, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The bankrupt exchange sold between 25 million and 30 million locked-up SOL tokens at $64 a token, generating around $1.9 billion for FTX creditors. FTX was an early investor in Solana. Its 41 million SOL tokens are subject to a four-year vesting schedule, meaning they cannot be traded in the market until the deadline passes. According to CoinMarketCap, the SOL token is trading at $176 at the time of writing, posting an impressive 743% gain over the past 12 months, boosted by the recovery of the crypto markets and the surge of memecoins. Galaxy Trading, a division of Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital, reportedly raised roughly $620 million to purchase SOL tokens from the FTX estate. Investing in the fund will incur a 1% management fee. According to sources, the fund also seeks to generate returns for its investors from staking. Galaxy Asset Management, another branch of Galaxy Digital, assisted in exchanging and selling its assets. Pantera Capital also raised $250 million to purchase SOL tokens from FTX estate, Bloomberg said. Neptune Digital Assets, a Canadian blockchain company, acquired 26,964 SOL tokens for $64 each on March 27. The sale of FTX assets at a steep discount has sparked criticism from the exchange\u2019s creditors. On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison on charges of fraud stemming from the exchange\u2019s collapse in November 2022.

Previously, Aave Chan initiative founder Marc Zeller had argued for a 75% reduction. Aave is a crypto lending platform that runs on multiple blockchain networks. It allows borrowers to take out loans in one cryptocurrency while depositing another as collateral. It is governed by holders of the Aave token, who collectively form AaveDAO. Dai is an algorithmic stablecoin backed by multiple forms of crypto collateral, including USDC (USDC), Ethereum (ETH), and others. Dai is issued by the Maker protocol, which is governed by MakerDAO. MakerDAO was criticized on the AaveDAO forums on April 2 after it minted 600 million DAI and deposited it in a vault with decentralized lending protocol Morpho. An April 1 proposal on the MakerDAO forums attempted to increase the vault's minting limit to 1 billion DAI, potentially leading to an even greater supply of the stablecoin. MakerDAO claims that the newly minted Dai will be lent out to end-users who deposit stablecoin eUSD to the Morpho protocol. Thus, they claim that the new coins will be properly backed by stable collateral. In response, critics claim that eUSD is a risky asset and that MakerDAO is being overly aggressive in using it for collateral purposes. On April 2, Zeller proposed that the Aave LTV for Dai be set to zero instead of its current 75%, which would essentially ban Dai from being used as collateral for any new Aave loans. Zeller claimed this change is necessary because of \u201cconcerns regarding the inherent risk nature of DAI as collateral\u201d after its alleged \u201caggressive actions.\u201d The proposal is still in the discussion stage and has not been put to a formal vote. On April 5, AaveDAO\u2019s risk management consultant, Chaos Labs, analyzed the risks posed by the new vault and suggested a 12% reduction in LTV instead. This would still allow borrowers to use Dai as collateral in new loans but would require them to hold a greater collateral-to-loan ratio to compensate for the perceived increased risk. Currently, Dai depositors to Aave can only borrow 75% against the value of their Dai. The proposal from Chaos Labs would lower this amount to 63%. Related: Aave deploys DeFi protocol on BNB Chain One of the key issues in the debate is the nature of stablecoin eUSD, which is issued by the Ethena protocol. According to Ethena documents, eUSD is backed by two components: an amount of Lido Staked Ether (stETH) that market makers deposit into the protocol and a corresponding futures short position that hedges the underlying ETH represented by this deposit. This backing should be \u201cdelta neutral\u201d or incapable of declining or increasing in value, according to the documents. That\u2019s because, if the price of ETH increases, the value of the stETH deposit should increase while the value of the short futures position should decrease, causing gains and losses to net at zero. On the other hand, a decline in the price of ETH should have the opposite effect, causing a loss in the value of the deposit that exactly equals a gain in the value of the short position. Either way, the value of the eUSD token should remain stable regardless of which direction ETH price goes. In addition, the documents claim that holders can earn a yield from staking eUSD, which purportedly comes from two sources: First, the stETH deposit earns staking rewards from the Ethereum network, which can be captured by eUSD stakers. Second, the futures price for ETH is currently much higher than its spot price, creating a \u201cbasis\u201d or spread between them, which can also be captured by stakers. According to the protocol\u2019s official website, eUSD staking pays a yield of approximately 37% as of April 5. Despite this characterization of eUSD as delta-neutral, critics have claimed that it can become under-collateralized in two different circumstances. First, in a crypto bear market, the price of ETH futures could become lower than the price of spot ETH. If this occurred, the yield on the position would turn negative, implying that stakers would need to pay to hold eUSD instead of receiving payments for holding it. Critics say this would lead to a wave of redemptions, causing bad debt in the system and leading the eUSD value to go below $1. In an April 2 thread on X, Yearn.finance founder Andre Cronje argued that eUSD must eventually become \u201cunbacked\u201d due to \u201cnegative funding rates,\u201d stating: \u201cwhile things are going great now (because market is positive and shorting funding rates are positive [because everyone is happy being long]), eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.\u201d Second, a problem with Lido\u2019s staking network could lead stETH\u2019s value to decline relative to ETH. This could cause the collateral backing each eUSD to be worth less than $1. Decentralized finance educator BowTiedIguana expressed this concern in a reply to Cronje\u2019s post: \u201cOne issue that I've never seen acknowledged or discussed is that ETH is not a perfect hedge for stETH. If something bad happens on the tech side (low probability but very high impact) the unstaking queue becomes very long and the prices of the two assets diverge significantly.\u201d On April 3, Ethena protocol developers hosted a public discussion on X with MakerDAO founder Rune Christenson and Morpho development team CEO Paul Frambot, along with Zeller from Aave Chan. In the discussion, Zeller argued that MakerDAO and Morpho did not have adequate guardrails to protect Dai from its exposure. The rest of the participants claimed that eUSD poses some risk to the Maker protocol but that the development teams from all three projects (Maker, Ethene, and Morpho) were managing this risk properly.

Game developer Illuvium, for instance, is working on an interconnected environment that will combine three different titles under the same experience. In addition, Illuvium\u2019s upcoming release will offer a revenue-sharing model. \u201cWe take all the in-game revenue from players spending to travel, cure shards, purchase cosmetics, and fuel and then use it to buy ILV off the market. We then take the ILV and distribute it to stakers in the protocol. The longer you stake, the higher the amount you receive from each distribution,\u201d Kieran Warwick, Illuvium\u2019s co-founder and CEO, told Cointelegraph. The platform recently raised $12 million to support the gaming launch, which is scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. \u201cThe gaming market is about to explode,\u201d predicts Warwick. Venture capital (VC) firm Andreessen Horowitz is in the same boat. It recently announced it would inject $30 million into the intersection between tech and gaming. Along with the revived sentiment surrounding the gaming industry, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores Binance\u2019s new (and first) board of directors, Paradigm\u2019s new crypto fund and how miners are gearing up for the Bitcoin halving. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has announced it will invest $30 million in technology-centric gaming startups, including artificial intelligence (AI), virtual and artificial reality (VR/AR) and Web3 games. \u201cWe are investing at the intersection of TECH x GAMES, which means AI/infra, 3D tools, VR/AR, web3 games, gamified consumer apps, and much more,\u201d said Andrew Chen, a general partner at a16z, who oversees a16z\u2019s Games One Fund. The $30 million will be invested across the next 45 days via the firm\u2019s early-stage accelerator \u201cSPEEDRUN\u201d program, Chen said in an April 1 X post, with $750,000 handed out to each startup that joins the program. Binance Holdings, which operates the cryptocurrency exchange of the same name, has formed a seven-person board of directors filled with company executives and independent members. According to Binance\u2019s website, the firm\u2019s board of directors is now chaired by Gabriel Abed, the former ambassador of Barbados to the United Arab Emirates. Other members included Binance CEO Richard Teng, Binance co-founder Heina Chen, Bayview Acquisition Corp CEO Xin Wang, Gojo & Company managing partner Arnaud Ventura, Roger Wang and Rock He. The board\u2019s formation is likely one of the most significant changes to Binance\u2019s leadership since Teng moved from his position as head of regional markets to become CEO in November 2023. Crypto VC firm Paradigm is reportedly negotiating a raise of up to $850 million for a new fund. Paradigm is discussing with investors to raise between $750 million to $850 million as crypto markets have returned over the past months, Bloomberg reported on April 3, citing people familiar with the matter. If Paradigm completes the raise, it would be its largest since it raised a $2.5 billion fund in November 2021 at the peak of the last cycle\u2019s bull run \u2014 which was the largest cryptocurrency fund ever at the time. Some of Paradigm\u2019s most notable Web3-related investments include Coinbase, Fireblocks, Blast, Optimism, Uniswap, Gitcoin and Friend.tech. Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Bitfarms will invest nearly $240 million to upgrade its mining equipment as it aims to remain profitable after the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Bitfarms earned 286 BTC through mining in March 2024, with a monthly operating hash rate of 6.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). In March 2023, the firm mined 424 BTC with 4.8 EH/s \u2014 indicating the importance of increasing hash rate capacity to stay profitable in Bitcoin mining. Bitfarms sold nearly all the Bitcoin it mined over the past two months as it continues to reinvest into growing its mining fleet.

Terraform Labs collapsed in May 2022 following the instability of its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and other claims about the blockchain\u2019s use cases.

The beta allows users to connect Claude to external tools, which enables real-time information lookup, access and integration of third-party features into Claude\u2019s workflow. Essentially, this means users can insert simple code snippets into their account API interface that give Claude the ability to bring outside information into its conversations. One example given by Anthropic involves the use of about 10 lines of code to integrate a third-party stock ticker into the model. With this integration, the model would no longer rely on web lookup to discover stock prices \u2014 a paradigm that can result in the model confidently displaying incorrect data \u2014 but instead can pass along information verified at the source level to be correct. Because tool use for Claude uses a chain-of-thought reasoning model, the AI system is able to process complex commands requiring multiple third-party access integrations. This allows Claude to answer simultaneous queries and process requests that require step-by-step information seeking and integration. According to Anthropic, all of the available Claude AI models can handle numerous tool requests: \u201cAll models can handle correcting [sic] choosing a tool from 250+ tools provided the user query contains all necessary parameters for the intended tool with >90% accuracy. These limits apply to the total number of tools, regardless of complexity.\u201d The crypto, Web3 and blockchain communities could potentially benefit from Claude\u2019s capabilities as, for the most part, any integration developed for the platform should be usable from within the API structure. The use cases for crypto verticals could range from integrating real-time, trusted price tickers all the way to full decentralized exchange interface interoperability. Users could even connect wallet managers and portfolio trackers to the model and create trading workflows. It bears mention that AI models can make mistakes and that Claude is a general chatbot not specialized for financial, cryptocurrency, or blockchain uses specifically. This means even the most trustworthy integrations could still end up producing incorrect outputs.

According to a Reuters report on April 4, Cboe submitted a 19b-4 form requesting the green light to add an ETF share class to existing mutual funds, allowing for a multi-share class fund structure. If approved, the rule would allow issuers to combine and offer similar mutual funds and ETFs within a single investment vehicle. Todd Sohn, an ETF analyst at Strategas LLC, told Reuters that \u201cboth the number of ETFs and ETF assets could soar\u201d if the SEC approves Cboe\u2019s request. Mutual funds and ETFs present unique differences in their operations, as well as regulatory frameworks. Mutual funds are typically bought and sold at the end of the trading day at a price based on the fund\u2019s net asset value, which is calculated after the market closes. ETFs, on the other hand, trade on exchanges throughout the trading day at market prices, like stocks, and can fluctuate at any time. If the rule change is approved, Bitcoin (BTC) ETF shares could potentially be added to a mutual fund\u2019s portfolio, offering exposure to the digital asset. The proposed system won\u2019t be the first of its kind. Since 2001, the Vanguard Group has had a patented investment strategy that allowed for a unique \u201cshare class\u201d structure within their ETFs. This structure enabled Vanguard to offer ETFs as a share class of their existing mutual funds, allowing both funds to share the same underlying portfolio. Vanguard\u2019s patent on this share class concept expired in May 2023. According to Reuters, eight asset managers \u2014 including Dimensional Fund Advisors, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity \u2014 have since filed for regulatory approval to replicate the model. T.

Ether\u2019s price action has mirrored Bitcoin (BTC), which slid below $70,000 on April 1, dropping 5% over the same time period. The decline in Ether\u2019s price can be attributed to surging liquidations in the broader crypto derivatives market, decreased volume and TVL on the Ethereum network, and Ether\u2019s increasing supply on exchanges due to whale activity. Ether\u2019s price decline was followed by an uptick in liquidations in the altcoin\u2019s derivatives market.

Ethereum volume has fallen 10% over the last week. The drop in network volume comes after the highly anticipated Decun upgrade went live on March 13. Corroborating Ether\u2019s price drop was the decline in the Ethereum network\u2019s total value locked (TVL), which has fallen 1.5% in the last 24 hours and 5.5% on the week. The current Ether TVL of $47.9 billion is over $60 billion less than the all-time high of $106 billion, set on Nov. 13, 2021. Large Ethereum investors have been reducing their ETH holdings in anticipation of price drops in the short term. Data from market intelligence firm Santiment shows that the percentage of wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ETH has decreased from 30.56% on March 30 to 27% on April 5. As shown in the chart below, the percentage of those holding between 1 million and 10 million ETH has seen a sharp decline over the last seven days from 7.6% to 7%. Ether whale dissipation is supported by increasing ETH deposits on exchanges. According to Glassnode data, the number of deposit transactions to known exchange wallets started increasing on March 26, when ETH price dropped below $3,600. The deposit to exchanges continued on April 3 when ETH slid below $3,200, increasing from 20,419 transactions to 35,887 on April 5. Increasing transfer of Ether to exchanges suggests an intent to sell, which is generally a bearish sign. As such, the number of large transactions transferring Ether to exchanges has increased. On April 5, blockchain tracker Whale Alert flagged several transactions transferring large amounts of Ethereum from self-custody wallets to exchanges. One holder transferred 9,840 ETH worth $32.25 million from an unknown wallet to the Coinbase crypto exchange. Another one deposited 22,975 ETH worth $76.5 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutional. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Independent trader and analyst Daan Crypto Trades said in a X post that Bitcoin has been hovering around the 2021 cycle high for about four weeks. Historically, Bitcoin consolidates for about 4-8 weeks near the cycle highs before the price starts moving again. Although the range-bound action frustrates traders, the shallow pullback is a positive sign. Checkmate, the pseudonymous lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, said in a X post that during the previous bull market cycle between 2019 and the end of 2021, Bitcoin witnessed two corrections of more than 50%. However, pullbacks during the current bull phase have been milder, with the last 20% drawdown in September last year. The massive buying interest in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds may have limited the downside during the current cycle. Another reason for the shallow pullback could be the expectation that Bitcoin could extend its bull market after the Bitcoin halving. Will Bitcoin\u2019s current consolidation resolve to the downside or the upside? Is the correction in select altcoins over? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. Generally, the symmetrical triangle acts as a continuation pattern, but sometimes, it may behave as a reversal setup. The flattish 20-day EMA ($67,750) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns down and breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction. The BTC/USDT pair may drop to $60,000 and eventually to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. On the contrary, if the price turns up and breaks above the triangle, it will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That will increase the likelihood of the resumption of the uptrend. The pair may rise to $73,777 and subsequently to $80,000. Ether (ETH) has been trading below the 50-day SMA ($3,434) for the past three days, indicating a lack of aggressive demand at these levels. The moving averages are about to complete a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that the sellers have an advantage. There is strong support at $3,056, but if that level gets taken out, the ETH/USDT pair may decline to $2,700. Instead, if the price rebounds off the $3,056 level with strength, it will signal aggressive buying on dips. The pair may consolidate between $3,056 and $3,678 for a few days. A rise above $3,678 will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. BNB\u2019s (BNB) price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from a triangle. Hence, it is best to wait for the breakout to happen before establishing large positions. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA ($565) and breaks above the triangle, it will signal the resumption of the uptrend. The BNB/USDT pair could climb to $692 and then to the pattern target of $795. Conversely, if the price skids below the triangle, the advantage will shift in favor of the bears, and the pair could collapse to $460. If this level gives way, the next stop could be the pattern target of $395. Solana (SOL) fell below the 20-day EMA ($181) on April 5, indicating profit-booking by the short-term traders. The SOL/USDT pair could drop to the strong support at $162. If the price rebounds off this level with strength and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the pair may remain range-bound between $162 and $205 for a while. On the contrary, the pair will complete a bearish double-top pattern if the price continues lower and plunges below $162. There is a minor support at the 50-day SMA ($152), but it is likely to be broken. The pair could thereafter tumble to $126. XRP (XRP) fell below the uptrend line on April 3, and the bears successfully defended the level on April 4, indicating selling on every minor rally. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.61) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to sellers. If the price skids below $0.56, the XRP/USDT pair could slump to $0.52 and then to $0.48. If bulls want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly push the price back above the 20-day EMA. That could clear the path for a possible rally to $0.69. This level may again act as a strong barrier, but if the bulls overcome it, the pair may reach $0.74. Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.18) on April 3, and the bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price back above the level on April 4. The sellers will try to build on their advantage and yank the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.15). This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it could open the doors for a further fall to $0.12. The bulls have their work cutout. If they want to regain the upper hand, they will have to quickly propel the price above $0.19. If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could climb to the $0.23 overhead resistance. The bulls are struggling to defend the $0.57 level in Cardano (ADA), suggesting a lack of demand at current levels. If the price plummets below $0.57, it will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. This negative setup has a target objective of $0.33, but the bulls will try to arrest the fall at the strong support of $0.46. Alternatively, if the price turns up from $0.57, it will signal solid buying at lower levels. The ADA/USDT pair will then attempt a rally to $0.68, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. Related: BTC price bounces at $66K as BlackRock adds US banks to Bitcoin ETF Avalanche (AVAX) slipped below the 50-day SMA ($47) on April 3, indicating that the bears are in charge. The bulls tried to push the price back above the 50-day SMA on April 4 but failed. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $42. This is an important support, and the bulls are likely to defend it with vigor. Any recovery may again face selling at the moving averages. Buyers will have to thrust and maintain the price above the downtrend line to suggest that the correction may be over. The AVAX/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to $60 and subsequently to $65. Toncoin\u2019s (TON) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($4.73) on April 3 has reached the downtrend line, a crucial level to watch out for. If bulls thrust the price above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The TON/USDT pair could retest the $5.69 resistance. The bears are expected to fiercely defend this level because if they fail in their endeavor, the pair could skyrocket toward $7.09. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from $5.69, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between $5.69 and $4.72 for some time. The bulls are trying to push Shiba Inu (SHIB) back above the 20-day EMA ($0.000028), but the bears are not relenting. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. A break and close below the 50-day SMA ($0.000024) could accelerate selling and sink the SHIB/USDT pair to $0.000017. On the upside, the bulls will have to drive and maintain the price above the downtrend line to suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could rise to $0.000033 and later to the stiff overhead resistance at $0.000039. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The basic premise of Today revolves around the sim\u2019s digital real estate. Players use \u201cseeds\u201d of varying rarity to create their own island environment to explore. Depending on the rarity of the seed, the island will have different features, characters and objects to explore. The game is set to launch in early 2025, but a steady stream of work-in-progress videos shows off a gaming world reminiscent of the so-called \u201ccozy games\u201d genre. This includes titles such as Animal Crossings, Stardew Valley and Sun Haven, which are notable for providing a simulated social experience. This is usually accomplished through the use of compelling nonplayer characters \u2014 agents that exist in a game to propel the story and challenge or assist the player characters controlled by human users \u2014 capable of imitating conversation through the use of scripted dialogue trees. In Today\u2019s case, the company says it intends to power its nonplayer characters with generative AI technology. Generative AI includes popular tools such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude models. These systems are capable of generating compelling speech on myriad subjects. Ostensibly, they could empower NPCs capable of endless conversation. However, it\u2019s worth noting that even the most powerful generative AI systems have a tendency to output responses that contain false or nonsensical information.

We\u2019re transforming expectations by replicating the nuances of real-life dynamics using advanced AI that gives our NPCs unparalleled depth and responsiveness.\u201d Done well, this could offer players a happy medium between the eventual banality of NPCs who\u2019ve exhausted their scripted dialogue and the often-cacophonous experience that accompanies multiplayer gaming with other players.","tags":"#Funding, #AI, #Games, #Metaverse, #Web3, #NFT, #Gaming"},{"date":"Apr 05, 2024","summary":"","author":"Mike Kara","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/power-of-web3-legos-banking-module-with-crypto-wallet-integration","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Power of Web3 legos: Banking module with crypto wallet integration","type":"Blog","category":"Spotlight","content":" In a strategic move to address the complexities of converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency, Fiat24 \u2014 a Swiss financial institution \u2014 has joined forces with SafePal, a crypto wallet provider, to launch a crypto Visa debit card with an in-app banking service. With all its advancements and the promise of financial freedom, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector still presents a considerable challenge for users who want to convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat. The current process involves multiple time-consuming steps that come with the risk of incurring high fees and experiencing significant delays due to how blockchain transactions work. To minimize slippage fees on decentralized exchanges (DEX), users look to split their orders across multiple trades in different withdrawal times, adding to the complexity and potential inconvenience. The unnecessary complexity of a simple cash-out \u2014 or crypto off-ramp in Web3 jargon \u2014 poses a significant barrier for everyday uses, hindering the crypto adoption for daily transactions and financial management. This is where the innovative partnership between the financial institution Fiat24 and crypto wallet provider SafePal comes into prominence. Together, they announced a crypto Visa debit card coupled with an in-app banking service to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional banking, offering users a seamless experience for managing their finances across both realms. Akin to a cross-chain bridge that seamlessly connects crypto assets with fiat assets, Fiat24 facilitates the fluid transition of digital currencies into the traditional monetary system, bypassing the conventional complexities. Featuring a protocol-to-protocol integration, the banking module operates independently from the wallet. This independence ensures that the banking service can be utilized in combination with any DeFi protocols. Additionally, the fiat gateway is open for not only centralized exchanges but also for DEXs like Uniswap, broadening the utility and access for users across the DeFi ecosystem.  Fiat24 stands out as a Swiss-licensed and regulated financial entity that innovatively uses public blockchain technology to facilitate transactions. By operating on the Arbitrum blockchain, Fiat24 ensures transparency and security for its users, offering a unique blend of DeFi and traditional banking (TradFi) services. The platform acts as a dynamic bridge between the digital and traditional financial worlds, enabling seamless transactions within the DeFi space and the broader financial world, including direct connections to major payment systems like SWIFT and SEPA. Users can utilize their Swiss IBAN (International Bank Account Number) to send and receive money as they would with any other bank account, all while being connected to their preferred noncustodial crypto wallet and accessed by the Fiat24 nonfungible token (NFT). Fiat24 functions as a modular banking protocol, capable of independent operation or seamless integration with a variety of DeFi protocols, including DEXs, lending platforms and staking services. This flexibility is achieved through the Lego principle, allowing for versatile combinations with other DeFi elements. Fiat24\u2019s new partner, SafePal, offers a comprehensive crypto wallet suite that provides hardware wallet, mobile app and browser extension wallet solutions. With the backing of industry giants like Binance Labs and Animoca Brands, SafePal serves over 10 million users worldwide. The platform supports an impressive array of blockchains and tokens, providing users with comprehensive tools for managing their crypto assets securely and efficiently since its foundation in 2018.  The new joint service uses USD Coin (USDC) as the default deposit currency, leveraging the collaboration with Circle, a global financial technology firm, to enhance the accessibility and ease of crypto transactions. By picking one of the most widely-used stablecoins as the deposit cryptocurrency, Fiat24 and SafePal aim to mitigate the common onboarding challenges faced by newcomers to the crypto space, making the transition smoother and more user-friendly. Through their collaboration with Circle and the focus on USDC, Fiat24 and SafePal strive to establish a new standard for ease and effectiveness in the conversion of digital currencies to fiat. This approach broadens access and simplifies the introduction to digital finance for users globally, ensuring a smoother transition into the crypto ecosystem. As this partnership unfolds, it promises to unlock new possibilities for financial autonomy and inclusivity, heralding a new era where managing digital and fiat currencies is not just possible but effortless.","tags":"#Visa, #Cryptocurrencies, #Wallet, #Partnership, #DeFi"},{"date":"Apr 05, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ana Paula Pereira","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/blackrock-updates-btc-etf-adds-5-wall-street-firms","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"BlackRock updates Bitcoin ETF, adds 5 Wall Street firms","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Global asset manager BlackRock updated its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) prospectus on April 5, adding five big Wall Street firms as new authorized participants.

Among the previously authorized participants in the ETF are JPMorgan Securities, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital and Virtu Americas. Authorized participants play a crucial role in the BTC ETF operational mechanism, as they can create and redeem shares of the ETF, which involves exchanging ETF shares for a corresponding basket of securities that reflect the ETF\u2019s holdings or exchanging them for cash. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the new additions indicate that \u201cbig time firms now want piece of action and/or are now OK being publicly associated w[ith] this.\u201d The SEC\u2019s position on a cash creation and redemption mechanism for Bitcoin ETFs was primarily directed at mitigating market manipulation risks associated with transactions. The cash mechanism entails that new shares of a Bitcoin ETF will only be created or redeemed through cash transactions, in contrast to the traditional in-kind model, where market participants handle the underlying assets directly. This approach was developed to prevent intraday price manipulation, according to initial proposals by asset managers like Hashdex. Following the SEC\u2019s guidance, other asset managers \u2014 including giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest and Grayscale \u2014 have incorporated this mechanism into their filings. The Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a spike in trading volume in March, reaching $111 billion, while some analysis suggests the product\u2019s demand is cooling down.

In an April 5 notice, Montenegro\u2019s Supreme Court said it had approved a request for a protection of legality against a lower court decision that would have allowed Kwon\u2019s extradition to South Korea. Prosecutors who made the request argued that an appellate court violated procedure in rejecting an appeal from Kwon\u2019s legal team, placing the final decision on the Supreme Court. \u201cIn a situation where it is a matter of competing requests from two states for the extradition of the same person, and not a conflict of requests for the extradition of the same person, as found by the lower courts, the court\u2019s obligation is to determine, in accordance with its powers, whether the legal conditions for extradition have been met the defendant in relation to each petition individually, after which the competent minister, not the court, decides on the permission and order of priority of extradition,\u201d said the ruling. The Supreme Court said the decision of Kwon\u2019s extradition would return to the High Court in Podgorica, which could decide whether the Terraform co-founder is sent to the U.S. or his native South Korea.

Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the investment arm of the royal government of Bhutan, and the Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer reportedly announced that they will invest in increasing their mining project\u2019s capacity sixfold ahead of the halving. Bitdeer\u2019s chief business officer said the planned upgrades will raise Bhutan\u2019s mining capacity by 500 megawatts by the first half of 2025. This would increase the Himalayan kingdom\u2019s total mining capacity to 600 megawatts. The funds needed to introduce new hardware for the upgrade will be taken from the $500 million fund the duo announced last year. On May 3, 2023, the two entities announced the creation of a closed-end fund valued at $500 million. Bitdeer chairman Jihan Wu said at the time their company would work with DHI to use Bhutan\u2019s zero-emission energy to support blockchain technologies. Wu said that the fund would help develop international stakeholder networks that could help Bhutan\u2019s technology sector. Bhutan\u2019s DHI, which manages over $2.9 billion in assets, had quietly grown a crypto portfolio before it was brought to light in the bankruptcy proceedings of crypto firms Celsius and BlockFi.

According to the National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom, 29 million phishing scams have been reported since the beginning of 2024. Blockchain security platform Scam Sniffer further found that over 324,000 crypto users fell victim to phishing scams in 2023. The \u201c2023 Wallet Drainers Report\u201d noted that around $295 million in digital assets were lost to wallet drainers in 2023. As phishing scams rise, some cryptocurrency exchanges have started to encourage users to incorporate specific devices to protect their funds. Jacob Klein, director and head of trust and safety at Coinbase, told Cointelegraph that Coinbase was one of the first crypto exchanges to provide YubiKey compatibility. While Yubico introduced YubiKey devices in 2008, some crypto exchanges began allowing customers to use them following the first major bull run in 2019. \u201cYubiKey devices are the most secure form of authentication that we provide,\u201d said Klein. According to Klein, YubiKey devices can serve as a form of two-factor authentication (2FA), which Coinbase requires. \u201cThis would mean a user would have to use their physical YubiKey device to access their account,\u201d he said. This can be helpful, as Klein noted that account passwords can get lost or even breached in phishing attacks. \u201cWith all the phishing scams taking place, the question users must consider is, \u2018How can I avoid myself from getting hacked?\u2019 This is why a YubiKey may seem like the obvious and best solution to protect crypto funds,\u201d he said. Recent: Crypto bull run ignites surge in job listings, salary increases Cryptocurrency exchange Binance also introduced YubiKey devices to users in 2019. Jimmy Su, chief security officer at Binance, told Cointelegraph, \u201cHaving physical access to the Yubikey is what makes it the most secured 2FA method. The only way an attacker can bypass this is to gain access to YubiKey. This is in contrast to passing a one-time-password code via SMS or email, which is much more susceptible to phishing attacks.\u201d While YubiKey devices may be one of the best measures to protect against phishing, crypto exchanges have recently adopted newer solutions for users. For example, Klein shared that Coinbase supports a new form of MFA called \u201cpasskeys,\u201d which are \u201ca form of user authentication that uses a cryptographic technique linked to a user\u2019s device, like their smartphone.\u201d According to Klein, any Coinbase user can turn on the passkey option when accessing their account. Khaja Ahmed, the chief information security officer at cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, told Cointelegraph Gemini also recently released support for passkeys, stating, \u201cSince passkeys don\u2019t involve an external physical device, they are somewhat more convenient than a physical YubiKey.\u201d Tom D\u2019Eletto, head of product at crypto security platform Arculus, told Cointelegraph that while software passkeys are a step in the right direction, a hardware-bound passkey \u2014 whether it is a USB dongle or an NFC-enabled card \u2014 is the gold standard for security. D\u2019Eletto explained that \u201cFIDO2\u201d is an open standard used by both passkeys and YubiKeys. He shared that Arculus recently implemented its own FIDO2-certified keys, which come in the form of a metal credit card. \u201cUSB hardware keys [...] have not achieved mainstream mass adoption despite being on the market for many years,\u201d said D\u2019Eletto. \u201cArculus puts a FIDO2 authenticator on a metal credit card form factor, allowing people with an Arculus authenticator to simply tap their card to the back of their phone to authenticate.\u201d D\u2019Eletto said this provides users with a more familiar experience: \u201cThink of this like an ATM experience \u2014 when you go to an ATM, to access your account, you use your PIN and your bank card.

Madar said these devices\u2019 most compelling use case is to mitigate end-user account takeovers. While this can protect users against phishing attacks, Madar emphasized that a YubiKey or passkey cannot protect against a cryptocurrency exchange hack.

According to the announcement on April 5, the Hong Kong-based virtual bank is opening up security for fiat reserves, which issuers can use to back digital assets.

This is evident through significant declines in crypto asset prices and trading volumes from their previous highs. Distinct from traditional capital markets, the cryptocurrency sector lacks standardized metrics to identify the onset of a crypto winter. EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO Nevertheless, a pattern has been observed that tends to span a four-year cycle. This cycle starts with an increase in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), leading up to the block reward halving. After the halving, a price downturn typically begins after crypto assets achieve new all-time highs. The term crypto winter is not officially declared by any specific regulatory body or organization but is recognized by a consistent trend of declining prices across various cryptocurrencies. This phase began in January 2018 and extended through December 2020. During this period, Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), the two leading cryptocurrencies, experienced a loss of over 80% in value from their all-time highs. Bitcoin had previously reached a peak of nearly $20,000 toward the end of 2017, while Ether had ascended to over $1,400 before both saw a sharp decrease in value by September 2018. Among the top 100 listed cryptocurrencies, 95% recorded a substantial drop in value. Multiple inherent industry challenges triggered the crypto winter of 2018. These included the notably high failure rate of initial coin offerings, where over 97% did not meet their objectives, coupled with the issue of individual investors being overly leveraged. Regulatory concerns further complicated the situation, leading to a significant withdrawal of investors from the market. The aftermath of the 2018 crypto crash profoundly affected the perception of cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions began to view the crypto market skeptically, labeling it as potentially speculative, while governments worldwide advised caution regarding crypto investments. This period of inactivity shifted in July 2019, when investor enthusiasm began to warm up, propelling the price of Bitcoin beyond the $10,000 threshold. This revival in the market\u2019s fortunes, however, was short-lived. In March 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced a significant liquidity crisis that impacted markets globally, including the cryptocurrency market. EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO Despite the significant downturn in 2018, the year also witnessed pivotal developments for Ethereum. During this period, Ethereum began laying the groundwork for its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system despite facing delays and rescheduling efforts. Early in 2018, network congestion was caused by the popularity of CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game. This event highlighted the need for Ethereum to improve its scalability. In response, Ethereum explored the concept of sharding, a process that divides the blockchain into several smaller, more manageable segments known as shard chains or data layers. Each shard operates independently, allowing for parallel processing of information, which can significantly enhance the blockchain\u2019s scalability. However, Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain was slower than anticipated, with multiple delays along the way. According to its 2017 roadmap, two significant upgrades were planned from Ethereum \u2014 Metropolis and Serenity \u2014 to improve scalability by introducing proof-of-stake and sharding. The Metropolis upgrade was to be implemented in two phases: Byzantine, which focused on privacy improvements, and Constantinople, which would introduce a hybrid proof-of-work+PoS system. Nonetheless, by June 2018, Ethereum abandoned the hybrid approach in favor of a more straightforward PoS system known as Casper 2.0. Although initially expected in 2019, this transition was completed in 2021, illustrating the complexities involved in upgrading such a significant and widely-used blockchain platform. In a notable development during this period, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified Ether as a non-security in June. This decision made Ether only the second asset, after Bitcoin, to receive such a designation, sparking discussions and debates in subsequent years. In 2019, Ethereum gained significant attention due to its technical progress and decentralized finance (DeFi) expansion as an ecosystem. Over the course of the year, the DeFi sector experienced considerable growth, with the total value locked in DeFi protocols increasing to $667 million by Dec. 31, 2019. Initially dominated by MakerDAO, which held 1.86 million ETH (approximately $260.4 million in value at the time), the sector saw an influx of new participants by year\u2019s end. Decentralized Exchanges also experienced significant growth, gaining traction amid the prevailing popularity of centralized exchanges. Uniswap emerged as a key player, with its average daily trading volume increasing from $25,000 to $1.5 million and its liquidity expanding from $500,000 to $25 million. Moreover, Ethereum began to attract attention from various sectors, including major corporations, financial institutions, consumer brands and celebrities. Basketball player Spencer Dinwiddie announced a initiative to tokenize his NBA contract on Ethereum, creating 90 Ethereum-based tokens. These tokens allowed holders to invest in a portion of Dinwiddie\u2019s futures contract earnings plus interest. Dinwiddie received $13.5 million upfront from his $34 million contract through this arrangement. The Sacramento Kings, a professional basketball team, launched a rewards program using a token built on Ethereum to enhance fan engagement through blockchain technology. In the entertainment industry, the Star Trek franchise announced it would issue a series of collectible ships as nonfungible tokens on Ethereum, leveraging the platform for digital collectibles.

The protocol\u2019s block monitoring tool, Starkscan, showed an outage of four hours in block production. Starkscan shows a gap between the creation of blocks 630028 and 630029 on April 4, while Starknet\u2019s status page did not reflect any outages on the network on the same day. Starknet subsequently released a statement on X, explaining that a rounding error bug led to a reorganization of blocks. The company said block production continued as usual, but the reorganization caused a transaction backlog that prevented it from reaching full capacity. \u201cConsequently, there were a few minutes during which new transactions could not be accepted for processing and were therefore rejected. Moreover, some transactions were reverted due to changing parameters (e.g., timestamps),\u201d the post explains. Cointelegraph contacted Starknet to confirm the details of the incident but has not received additional information and if block production was halted as per block data. Starknet\u2019s status page last reflects a major outage on March 13 when its network experienced slow block creation due to Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. Starknet\u2019s outage is the latest in a series of hiccups for some of the ecosystem\u2019s largest blockchain networks. Solana suffered a significant outage in early February 2024. Downtime in block production on its mainnet halted the network\u2019s block progression for over five hours. It was not the first time Solana had gone down. Since January 2022, Solana has seen around half a dozen significant outages and 15 partial or major outage days. Solana-focused software development firm Anza released a postmortem report of the recent outage on Feb. 9. The report revealed that Solana\u2019s Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation cache, which compiles all programs before executing a transaction, encountered a bug. Related: Starknet anticipates significant impact from Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork Austin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph that a process was underway to replace the old loader system with a new motor system, but it was scheduled to be disabled with an updated version. \u201cIt looks like someone intentionally called that old instruction set, which hadn\u2019t been used in quite a long time but was still around in the codebase. The JIT compiler ran into issues where it couldn\u2019t find what it was looking for. And that\u2019s what created the infinite loop,\u201d Federa told Cointelegraph. Solana encountered problems again in early April, with close to 75% of all transactions on the network failing amid a deluge of activity brought by the recent memecoin mania. Analysts suggest that these failed transactions are mainly due to bot activities on Solana, which look to carry out arbitrage trades.

Additionally, foreign digital assets can be listed on domestic exchanges only if a white paper or technical manual is published for the South Korean market. However, tokens already listed on a licensed exchange for over two years may not need to meet these new criteria. The directives might also stipulate that exchanges must remove cryptocurrencies from their listings if the issuers fail to adequately disclose essential information, such as discrepancies between the actual circulation and the disclosed amount. The report further stated that the South Korean government is gathering opinions from local exchanges. Since the latter part of 2023, the Financial Supervisory Service has been formulating listing guidelines by soliciting feedback from stakeholders such as the Digital Asset Exchange Association.

According to a report from local media outlet Nikkei on April 4, the trial is set to occur on the Polygon blockchain and in collaboration with the Belgium-based blockchain company SettleMint. The reports were confirmed by Jun Watanabe, the president and representative director of Sony Network Communications, in a post on X. Sony Bank said it will assess any legal issues that may be tied to transferring yen-backed stablecoins. It anticipates these experiments will stretch out over the next few months. The banking firm said by utilizing stablecoins, it could potentially take advantage of lower fees for individuals when sending money and making payments. It also said it would consider it as a form of payment for businesses that use intellectual property (IP) owned by the Sony Group, including games and sports. The Sony Group has recently been experimenting with incorporating other Web3 technologies in its operations, as its video game division filed a patent in March 2023 to adopt nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in an initiative it called \u201cNFT framework for transferring and using Digital Assets between game platforms.\u201d This move was in an effort to provide its gamers with more opportunities associated with their in-game assets.

But as technology progressed, metaverses like Decentraland and The Sandbox narrowed down the gaps between the real and digital world, making way for many new use cases. According to Statista, by 2023, the metaverse industry will hit an astonishing $507.8 billion, up from its current value of $74.4 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 37.73% between 2024 and 2023. To enter the metaverse and engage in an immersive virtual world, users must create an avatar representing them in the metaverse, enabling them to play games, go shopping or socially interact with others. This article explains the metaverse, the role of avatars, the types of avatars, cross-platform avatars, and how to create a metaverse avatar using Decentraland. The metaverse is a digital space connecting the internet, augmented reality, virtual worlds and blockchains to create immersive experiences and interactions between avatars representing humans. Like humans, avatars can communicate with digital objects and one another. The metaverse is gradually evolving into a dynamically networked digital cosmos that muddies the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds. However, the idea of digital avatars is not new. Their prominence goes back to the 1980s when they derived their popularity from video games like Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar. Thanks to avatars, players can fully immerse themselves in virtual worlds and feel the thrill of playing the game in the real world. They can access the metaverse through virtual reality (VR) headsets, PCs, laptops and smartphones. Depending on their preferences, users can choose from a range of metaverse avatars. To optimize experience in avatars, the player needs to understand the type of avatars they can create: Users can create a full-body VR avatar, which is a complete digital representation of a person, offering a greater sense of immersion in the metaverse. Sensors are used to capture the user\u2019s entire body movements and replicate them in virtual spaces. On older systems, these avatars don\u2019t provide users with a visual depiction; instead, they are used for virtual reality, allowing users to experience the virtual world in the \u201cfirst-person\u201d sense. 2D avatars are simple, cartoon-like representations confined to 2D environments. 3D avatars, on the other hand, facilitate customization of elements such as skin tone, body form and hair, giving the character a realistic multi-angle view. A humanoid avatar reflects the physical appearance of its owner, creating a sense of familiarity and closeness. It is designed to resemble real humans and can even mimic the user\u2019s exact appearance. A humanoid avatar facilitates seamless integration between the virtual and physical worlds. The metaverse technology is still young, and few people know how to prop up an avatar. Here is the process users can follow to create a metaverse avatar: All metaverses enable their users to create an avatar to enter the digital realm. They can also choose an external avatar creation app, downloadable via Google Play or the Apple Store, to create personalized digital avatars that can be used across several platforms. The system, whether on a metaverse or an avatar app, will usually ask the user about their gender to choose an appropriate style for the avatar. Anyone who wants the software to create an avatar that resembles their face can add an image. Most apps will offer an array of premade avatars from which users can select. Users can customize features such as hair color, eye size, nose shape, lip shape and other attributes, allowing them to create an avatar that reflects their preferences. A well-created avatar can add a visually engaging element to interactions in the metaverse. The following is an example of how users can create a custom avatar on the Decentraland metaverse to help understand the process better. Decentraland enables users to explore a 3D dynamic universe and make their own avatars in the virtual world. They can travel, engage in various activities and make new friends. Making an avatar is the first step for users to enjoy Decentraland\u2019s rewards. Here\u2019s the process of creating an avatar on Decentraland: Users need to log in to Decentraland and input the details in the window. Depending on availability, the platform may accept or reject the username when they feed in the details. If the platform accepts the user name, the user must input their email ID to create an avatar, or else they must populate the user name again in the field. Decentraland will take the user to the next page upon the completion of the process. The user needs to mint a name ID to create an avatar. When they click on \u201cClaim your name,\u201d they are assigned a name for their avatar. The user needs to buy the Decentraliand (MANA) token at this stage. Click on \u201cBuy MANA,\u201d visible on the top right side of the screen, to trigger a mint executed by a smart contract. Users can buy MANA with fiat currency or other digital currencies. One can pick from an array of avatars and customize its look based on body, face, hair, top, bottom, shoes and accessories. The user can also select the skin tone and shape of their avatar. The avatar is now ready for use in the Decentraland metaverse. It can be used for gameplay and other activities. Anyone active on several metaverses will find creating an avatar on every platform they visit problematic and unnecessarily expensive, highlighting the need for a platform-agnostic solution. Thankfully, some apps enable users to conjure up an avatar and use it on any platform they visit. Users can update their clothes, hairstyles or accessories to suit different environments. Users of these services usually need to create an account using connected services like Google, Microsoft or Slack. Users may also create an account using their email address. The system will then prompt them to make an avatar. Apart from using the array of avatars offered by these apps, users can also use their webcam or upload a photo of themselves. They can then use the photo-editing features of the app to create a customized avatar that closely resembles them. Some advanced avatar-creation solutions also use artificial intelligence to produce photorealistic 3D avatars from selfie photos. According to research published by Exploding Topics, 68% of experts believe that the popularity of the metaverse will rise sharply in the next three to five years. A Pew Research Center report states that 54% of technology experts expect the metaverse to offer immersive experiences by 2040. Such an experience cannot be possible without better customized and engaging avatars representing the users themselves. Due to evolving technologies, new possibilities have emerged in avatar creation, and the time of ugly, legless avatars is now gone. Users can now create highly personalized avatars with a few clicks or taps. As the apps develop further and more innovations emerge, the avatars can make the virtual world more realistic and engaging.","tags":"#Virtual Reality, #Metaverse, #NFT, #Decentraland, #How to"},{"date":"Apr 05, 2024","summary":"","author":"Arijit Sarkar","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/prisma-finance-protocol-restart-dao-vote","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Prisma Finance eyes protocol restart with DAO support","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Prisma Finance has devised a plan to safely unpause the Prisma protocol, which was halted on March 28 after it suffered a hack of $11.6 million.

New BTC price prediction sees cycle top at $180K BTCFi emerged following the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard, which enabled the minting of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time. Bitcoin-native NFTs, also known as Ordinals, are inscribed directly on satoshis (sats), giving them a permanent home on the Bitcoin network, unlike most NFT collections, to which the images and metadata are stored on centralized servers, creating potential vulnerabilities. Showcasing the interest in Bitcoin-native NFTs, the network surpassed 64.1 million Ordinals inscriptions in less than one and a half years since the first Ordinal was inscribed in December 2022, according to Dune. Beyond Ordinals, the emergence of Bitcoin layer-2s is another significant element of BTCFi, which will ultimately give more use cases to Bitcoin. Lee said: \u201cBefore the advent of layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin native assets lacked practical applications, confining BTC\u2019s role largely to that of digital gold.

The trend is a seeming reversal from the last two years, where most gains were concentrated during U.S. trading hours. Research firm 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen suggests the new trend allows investors to capitalize on frequent small profit margins. \u201cTraders can take advantage of this information and buy Bitcoin ahead of the U.S. trading hours and sell a few hours later,\u201d Thielen told Cointelegraph. On April 4, Bitcoin rallied approximately 2.6% outside U.S. hours, while prices only rose around 0.6% during U.S. hours. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also noted in an April 5 post on X that \u201cthe vast majority of the 40% gains\u201d in Bitcoin since spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced on Jan. 11 happened outside regular U.S. market trading hours. U.S. trading hours are the operating hours of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq stock exchange, running from 2:30 pm to 9:00 pm UTC. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,400 with Cointelegraph recently reporting a 64% growth in Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2024. Thielen explained that investors, including those from other time zones, often anticipate surges in ETF inflows by buying Bitcoin before the market opens: \u201cWe also noticed through our data analysis that Bitcoin tends to rise during the 1-4 hours before U.S. ETFs start trading on that day, a sign that there is likely front running of the ETF flow occurring,\u201d he added. On April 4, Bitcoin experienced a slight 2.6% rise in the four hours before the opening of the U.S. market, climbing from $65,593 to $67,308. However, Thielen noted that U.S. investors tend to take advantage of the market spread between the spot market and the futures market: \u201cThe buying flow during US trading hours appears mostly arbitrage - buying Bitcoin Spot ETFs but selling CME-listed Bitcoin futures as hedge funds pocked the futures premium,\u201d Thielen stated. Related: Bitcoin is hedge against \u2018horrible\u2019 gov\u2019t fiscal policy \u2014 Cathie Wood It\u2019s not the first time an asset has been singled out for gains outside U.S. trading hours. In June 2022, two ETF funds, the NightShares 500 ETF and the NightShares 2000 (NIWM), were launched to take advantage of the overnight increases in U.S. stocks. According to a report from the Financial Post in July 2023, the products were discontinued just one year later because other factors, such as off-hours announcements, data releases and earnings reports, can diminish performance. Before the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it was understood that Asian investors did more of the selling during Asian market hours. In March 2022, Cointelegraph reported that investors based in Asia have generally been sellers, while those in the U.S. and the European Union have been buyers for the previous two years. Glassnode researcher and report writer \u201cCheckmate\u201d pointed out that U.S. and European investors offered general bid support for the past two years. However, Asian markets generally offered lower buying support through Q1\u2013Q3 of 2021 and produced heavy selling pressure.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is still chasing charges against Binance, its U.S. arm and Zhao, alleging they sold unregistered securities and commingled customer assets. FTX co-founder Zixiao \u201cGary\u201d Wang, engineering lead Nishad Singh and Alameda Research ex-CEO Caroline Ellison will be sentenced in New York at some point for their roles in the massive fraud carried out at the exchange.

With Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial over, paused lawsuits from the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission charging him with securities and commodity law violations are set to also resume soon. In March last year, the U.S. lumped Terraform co-founder Do Kwon with a string of fraud and market manipulation charges after his crypto ecosystem tied to an algorithm-backed stablecoin ended up not being very stable. The U.S. has tussled with Kwon\u2019s native South Korea to extradite him from Montenegro. Kwon won an appeal to stop his extradition to the U.S., and he\u2019s free in Montenegro while its Supreme Court deliberates on U.S. and South Korea\u2019s extradition requests. The SEC has a suit against Kwon for allegedly selling unregistered securities in a New York federal court, and that\u2019s gone to trial even though he\u2019s not there.

The charges carry a combined maximum sentence of 45 years, and Storm has pleaded not guilty and asked they be dismissed as he said there was little he could do to stop U.S.-sanctioned entities using the tool. His co-developer, Roman Semenov, is at large and is believed to be in Russia. Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky has his criminal trial set for Sept. 17 on seven charges relating to various fraud and market manipulation, totaling a maximum sentence of 115 years.

For those who have ever encountered someone dismissing Bitcoin as a scam or claiming its value is unsubstantiated, Cointelegraph\u2019s latest video dismantles the five most prevalent misconceptions about premier cryptocurrency. One of the most common anti-Bitcoin (BTC) talking points is that it lacks \u201cintrinsic value.\u201d It\u2019s true that, unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by a central bank, and its value doesn\u2019t stem from traditional cash flows or dividends of publicly traded stocks. However, dismissing Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value overlooks the unique attributes that render it valuable: decentralization and borderlessness, which enable efficient global value exchange, and scarcity, which make it an appealing hedge against currency devaluation. Another prevalent accusation is that Bitcoin operates as a Ponzi scheme, where early adopters profit from subsequent investors until the scheme collapses. While it's accurate that early Bitcoin adopters amassed wealth as the digital asset's value surged, comparing Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme ignores a crucial distinction: Bitcoin operates within a fully decentralized network devoid of any central controlling entity.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC has been fluctuating between $62,800 and $71,860 for nearly two weeks, suggesting indecisiveness among traders about the next direction the price might take. Let\u2019s look at the reasons why BTC price remains stuck today. Bitcoin has already seen new all-time highs in 2024, along with a series of recoveries back above $70,000, but each has failed to spark a broader price trend. Instead, BTC has \u201cbeen hanging around its 2021 cycle high for about four weeks now,\u201d according to independent trader and analyst Daan Crypto Trades. Drawing from historical price action, the largest cryptocurrency could remain range-bound for one or two months before establishing any directional bias. Daan Crypto Trades said, \u201cDuring previous cycles, it took $BTC 4-8 weeks of consolidation around its previous cycle highs to start moving again.\u201d After turning away from its all-time highs at $73,835, BTC entered the consolidation phase, as observed by crypto trader and X user Jelle. According to Jelle, a bullish breakout from this technical formation would see the price climb to $80,000. Bitcoin\u2019s current sideways movement aligns with the transfer of BTC holdings from known exchange wallets to private custody. This number has increased from 12,152 wallets to 26,627 between March 31 and April 4. The increase in BTC withdrawals from exchanges aligns with a surge in whale activity during the same timeframe, further mirroring accumulation by large investors. Whales represent entities that hold more than 1,000 BTC. Data tracked by Whale alerts reveals that 2,100 BTC worth over $138,205,430 were transferred from Kraken to an unknown wallet on April 3. Earlier on April 2, another whale transferred a total of 2,130 #BTC worth $141,233,842 from Kraken to an unknown wallet. Related: Bitcoin taps $67.5K as 2% BTC price gains accompany US jobless claims This transfer of BTC from exchanges to wallets, particularly by large investors, shows a lack of intention by investors to liquidate their holdings, thereby diminishing market volatility. Observing Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart, it appears that its current period of price stability is unfolding above the $65,000 support level. According to popular analyst Rekt Capital, the price of BTC has failed to retest its record highs above $73,000, occasionally recovering above the \u201cold all-time High of ~$69,000\u201d over the last two weeks. \u201cBTC first would need to hold the weekly range low of $65,600 to protect the range, Rekt Capital said, adding, \u201cmomentum is going to be slowing as BTC approaches the supply halving.\u201d Data from on-chain metrics aggregator IntotheBlock reinforce the significance of the support at $65,000. Its In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model revealed that BTC enjoyed relatively strong support on the downside compared to the resistance it faced in its recovery path. According to the IOMAP chart below, the $65,000 support zone is where approximately 645,830 BTC were previously bought by roughly one million addresses. With just a few weeks before the halving, BTC\u2019s price could consolidate inside the $65,000 level in the short term. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) \u2014 the regulatory framework that governs digital assets within the region \u2014 the European Commission is required to prepare a report by Dec. 30, 2024, evaluating the decentralized finance market and the feasibility of specific regulations for the sector. \u201cIn preparation for this report, we have initiated a number of actions. For instance, we are running a study on embedded supervision. No policy decisions have been taken yet,\u201d a Commission spokesperson told Cointelegraph. The report is tasked with exploring how decentralized systems, particularly those without a clear issuer or service provider, should be regulated. \u201cA significant aspect of this assessment will be to explore the regulation of crypto-asset lending and borrowing, a core activity within the DeFi space,\u201d Maxim Galash, CEO of CoinChange Financials, explained in an analysis. DeFi represents a shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies built on blockchain. While traditional finance laws often depend on regulating central parties like banks or financial services providers, decentralized systems operate without such intermediaries. A potential new regulation has raised concerns about the legal viability of some crypto projects. MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen noted that the rules could place some DeFi interfaces, such as decentralized exchanges, under licensing requirements. \u201cThis would make DeFi frontends on normal internet domains, as we know them today, impossible. Only fully decentralized, local, downloaded frontends or full-KYC online frontends would be possible. Sad,\u201d he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). In the same vein, XReg Consulting partner Nathan Catania believes that an eventual DeFi regulation would apply to all non-fully decentralized applications, including DeFi frontends. According to Catania, the MiCA regulation does not define what constitutes decentralization, and the extent of DeFi rules would significantly depend on the criteria used to determine the concept. \u201cEven protocols which are not decentralised enough could be seen to be performing CASP services such as exchanging crypto-assets for other crypto-assets. For front-ends, there are also services such as reception and transmission of orders on behalf of third parties. So it could come down to how strict regulators want to be when enforcing this.\u201d Under the MiCA regulation, a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) is any entity that provides services related to digital assets to third parties, including exchange services, transfer services, and custodian wallets, for example. According to Catania, one of the key factors that regulators might consider in evaluating the level of decentralization is whether a professional service is being performed. \u201cA front-end that simply provides users an interface to access DeFi without any control over users\u2019 funds, and which doesn\u2019t charge a fee is less likely to be at risk than a front-end that adds a fee on top and even then you would need to consider the legal and technical details to be able to determine whether that activity should be licensed under MiCA.\u201d Another possible route for DeFi regulation would be through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). According to Coinchange\u2019s Galash, the FATF proposes that in certain scenarios, individuals or entities maintaining control or significant influence over DeFi arrangements may be categorized as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). \u201cThis classification applies even if the arrangements appear decentralized, underscoring the complexity of defining and regulating DeFi activities,\u201d Galash wrote. Based on data from DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has experienced a substantial increase over the past four years, from $570 million in April 2020 to $96.7 billion at the time of writing, representing a 16,865% growth over the period. \u201cThe key question is whether the DeFi arrangement is simply a technological arrangement or whether there is actually a controlling party behind it that can influence user value,\" said Catania.

Web3 projects often use on-chain and social media tasks such as sending messages, following or liking to increase their brand\u2019s awareness. They generally reward users who complete these tasks with digital assets. However, the Web3 landscape is disrupted by autonomous software, known as \u2018bots,\u2019 that mimic human actions and hijack rewards. Projects subject to bot intrusion suffer reputational damage and must spend additional resources to rid their systems of them. To establish sustainable and authentic interactions, marketing efforts need to be enhanced with anti-bot systems. Midle, a Web3-powered marketing platform from the GAMI ecosystem, utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and a wide array of networks to integrate anti-bot technologies, ensuring genuine interactions. As a task-to-earn ecosystem, Midle presents innovative approaches to Web3 marketing by bringing together projects, users and influencers. Users can collect points by completing tasks and get rewards, while brands increase user acquisition, retention and engagement by creating tasks and campaigns.  Midle provides tools to ensure authenticity, streamline marketing efforts and target specific user demographics. Source: Midle Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Midle\u2019s automated task system simplifies social media engagement and Web3 projects\u2019 marketing efforts. When projects share a post on their social media accounts, Midle\u2019s system can automatically create tasks such as \u2018retweet,\u2019 \u2018like,\u2019 and \u2018comment\u2019 for the post. With the user segmentation being developed by Midle, Web3 projects will be able to appeal to a more niche audience by creating campaigns that only target users can see. For example, a gaming project will be able to develop campaigns focused only on users interested in Web3 gaming. Midle has partnered with Taiko Labs, which recently raised $37 million, to expand its ecosystem. The Web3 marketing platform launched a campaign of 500,000 Midle points for on-chain tasks after being integrated into the Taiko Katla testnet. Beyond the Taiko partnership, Midle has received grants from blockchain networks such as BNB Chain, Nibiru Chain, and Plena Finance. Nibiru-specific campaigns on Midle will begin with the launch of Nibiru Chain on the mainnet.  Midle, which aims to achieve sustainable Web3 marketing, receives support from the ecosystem\u2019s prominent names. Source: Midle Castrum Capital, a venture capital (VC) firm specializing in Web3 initiatives, has backed Midle\u2019s fundraising efforts by acting as the initial investor and leading the funding round. Apart from investments and grants, Midle announced that the platform will launch its utility token this year. Midle has also developed a proof-of-humanity feature that will work as an extra layer to make anti-bot campaigns safer. \u201cThe need for more corporate, measurable and sustainable platforms in the field of Web3 marketing is increasing day by day,\u201d said the Midle team, adding, \u201cIn order not to be left out of the game, all Web3 companies have started to evolve into a more corporate structure.\u201d Speaking hopefully about the future, they added: \u201cEspecially with the inclusion of ETFs and institutional investors in the ecosystem, we will start to see more professional and corporate projects and companies in all areas of Web3.\u201d In the Web3 environment, platforms such as Midle facilitate the transition of businesses to the decentralized ecosystem by offering automated marketing processes, in addition to combating common bot intervention problems. The evolution of such AI-equipped platforms will enable more measurable and sustainable marketing campaigns and will also be instrumental in the long-term success of Web3 initiatives.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Business, #AI, #Marketing, #Web3, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Apr 04, 2024","summary":"","author":"Turner Wright","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/binance-law-nigeria-adjourned-april","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Binance exec\u2019s legal case in Nigeria adjourned until April 19","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Tigran Gambaryan, a United States-based executive for cryptocurrency exchange Binance who faces tax evasion charges in Nigeria, has reportedly had his case adjourned until April 19.

In an attempt to stress how important Bitcoin (BTC) is, it can be easy to take a hard-line \u201cBitcoin Maxi\u201d stance. Bitcoin maximalism is the idea that Bitcoin is the only legitimate cryptocurrency protocol, and that all other protocols have no use cases or utility \u2014 and are simply scams. The other side of the coin is being too lenient with every protocol someone dreams up. Founders always tout some coin or token with some kind of shiny buzzword attached to it to make it sound like a technological revolution. Or a memecoin that will fly to the moon. Having extensive experience as an emerging technology engineer, along with my experience with Bitcoin, Web3, and cryptocurrencies, I can't throw the baby of newer protocols out with the proverbial bathwater of being a Bitcoin maxi. Seeing the innovations and applications of newer protocols served as the inspiration for my idea of being a \u201cBitcoin Maxi Plus.\u201d Related: Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility The Bitcoin Maxi Plus perspective offers a fresh take on the traditional Bitcoin Maximalist stance. It recognizes Bitcoin\u2019s paramount importance and values other cryptocurrencies\u2019 contributions to advancing blockchain technology and its applications. This perspective is a blend of unwavering faith in Bitcoin\u2019s superiority and its role as the ultimate digital asset, along with an understanding that the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem is crucial in fostering innovation and experimentation. The belief that Bitcoin is the primary digital asset is at the heart of a Bitcoin Maxi Plus. This conviction is rooted in Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched security, decentralization, network effect, and proven track record as a store of value and medium of exchange. It is important to note that this perspective does not diminish the value of other cryptocurrencies but rather highlights Bitcoin\u2019s unique position in the cryptocurrency landscape. Unlike traditional Bitcoin maximalists who may dismiss the utility and innovation within other cryptocurrency projects, a Bitcoin Maxi Plus appreciates the experimentation and development happening across the broader blockchain space. This includes advances in smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and scalability solutions. Keeping an eye on experimentation and potential adoption is in keeping with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s own stance as well. Satoshi himself said in reference to zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs being added to Bitcoin that \u201cIf a solution was found, a much better, easier, more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be possible.\u201d In the event of an SHA-256 meltdown, Satoshi suggested a transition to something stronger. In 2011, Satoshi responded to Mike Hearn\u2019s email by pointing out \u201cother chains to not follow Bitcoin\u2019s rules,\u201d suggesting he knew about the experimentation of others. Satoshi and others from the Bitcoin OG era share the Bitcoin Maxi Plus recognition that Bitcoin can potentially integrate technological advancements, which has been proven in other cryptocurrency projects, such as implementing the Lightning Network for scalability. A Bitcoin Maxi Plus might support or advocate adopting successful innovations into the Bitcoin ecosystem to enhance its functionality. Related: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs By understanding the value of a diverse blockchain ecosystem, a Bitcoin Maxi Plus supports the growth and development of other cryptocurrencies, not as competitors but as complementary technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible with blockchain. This perspective sees the crypto ecosystem as a testing ground for innovations that could benefit Bitcoin directly or indirectly. A Bitcoin Maxi Plus approaches other cryptocurrencies with a crucial but open-minded attitude, recognizing that while many projects may fail or prove unnecessary, the innovation process is valuable. This stance allows for a more inclusive view of cryptocurrency while firmly believing in Bitcoin\u2019s leading role. The journey of cryptocurrency has unfolded through various phases, each distinguished by breakthroughs in technology and an expansion of applications. Bitcoin heralded the first generation. Ethereum (ETH) represented the second generation. Solana (SOL), Near (NEAR), and Avalanche (AVAX) ushered in the third generation. The fourth generation included projects such as Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM). With each generation building on the achievements of its predecessors, the cryptocurrency domain continues to evolve, exploring new frontiers. The sector is abuzz with research into fifth-generation cryptocurrencies, which aim to further bolster security, diminish energy consumption, and facilitate blockchain technology\u2019s integration across diverse economic sectors. The Bitcoin Maxi Plus concept represents a mature and nuanced understanding of cryptocurrency. It bridges steadfast support for Bitcoin and the recognition that a diverse and innovative cryptocurrency ecosystem can significantly contribute to the technology\u2019s evolution and adoption. This perspective not only enriches the discourse within the cryptocurrency community but also advocates for a more collaborative and exploratory approach to the future of blockchain technology.

Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that the number of wallet addresses wallet address holding meme-related tokens for under 30 days hit a record high in March. The analytics platform explained that this indicates a large inflow of new traders buying memecoins in March. The number of traders jumping into the memecoin sector may be attributed to the huge gains displayed by memecoins in the first quarter of 2024. On April 3, coin information tracker CoinGecko dubbed the memecoin sector the \u201cmost profitable crypto narrative\u201d during the year\u2019s first quarter. Memecoins displayed 1,312.6% returns on average, the highest among the top tokens by market capitalization. Projects like Book of Meme (BOME) and Dogwifhat (WIF) drove the percentages up amid the memecoin frenzy. Stories highlighting life-changing gains may have also played a role in attracting traders into the sector. A trader turned $62 into $2 million in December after buying a Solana memecoin. The crypto user caught wind of a memecoin called Silly Dragon (SILLY), which poked fun at Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko\u2019s Halloween costume. More recently, another trader turned $13,000 into $2 million within one hour after buying a meme-based token. On April 3, a crypto trader saw a 15,700% gain after buying a memecoin called Donotfomoew (MOEW) that was minted on the Base network.

On March 15, a trader fumbled potential millions after selling BOME tokens before the prices skyrocketed. The trader bought 170 million BOME for $8,000 and sold the tokens for about $131,000. At the time of writing, BOME trades for about $0.01615, meaning the tokens could have been worth $2.7 million in the current market. Meanwhile, a Solana memecoin project called \u201cCondom\u201d pulled out on investors before its launch.

On April 4, Budi Arie Setiadi, the country\u2019s communication minister, said the center will be worth $200 million and will be located in Surakarta city in the Central Java region. Setiadi said the AI center will host either telecommunication infrastructure or a human resource center. Construction is expected to begin in 2024. According to the mayor of Surakarta, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the city was chosen because of its readiness with human resources and 5G infrastructure. Nvidia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government in January 2022, through which it pledged to train lecturers and over 20,000 university students in AI skills over five years in an effort to boost the nation\u2019s AI talent pool. This was prior to the AI frenzy that ensued after OpenAI released its groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Since the memorandum was signed, the AI market has nearly doubled from $134.89 billion in 2022 to $241.80 billion in 2023, according to recent data. Cointelegraph reached out to Nvidia for additional information on the development in Indonesia.

In Singapore, local telecom company Singtel also partnered with the chipmaker for a new data center, and Nvidia and the Singapore Institute of Technology have also collaborated on a new AI center. Major AI developers such as Google and Microsoft have also been pouring billions of dollars into AI initiatives across the globe, creating data centers and training programs for local communities in places like Germany, France and Spain.

Increased crypto prices and activity have resulted in a surge of applicants and postings on industry job sites. Raman Shalupau, founder of the jobs board CryptoJobsList, told Cointelegraph that there has been 20\u201330% growth month-over-month for the number of companies active. He added that much of the activity is from existing companies surviving the bear market: \u201cI\u2019m not seeing a specific trend of new companies entering the market just yet.\u201d According to Shalupau, hiring in the early phase of a bull run tends to be from existing companies, which in many cases had hiring freezes when the crypto market was in a slump. The next round of hiring comes when new companies begin to seek talent, but this growth tends to arrive deeper in the cycle. Recent: AI token prices soar: Is it all hype, or is there real potential? Shalupau said: \u201cThat usually happens six months in a cycle or so when there is more VC [venture capital] activity when people feel that it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s here. Crypto is here to stay \u2014 again.\u201d \u201cAt least in previous cycles, it also came with the discovery of a new business model or understanding. For example, multichain is the new paradigm \u2014 so we need more analytics tools, right? Etherscan is no longer sufficient, so we need something like Nansen, for example,\u201d added Shalupau. But the new narrative has yet to be discovered at this stage in the bull run. Shalupau points out that exchanges \u2014 one of the largest segments of the crypto market \u2014 are gearing up their hiring efforts significantly. Research by Cointelegraph confirmed that over 1,000 jobs are open across the industry\u2019s most prominent players: Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini. Binance currently has upward of 350 job vacancies, while KuCoin is not far behind it, with 300 vacant positions. Coinbase has almost 200 roles open at present, up from only 70 in December 2023, while Kraken and Gemini are also hiring for around 100 and 50 roles, respectively. Of the 350 roles available at Binance, 50 are entry-level or graduate roles for those without significant work experience, offering an entry point into the industry. Another boon of the bull market, at least for candidates, is that average salaries increase. For example, Shalupau said that in 2024, the average salary for an engineering role is $168,000, compared to $137,000 in 2022 and $135,000 in 2023. With tempting remuneration packages, it\u2019s understandable that the number of applications also increased in March. The top three locations for hiring companies on CryptoJobsList are the United States, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Other hotspots include Hong Kong, India and Canada. If you count \u201cremote\u201d as a location, it comes in second behind the United States. Zara M, head of human resources at Cointelegraph, has also observed an uptick in the market. As lead of the newly relaunched jobs.cointelegraph.com, she says the jobs market is currently very strong. \u201cThe site use increased threefold in March. I can 100% say I can see the difference,\u201d said Zara. Zara said that part of that rapid growth curve may also be due to marketing and increasing awareness since the launch. For this reason, drawing a one-to-one parallel between the growth of Cointelegraph and the market may not be possible. As for the types of roles that are currently in demand, Zara says researchers, product managers and project managers are all highly sought after. With it being a good time to be a candidate in search of work, Zara advised jobseekers to \u201cunderstand themselves and what they want from their career.\u201d Recent: Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations \u201cInstead of applying to 10,000 different jobs per day, it\u2019s really valuable to understand what they want in their future and what they want to do,\u201d she said. Shalupau similarly advised all parties to be cautious and to do their full due diligence before accepting a role or offering a contract. Most importantly, job seekers were advised to remember how fast things can change in crypto. \u201cBe aware that the bull market is not here forever,\u201d added Shalupau \u2014 reminding everyone to make hay while the sunshine lasts.","tags":"#Business, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #Job"},{"date":"Apr 04, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/ripple-announces-stablecoin-launch","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Ripple to launch US dollar stablecoin, aims to compete with USDT and USDC","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"XRP issuer Ripple has announced plans to launch a United States dollar-backed stablecoin and hopes to compete with Circle and Tether for a slice of the market share over the next five years. Cointelegraph spoke to Ripple chief technology officer David Schwartz ahead of the announcement, which outlines plans for the stablecoin that will initially be issued on the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that the question you ask, we don\u2019t have an answer to yet. What\u2019s the ticker going to be, and what we\u2019re going to call it? You\u2019re just going to have to call it the Ripple stablecoin for now,\u201d Schwartz said during a video call. Related: Ripple \u2018would certainly welcome\u2019 an XRP ETF: Brad Garlinghouse Ripple has been toying with the idea of launching a stablecoin for over a year, and Schwartz believes the existing stablecoin ecosystem is not as diverse and robust as it could be. Pinning the stablecoin market\u2019s current value at $150 billion, Schwartz said there\u2019s room for another big player: \u201cWe think it will be over $2 trillion by 2028, and there\u2019s only two market leaders. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner-take-all-all ecosystem, particularly on the DeFi side.\u201d Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar, and the company plans to back the tokens with U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasurys and \u201cother cash equivalents.\u201d Schwartz said that Ripple would look to emulate Circle\u2019s focus on compliance and likely aim to compete against the USD Coin (USDC) issuer: \u201cOur angle is going to be very \u2018compliance-first.\u2019 We\u2019re very transparent about how the assets are backed, so we\u2019re kind of going to be directly competing against USDC.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re looking to grab market share. We\u2019re not looking to finesse a couple of extra decimal points by taking risks with other people\u2019s money,\u201d Schwartz added when queried over Ripple\u2019s plans to back the stablecoin with dollar deposits, U.S. Treasurys and cash equivalents. The reserve assets are set to be audited by a third-party accounting firm, and Ripple will publish monthly attestations. Schwartz drew comparisons to the early days of Tether\u2019s (USDT) stablecoin, where critics often sounded the alarm over the potential of the issuer to steal funds and the credibility of its reserve attestations. \u201cInitially when Tether first launched, a big concern was whether these guys would run off with all the money because they\u2019re very incentivized to do that. Then, after a while, \u2018you\u2019re like, wait a minute, these guys have a long-term business,\u2019\u201d Schwartz said. The Ripple chief technology officer added that the reality of launching a new stablecoin that could attract hundreds of millions, billions, or tens of billions of dollars would lead to these types of concerns. The company is leaning on its credibility, track record in the space and strong balance sheet to squeeze its way into the stablecoin market. \u201cI think we have a credible claim to be in the conversation near the top. If at the end of two years, we\u2019re number three, but the market has grown to 10 times what it is today, that\u2019s still pretty good,\u201d Schwartz said. Cointelegraph also queried why Ripple was interested in a stablecoin offering while XRP (XRP) continues to be positioned as the token for its real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network primarily catering to financial institutions. Schwartz says that Ripplenet serves non-bank payment companies using XRP for transparent payments. However, there are some markets that these firms cannot get into using XRP or supplement liquidity.

The introduction of a Ripple stablecoin is also set to complement the ecosystem\u2019s recently launched automated market maker. Schwartz says the stablecoin will provide liquidity and capture volatility and arbitrage opportunities between multiple assets.

The United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has secured restricted dealer licenses in Canada, doubling down on global expansion amid regulatory crackdown at home. Coinbase has obtained a new license in Canada, becoming registered in Ontario as a restricted dealer under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the firm officially announced on April 3. The new authorization officially established Coinbase as a legally operating cryptocurrency firm in Canada. \"The registration is the culmination of months of hard work, starting in March 2023 when we signed an Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking that signified our dedication to regulatory compliance and operational excellence,\" the announcement notes According to CSA\u2019s national registration data, there are two Coinbase-related entities registered in Canada, including Coinbase Incorporated, which is registered as a restricted dealer. The other one, Coinbase Canada, is registered as an international dealer. According to CSA, restricted dealer registration is \u201ca special kind of dealing registration used for firms that do not quite fit under any other category.\u201d Regulators establish individual requirements for firms with this status. International dealers are not allowed to trade with Canadian customers in equity or debt securities of Canadian issuers other than government issuers, according to legal intelligence source JD Supra. Coinbase\u2019s new license in Canada is not the first big move by the crypto exchange in the country.

Kraken filed in March 2023 a pre-registration undertaking with the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada seeking restricted dealer status as well. The move aimed to help Kraken comply with the CSA\u2019s new guidance for crypto asset trading platforms issued in February 2023. According to the new requirements, local crypto trading platforms should comply with stricter custody standards, restrictions on the use of leverage and a ban on trading stablecoins without prior written consent from the CSA.

Studies say that NFT sales are mostly driven by a combination of luck, scarcity and optimism, implying room for improvement to make them more resilient to market conditions. Unlike other blockchain-based assets, NFTs have their own challenges on top of the common issues troubling the broader Web3 ecosystem. Despite their popularity and the vast range of uses \u2014 from art to gaming to digital identities \u2014 NFTs face significant hurdles impacting user experience and adoption.  A hybrid approach that combines the strength of the two most common token standards \u2014 the ERC-20 and ERC-721 \u2014 has the potential to effectively address the NFT challenges, primarily the ones regarding fractionalization and liquidity. While there are already some experiments on the topic, these efforts still need to figure out how to deal with the ever-rising transaction costs of networks based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This is where HybridX emerges with its gas-efficient hybrid token, HX, combining the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. The unique blend introduced by HybridX aims to harness the strengths of both standards to offer efficiency and flexibility in the trading and management of digital assets of the broader Web3 ecosystem. The hybrid HX token model allows for the fractionalization of NFTs to increase market liquidity, enabling users to buy and sell portions of NFT assets. The fractionalized NFTs can potentially become more accessible and appealing as digital asset investments for a wider demographic.  On top of addressing the liquidity and fractionalization issues plaguing the NFT market, the first project on HybridX \u2014 XDragon \u2014 has selected the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as its infrastructure primarily due to its capabilities that enhance the project\u2019s features. ICP\u2019s on-chain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) allows for the truly random generation of NFT artworks upon conversion from fungible tokens, a contrast to the sequential allocation common in most NFT collections. The on-chain VRF ensures that each NFT acquired is a surprise, enriching the user experience with genuine uniqueness. Additionally, ICP facilitates the on-chain storage of all NFT metadata, a move that eliminates the need for off-chain components and bolsters the security and integrity of the data. The hybrid token model integrates with DeFi and NFT platforms for enhanced composability. NFT holders can leverage their assets through the HX token in various DeFi applications. HybridX also offers flexible management of NFT collections. Users can selectively sell or burn assets without being constrained by current standards\u2019 first-in-first-out (FIFO) restrictions. This allows tokenholders to take a strategic approach to their portfolios. The innovative approach to NFTs has already established use cases to demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of HX, including the Web3-powered Dragon Eyes dice-rolling game. Dragon Eyes introduces the XDragon as a switchable NFT to memecoin. Users can shapeshift their fungible EYES token, the reward token of the game, to mint an Xdragon NFT. The game applies a 1% fee distributed back to the NFT holders through pool fee distribution and gamification. The shapeshift fee is directly proportional to the token price, providing fundamental value and utility for XDragon. XDragon will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can be used to enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain. XDragon Gamblification Economy XDragon collection is designed to be self sustained through gamblification and shapeshift fee distribution.

The expansions include exclusive NFTs for HybridX members, the CrossPollinate program for incentivizing ecosystem projects, a launchpad powered by NFTs and a DEX for both fungible and nonfungible tokens. As the blockchain-based internet continues to expand and evolve, HybridX envisions a fluid future of digital assets \u201cwhere the values are seamlessly discovered and exchanged, fostering innovation and accessibility in the evolving Web3 economy.\u201d","tags":"#Blockchain, #Adoption, #ERC-20, #Web3, #NFT"},{"date":"Apr 04, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/web3-player-centric-games-mass-adoption-websea","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Web3 needs player-centric games for mass adoption \u2014 Websea exec","type":"Blog","category":"Interview","content":"Web3 gaming needs more player-centric projects with smooth onboarding to bolster mainstream adoption, according to Herbert Sim, chief operating officer of the hybrid cryptocurrency exchange Websea.

Mullin breaks down the hype, explores the true potential for investors, and discusses the challenges faced by the emerging technology. Mullin explains what tokenization means for Web3 adoption and its potential to increase institutional investments, as well as highlighting the state of regulations in the RWA space and what that means for Web3 projects. The CEO says that the hype around real-world assets is not new to the blockchain industry and is similar to the popularity of security token offerings (STO) during the 2018\u20132019 cycle. Mullin says RWA tokenization is taking off because there is more interest from institutions, and projects are finding ways around regulatory issues, which previously impeded the STO sector. Mullin takes a more nuanced approach to whether everything needs to be tokenized or not. He explains that anyone can tokenize almost anything, but whether that token grants real-world rights is a separate issue. To create a truly transferable token, projects must merge the technology and token creation with real-world ownership, corporate actions and legal status, Mullins states. This allows projects to mirror and grant the transferable rights of the real-world product in token form. Mullin quickly points out that this is a challenge because every asset class has different real-world rules, which vary by jurisdiction. Depending on where the project operates, it must consider different things, making it a challenging yet rewarding industry and product suite. \u201cAnd I think that in the longer term, tokenization, everything will be tokenized, in my opinion. I think the whole world will be tokenized. My personal perspective is if Web2 was bringing the world online, Web3 is bringing the world on-chain.\u201d Mullin adds that the tokenization of real-world assets will likely attract more institutional interest than the space has experienced. He adds that RWA tokenization allows institutions to invest on-chain without dealing with unfamiliar and more volatile assets, such as those in decentralized finance.

On April 4, GSR reportedly secured the license after receiving an in-principle approval in October 2023. GSR Singapore CEO Xin Song claimed that GSR is the first of its kind to receive the MPI license in the country. MPI-licensed companies in Singapore are authorized to conduct multiple payment services and exceed volume limitations for payment firms. Licensed companies can exceed the 3 million Singapore dollars ($2.2 million) volume limit for a payment service and the monthly limit of 6 million SG$ ($4.4 million) for two or more payment services. In the case of GSR, the license would allow the company to conduct its over-the-counter (OTC) spot and market-making services under the purview of Singapore\u2019s central bank. The company was founded in the United States in 2013 and facilitates OTC crypto trading, derivatives, market making and venture capital investments. It also holds money service business licenses across several states in the United States. Singapore\u2019s regulatory efforts allow financial institutions to explore blockchain-based technologies to position the country as a digital asset hub. As a result, many crypto companies targeting the region have pushed to acquire the MPI license to offer their services within the country. In 2023, Crypto.com, Coinbase and Ripple received formal approval for their MPI licenses in Singapore. Crypto.com obtained its license in June, while Ripple and Coinbase received an official nod in October. In 2024, crypto exchange OKX and crypto custodian BitGo received in-principle approvals for the MPI license in Singapore. BitGo received the initial nod in January, while OKX received its initial approval in March.

In doing so, the cryptocurrency has outperformed most of its market rivals, namely Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), whose gains in the same period sit around 0.64% and 0.22%, respectively. Among the top catalysts driving the BNB's price rally on April 4 include the ongoing euphoria around the launch of synthetic dollar protocol, Ethena (ENA), and its rising crypto market dominance. On March 29, Binance announced the inclusion of Ethena on the Binance Launchpool, noting that users could stake their BNB (and FDUSD) to farm ENA tokens from March 30 until April 1. The crypto exchange listed the ENA token for trading on April 2. Related: Wormhole, Ethena and Waves are top 3 \u2018trending\u2019 tokens right now: Santiment This period coincided with a slight increase in the total-value-locked (TVL) across the BNB Chain, as shown in the Defi Llama chart below. In other words, the ability to farm ENA tokens by staking BNB spurred increased buying and holding activities, leading to price gains. BNB price rallied similarly around the cross-chain gaming platform Portal (PORTAL) 's launch on the Binance Launchpool in February. The euphoria around Ethena further coincides with BNB's rising crypto market dominance, indicating a rise in capital inflows to its market compared to its rivaling assets. Notably, the BNB Dominance Index (BNB.D) has risen approximately 6.5% from its recent lows on April 2. The latest surge in BNB's market share mirrors the notable expansion seen in other leading altcoins like Solana and Ether, predominantly against Bitcoin, which commands nearly half of the market's total value. For instance, the widely-tracked BNB/BTC pair has rallied 7.6% since April 2 to reach a two-week high of 0.00887 BTC on April 4. BNB's price surge further takes cues from the BNB Chain's strategic expansion into the memecoin market, a move seemingly inspired by the rapid network growth observed in its competitor Solana network within the same niche. BNB Chain has announced a commitment of up to $1 million in rewards for developers who launch their memecoin projects on its network, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph on April 2. Since then, BNB's price has gained 2%. Such strategic investments can potentially drive BNB's utility and demand, given that it plays a central role in transaction fees, governance, and participation in new projects within the BNB Chain network. BNB's gains today are part of a rebound move that started after testing its prevailing bull pennant's lower trendline, as shown below. The price eyes a run-up toward the pennant's upper trendline, and will likely consolidate inside its triangle-shaped area in the coming days. However, since bull pennants are considered bullish continuation patterns, BNB's likelihood of breaking out toward $950, up about 65% from current prices, should be higher by June. The upside target is the sum of BNB's breakout level (in this case, it is considered at the pennant's apex point) and the height of its previous uptrend. Related: BNB\u2019s 12% weekly surge: peaking or just getting started? On the other hand, the bull pennant pattern will risk invalidation if BNB price decisively breaks below its lower trendline. This would shift focus to the 50-day and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), marked by red and blue waves, respectively, located at $500 and $360 that should serve as potentially strong support zones.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday, April 4, in a federal court in New York, according to an April 4 Bloomberg report. The scam apps were designed to look like genuine digital asset investments aiming to persuade users to deposit their funds, which users could never withdraw.

The discussion revolved around bitsCrunch - a decentralized, AI-powered data network for NFTs and other public chain digital assets recognized by PwC and Ernst & Young. Its partners include Mastercard, Unstoppable Domains, DappRadar, and other key players in the industry. Pravin began the interview by elaborating on bitsCrunch\u2019s mission to democratize access to blockchain data: \u201cBlockchain data is quite tricky and not human readable, which is why there are many tools and protocols in the space. We want to make this data accessible to both companies and individual users.\" The platform is already user-friendly: anyone can access Bitscrunch\u2019s data APIs with a valid internet connection and an API key, which can be generated instantly or within 48 hours. \"The moment you get access, you can start querying data, making API calls, and building your own dashboards,\" Pravin continued. \u201cWe plan to make the whole experience easier, especially for non-techy people, like adding drag-and-drop interfaces.\u201d The company differentiates itself by offering forensic analysis in addition to traditional analytics. This would involve identifying suspicious activity within the broader blockchain ecosystem, going beyond the NFT focus. In addition, Bitscrunch also offers insights into in-game analytics, providing data on player behavior and in-game asset trading. This type of data can be invaluable to gaming companies looking to understand and target their audience. bitsCrunch also has an impressive library of historical data. \u201cJust to give you an example, we can provide prices of up to 250,000 tokens on Ethereum since its inception. Or tell you the price of Chainlink on any given day. Very few players can do that,\u201d Pravin pointed out, comparing to established data providers like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. When discussing their token BCUT, bitsCrunch also doesn\u2019t go for hype and is more interested in building a functional network. \u201cWe believe in slow and steady growth,\u201d the speaker noted. The bitsCrunch network will rely on node operators to distribute the data load, similar to how services like Amazon and Google work. BCUT tokenholders can participate by delegating their tokens to these node operators, which allows them to choose operators who offer the best value to the network. The results have been promising so far. According to Pravin, in just one month, over 4.22 million BCUT tokens have been staked on the Bitscrunch network mainnet. Additionally, 48 leading node operators, including industry heavyweights like 0xFury, Nodes.Guru and Impossible Finance are already contributing to the network. In the near future, staking will be open to the public. \u201cWe\u2019re big fans of existing solutions like Graph Protocol and Covalent,\u201d Pravin said about the inspiration for the BCUT token. \u201cSuch data protocols usually follow Delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) algorithms and sets of node operations. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with, we don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel since it has already been tested on the market. Instead, we want to focus on our core competencies \u2013 data analytics, AI, and machine learning,\u201d he added. Bitscrunch is taking a big step toward DAO status by launching the \u201cContributor\u201d role. This program allows the community to actively participate in the development of the network and earn perks. \u201cWe want the community to come in, contribute, and then be rewarded for their work,\u201d said Pravin. The first opportunity to contribute is through asset labeling, which allows users to identify wallet types and their origins. These labels are then verified internally, and all contributors are rewarded on-chain through a transparent system powered by Chainlink\u2019s oracles. The next step in community engagement is the \u201cIndicator\u201d role. Currently, the Bitscrunch team decides which blockchains to index, which algorithms to use, and which data analytics to share publicly. However, the future vision is for the community to have a say in these decisions. The ultimate goal for bitsCrunch is to be a comprehensive data hub, not just for NFT information, but to be the destination for all things blockchain data. Pravin gave a glimpse of what\u2019s to come, such as the addition of some major blockchains and potential exchange listings. \u201cThe next big integration and transition to a more decentralized operator model is exciting,\u201d he concluded.","tags":"#Blockchain, #DAO, #Games, #NFT"},{"date":"Apr 04, 2024","summary":"","author":"Arijit Sarkar","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/ape-coin-dao-favor-ape-top-level-domains","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"ApeCoin DAO gives thumbs up to .APE top-level domains","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Update March 4, 10:40 UTC: This article has been updated to include interview responses from D3 co-founder and CEO Fred Hsu. The ApeCoin community unanimously approved a proposal to register \u201c.APE\u201d as a new top-level domain (TLD) with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the world\u2019s authority on IP addresses and domain names. In line with ICANN\u2019s plan to implement new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) by the second quarter of 2026, the ApeCoin decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) proposed working with Web3 domains specialist D3 to create the .APE TLD as a real-world asset (RWA). A majority (91.68%) of the ApeCoin community voters did so in favor of the proposal, while 8.32% voted against it. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Fred Hsu, co-founder and CEO of D3, said that DNS domains it offers and intends to register with ICANN are inter-operable, i.e. can be used for Web1 (email/web), Web2 (apps/social) and Web3. According to the proposal, D3 will lead the effort to prepare and submit the application, which is expected to take approximately one year to be readied. Additionally, D3 also plans to offer Ape-linked name tokens as an immediate Web3 identifier for users. Hsu\u2019s vision for D3 includes bridging over 5 billion Web2 users to Web3 through domains. \u201cNot much has changed in the past 20 years with traditional domains, so we\u2019re aiming to revolutionize both domain ownership and usage,\u201d he added. Hsu said that the .APE domains, once launched, will have the potential to generate multi-million dollars in annual revenue. \u201cDomains serve as both a vital piece of digital real estate and a source of recurring revenue,\u201d he explained. As part of the deal, the gross revenues generated from the Ape name tokens and the .APE TLDs will be split 50/50 between ApeCoin DAO and D3. The proposal clarified that \u201cowning\u201d a TLD is not possible. Instead, \u201cICANN contractually grants the rights to exclusively operate and monetize each TLD that automatically renews every 10 years.\u201d As shown above, the total costs involved for the initiative is three million ApeCoin (APE). D3 will incur ongoing technical and operational costs related to managing the .APE namespace, with contributions from ApeCoin DAO for co-marketing to the masses.

FCA Executive Director Sheldon Mills said in a statement: \u201cThe new Digital Securities Sandbox reshapes how we regulate by allowing firms to test regulatory changes using real-world situations before these changes are made permanent. We hope this will be a more effective, collaborative and quicker way of delivering regulatory change.\u201d The initiative, which is to take place over five years, could pave the way for establishing permanent regulations governing the trading and settlement of digital assets down the line. The U.K. Treasury first started consultations on the DSS in July 2023. Subsequently, the U.K. government said it would enact legislation to implement the initiative by November 2023. Related: UK regulations will allow stablecoins and CBDCs to coexist, says former BoE fintech lead Following this, the government introduced new regulations in December 2023, offering the nation\u2019s financial regulators guidelines for overseeing the sandbox. These regulations took effect on Jan. 8 as part of the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. After releasing the joint consultation paper, interested parties can now provide feedback until May 29. Subsequently, the BOE and FCA will review the feedback and open applications by the summer, with the first applicants joining the initiative by the autumn. According to the regulators, the DSS will welcome a diverse array of firms, aiming to optimize learning opportunities and foster innovation within the U.K. financial system. This inclusive approach could facilitate quicker and more cost-effective methods for trading, settling and utilizing securities among financial market participants.

Lido\u2019s popularity in ETH staking, coupled with the lack of competition in the space, allowed the platform to earn the lion\u2019s share of the ETH staking market. The community feared that any entity representing over 33% of the market could influence various aspects of the Ethereum blockchain. As of April 4, data from crypto analytics platform Dune shows that Lido\u2019s market share for staked ETH dipped below 30%. Other prominent entities contributing to the ETH staking ecosystem are crypto exchanges Coinbase (14.04%) and Binance (3.75%) and Ethereum staking platform Kiln (3.5%). However, the second-largest entity in ETH staking is marked as \u201cunidentified,\u201d which currently represents 16.9% of the market. There are 26 known entities that contribute to ETH staking in total, including crypto exchanges Kraken (2.4%), Bitcoin Suisse (1.6%), OKX (1.2%) and Upbit (1.1%). According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, stake pools should not have more than 15% control and should choose to \u201ckeep increasing its fee rate until it goes back below 15%.\u201d The Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) community previously tried to solve the ETH staking dominance issue by proposing a hard limit in May 2022. However, the DAO rejected the proposal with a 99.81% vote in June 2022. Increasing competition among ETH staking service providers is expected to play a major role in further decentralizing the staking ecosystem.

Burkey\u2019s account has since been made private. The W token officially launched on April 3 at a price of $1.66 on the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) OpenBook, commanding a total market capitalization of $2.98 billion at launch. The token\u2019s price has since fallen 19.5% and is currently trading at $1.34. The bridging protocol set aside 674 million tokens \u2014 6.75% of the total supply \u2014 for the airdrop, meaning that the current total value of the airdrop stands at $896 million for users who met the protocol\u2019s eligibility requirements.

Its venture arm, Galaxy Ventures, typically used company money for investments but decided to open up its new Galaxy Ventures Fund I to other venture capitalists last year, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, per an April 4 report. The minimum investment it\u2019ll make into startups is $1 million, the person added. The fund would allow Galaxy to \u201ccontinue fueling the digital asset ecosystem by backing promising early-stage companies,\u201d Galaxy told Bloomberg. Galaxy Ventures\u2019 investments in crypto startups include a $2.7 million February round it led for Citrea, a project aiming to bring zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) to Bitcoin. Galaxy has raised and contributed to other funds. Its most recent contribution was to a $75 million fund to VC firm 1kx targeting crypto-based consumer apps.

Bitcoin Cash is a proof-of-work blockchain network and cryptocurrency that was designed to be faster and cheaper to use than Bitcoin (BTC). The first Bitcoin Cash halving event took place on April 8, 2020, with miner rewards dropping from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH. There has been speculation in the lead-up to the halving, with the price of Bitcoin Cash increasing 147.85% over the past three months and 24% over the past 30 days. However, in the day leading up to the halving, Bitcoin Cash's price dipped by 9.94%, falling to $572.21, as per CoinMarketCap data. However, after the halving, it quickly bounced back, reaching $604, a spike of approximately 5.5%. The recent price decline led to liquidations totaling $3.9 million, predominantly affecting long positions at $3.3 million, while short positions accounted for $569,540, as per CoinGlass data. On March 29, Cointelegraph reported that open interest (OI) in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts reached all-time highs of $708.75 million. At the time of publication, the OI has continued its ascent, surging even further to $799.23 million. Meanwhile, one X user \"DavidShares\" explained to his 17,500 followers that many miners had already switched over to mining Bitcoin ahead of the halving. He also noted that hash rates have declined since the halving. The network has now validated 840,004 blocks, indicating just four blocks have been validated since the halving event, as per Bitcoin Unlimited data. In 2017, Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin due to a group of the community disagreeing over ways of scaling up and decreasing transaction fees to adjust for the growing demand. Related: Memecoin madness is breaking the Bitcoin halving cycle Just two years later, it split again which led to controversy amongst the mining community as several had not upgraded to the new chain, resulting in a wasteful allocation of resources.

DOGE price has dropped over 5.5% over the last 24 hours to an intraday low of $0.1712 on April 3, underperforming the crypto market, which fell by around 0.17% in the same period. The memecoin\u2019s price followed a correction in Bitcoin (BTC) that has witnessed nearly a 7.7% retreat in the last two days. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the most likely reasons behind Dogecoin\u2019s latest pullback. DOGE has posted tremendous gains recently, rising more than 11% between March 23 and March 28. The price then turned down on March 29 and currently trades 5.5% below its value a week ago. DOGE\u2019s decline over the last seven days also coincides with a drop in futures open interest (OI). Data from Coinglass shows that DOGE OI has fallen by 27.6% from $2.21 billion on March 28 to the current value of $1.60 billion. Additionally, the funding rate for Dogecoin perpetual futures contracts had reduced from 0.107% to 0.021% over the same time period. Reducing funding rates and OI suggest that traders are generally bearish about the asset\u2019s next direction, expecting prices to go lower. This negative sentiment can lead to more selling pressure, potentially lowering the asset\u2019s price if other market conditions align. This seems to be the case with DOGE\u2019s downward move today. Related: Second phase of crypto bull market about to start, says on-chain analyst After the latest marketwide correction that saw millions of dollars liquidated, DOGE sank as low as $0.1712 and is currently 5% down on the weekly timeframe. However, the uptick in whale activity marks a bearish signal for Dogecoin. Whale transactions are large transactions that involve the transfer of $100,000 or more worth of DOGE. According to on-chain data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of DOGE transactions worth between $100,000 and $1 million has increased by more than 20% over the past seven days. Similarly, the data also shows that the number of DOGE transactions larger than $1 million has increased by more than 200% in the last 30 days. In an April 1 post on X market intelligence firm, Santiment shared the following chart saying, \u201cThe top #memecoin by market cap (#8 market cap #crypto asset overall) is being powered by major dormant whales moving $DOGE back into circulation.\u201d This increase in dormant whale activity shows the long-term holders are now in profit after March\u2019s rally in DOGE price and are now cashing in, validating the ongoing correction. Dogecoin\u2019s drop today precedes a period of growing bearish divergence between its price and the relative strength index (RSI). Notably, DOGE\u2019s price rallied between March 28 and March 31, forming higher lows. But, in the same period, its daily RSI dropped, forming lower lows. As a rule of technical analysis, a divergence between rising prices and falling RSI indicates weakness in the prevailing uptrend, prompting traders to secure profits at local price highs.

From the Tulip Mania to Slerf, there's been no shortage of investments that promise to make one rich overnight. However, there might be a more effective investing strategy when the risk to award is considered. Timing plays a pivotal role in investment decisions, yet achieving precision in this aspect can be quite challenging. A more conservative approach that has proven to be one of the most effective investing strategies is dollar-cost averaging (DCA). DCA involves regularly purchasing a fixed dollar amount of an asset over time. The strategy aims to reduce volatility by spreading out buy orders. This approach allows for some purchases at lower prices and others at higher prices, making it attractive for assets with notable volatility, such as Bitcoin (BTC). Investing $50 weekly, or $200 a month, in Bitcoin from July 2019 would yield substantial returns, reaching 345.9% by January 2024. Despite an initial investment totaling just over $13,000, the total value would soar to $58,193. In contrast, investing in gold during the same period would result in a modest return of 24.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) generated less than 1% more than the most precious metal in the world. Meanwhile, Apple stock has seen a notable increase of 64.4% over the same timeframe, with the total DCA strategy value reaching $21,400. However, it's important to note that Bitcoin's volatility has been significantly higher compared to traditional assets. For instance, between 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin's closing price surged to $46,387 by Dec. 31, 2021, marking an astonishing 543.1% increase. Yet, this meteoric rise was accompanied by a sharp decline of over 65% from November 2021 to November 2022, underscoring the extreme fluctuations inherent in the cryptocurrency market. The unpredictable nature of Bitcoin's price recovery, coupled with its inherent volatility, may have made it more daunting for investors to maintain their positions during the specified period. While DCA can be effective, it relies heavily on the investor's conviction in the chosen asset. Related: Dollar-cost averaging or lump sum: Which Bitcoin strategy works best regardless of price? Dollar-cost averaging might be well-suited for new investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and navigate the often volatile landscape of crypto. By investing a fixed amount, such as $50 weekly, regardless of market conditions, investors can effectively spread out their purchases over time. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of short-term price fluctuations and volatility, allowing investors to benefit from the long-term growth potential of the asset. In comments to Cointelegraph, Daniel Masters, chairman at CoinShares said, \u201cWith levels of annualized volatility implied at 75% or so, we know the price path of BTC will see many short-term highs and lows. Dollar-cost averaging is a stress-free way to accumulate a position reflecting a range of short-term market conditions, including cheap and expensive, and avoiding too much risk concentration at a single moment in time.\" For new investors looking to enter the world of investing, DCA offers a straightforward and simplified approach. Instead of attempting to time the market and make large lump-sum investments, which can be daunting and risky, DCA allows investors to steadily build their positions over time. The optimal BTC investing strategy depends mainly on the risk tolerance of the investor, yet DCA might be a good way to accumulate BTC during the next bull market.

According to Gryphon, the move was necessary since Sphere could not pay roughly $30 million in future breach of contract judgments. Sphere 3D, on the other hand, claims to have $45 million in assets and $5 million in liabilities, per its 2023 Annual Report. \u201cA judgment of even $30 million could be rendered against Sphere tomorrow and it would have the means to pay,\u201d reads the document. The company also accused Gryphon of unreasonably multiplying the proceedings, including through counterclaims later dropped. As a result of the market downturn, crypto miners endured a tough winter between 2022 and 2023. According to a source familiar with the litigation, Gryphon\u2019s move to get $10 million from Sphere might be related to its own financial difficulties. \u201cSince April of 2023, it\u2019s been back and forth [...] They [Gryphon] have $18 million in assets, and $27 million in liabilities, which means they have $9 million of negative working capital [...] And on top of that, it looks like from their loan agreement, every single amount of excess income that they generate has to go to pay down their loans with Anchorage,\u201d noted the source. Before their legal dispute, Gryphon and Sphere were bound by a Master Service Agreement (MSA) since 2021, in which Gryphon served as the exclusive provider of management services for Sphere\u2019s blockchain and cryptocurrency operations. Gryphon managed certain digital assets for Sphere, selling them as instructed by the company. The relationship eroded in April 2023, when Sphere initiated legal action against Gryphon following an alleged spoofing incident that resulted in the unauthorized transfer of 26 Bitcoin (BTC) to a malicious actor. Gryphon contended it was the victim of Sphere\u2019s \u201cgross negligence,\u201d blaming them for the security breach. Furthermore, Gryphon alleges Sphere breached the contract by entering into four hosting agreements without Gryphon\u2019s consent. Sphere contends that under the MSA, and through independent discussions with Gryphon, it was allowed to enter contracts with third parties. Sphere also argues that any breaches it committed were minor \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d and do not justify the large damages Gryphon is seeking. Related: Sphere 3D\u2019s legal issues escalate as Gryphon seeks to block $10M Sphere is also seeking damages exceeding $25 million from Gryphon, under claims of failure to file a proof of claim in Core Scientific\u2019s bankruptcy case. Sphere provided $35 million in deposits to Core for hosting services, but only rendered about $1 million in services. After Core declared bankruptcy, Sphere eventually settled with Core for $10 million in reorganized equity. A critical issue for Sphere was the contract that Gryphon entered with Core. This led to a complex situation where Core argued Sphere was not directly involved, complicating Sphere\u2019s efforts to recover its deposits. This situation was further exacerbated by Gryphon\u2019s failure to file a proof of claim in Core\u2019s bankruptcy case by the set deadline.

BRETT recorded the highest returns of 7,727.6% by the end of Q3 2024, followed by Dogwifhat (WIF), which witnessed a 2,721.2% growth year-to-date after going viral amid the Solana-based memecoin frenzy. CoinGecko analyst Lim Yu Qian said: \u201cNotably, the memecoin narrative was 4.6 times more profitable than the next best-performing crypto narrative of tokenized real-world assets (RWA), and 33.3 times more profitable than the layer 2 narratives with the lowest returns in Q1 this year.\u201d Related: Ethereum earnings tripled in Q1 2024, reaching $370M At the time of publication, the total market capitalization of the memecoin sector is $60.93 billion, accounting for approximately 2.32% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, according to data from CoinGecko. This is a 176.9% increase quarter-on-quarter. This surpasses the market capitalization of many mainstream sectors with significant capital and institutional involvement, such as decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) at $29.98 billion, layer 2s at $32.39 billion, zero knowledge at $18 billion, and real-world assets (RWAs) at $8.5 billion.

As of April 3, the Bitcoin (BTC), BNB (BNB), Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD) balances constituting crypto exchange Binance\u2019s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) surpassed $2.03 billion, compared to their initial balance of $1 billion in January 2022. Similarly, crypto exchange Bitget\u2019s initial $300 million protection fund, launched in November 2022, has since surged to $612 million due to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. In the past year alone, Bitcoin has gained 136% and BNB 79.36% as part of a crypto bull run. While most exchanges have some form of insurance protection for users, only Binance and Bitget have since disclosed their on-chain addresses. In 2019, crypto exchange Huobi, now HTX, announced a 20,000 BTC ($1.32 billion) reserve in an independent address \u201cto cope with extreme security accidents.\u201d It is unclear if the exchange held the balance until now. In addition, the HTX group of companies suffered several exploits last year to the tune of millions of dollars lost. Meanwhile, crypto exchange OKX has a $700 million \u201cRisk Shield\u201d program for user protection, although it is unclear if the amount comprises tokens, stablecoins, fiat funds or all three. Some exchanges, such as Coinbase, only offer insurance based on customers' geographical location and whether their funds are in fiat or crypto. Exchanges may choose not to disclose the on-chain addresses of their holdings for various reasons, such as fear of cybersecurity attacks or, in the case of defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, deception. Last October, former FTX chief technology officer Gary Wang told law enforcement officials that the exchange\u2019s so-called $100 million insurance fund in 2021 was fabricated and never contained any of the exchanges\u2019 FTX Token (FTT). FTX\u2019s insurance fund was designed to protect user losses in case of huge, sudden market movements, and its value was often touted on its website and social media. Likewise, on-chain addresses only reveal part of the story and do not contain information such as an exchange\u2019s off-chain liabilities. Some jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, have since mandated that crypto exchanges provide insurance for users that covers up to 50% of their fiat and crypto assets.

In prepared remarks for an SEC Speaks event on April 3, Grewal claimed that companies in the crypto industry had made \u201cmany creative attempts\u201d to avoid the commission\u2019s jurisdiction by continuing to operate in the United States. He also addressed concerns that the SEC was \u201crecklessly exceeding\u201d its authority or \u201cregulating by enforcement\u201d in lawsuits brought against crypto firms. Grewal pointed to Sam Bankman-Fried as an example of the need for enforcement cases. On March 28, the former FTX CEO was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for defrauding investors of the crypto exchange, including \u201cpeople who were forced to sell their home, their car, or take on a second job to make up for their losses.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that, after the latest in a long and growing string of courts affirming our authority to police the crypto markets, we can move past them and address the very real issues present in this industry that lead to elevated investor risk: fraud, lack of transparency, commingling of assets, conflicts of interest, and lack of oversight, to mention just a few,\u201d said the enforcement director. Related: Coinbase Wallet triumph over SEC allegations is a \u2018giant win\u2019 for DeFi Grewal reiterated that the SEC\u2019s standard for determining what a security is under the Howey test had been \u201cclearly and consistently applied.\u201d He did not specifically address reports that the SEC had been exploring whether to classify Ether (ETH) as a security rather than a commodity under the U.S. Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s purview. \u201cThese are not secret analyses; they are public documents for the whole world to see,\u201d said Grewal. \u201cEven parties that argue in court that their conduct does not implicate the federal securities laws have themselves used the Howey framework internally for years to evaluate crypto offerings.\u201d In March, a Utah judge imposed sanctions on the SEC for acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d in a lawsuit it brought against the firm Debt Box. Many industry participants have pointed to the commission\u2019s seemingly inconsistent approach to enforcement on crypto firms and exchange-traded funds, hinting it could lead to an exodus from the United States. The enforcement director\u2019s comments followed those from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who on April 2 criticized the regulator\u2019s accounting guidelines for institutions looking to custody crypto assets. She and other staff and commissioners will speak at the SEC Speaks event ending on April 3.

The insurance industry is a major market that can benefit from the blockchain revolution. Faced with many challenges, including costs, discerning customers and fraud, the insurance sector has immense potential for a blockchain-powered disruption. According to reports, blockchain can pave the way for a $32.9 billion market for the insurance world by 2031. The distributed and transparent nature of the technology enables a comprehensive, secure and interoperable repository of insurance-related information. This is where the idea of a blockchain-based digital insurance marketplace came to life in Nayms. Nayms facilitates the connection between capital providers and brokers by utilizing segregated accounts established by third-party Sponsors to tailor specific insurance solutions. Sponsors submit detailed business plans, which, upon approval, lead to the issuance of participation tokens. Participation tokens represent a contractual interest in the assets and liabilities of a segregated account and are sold only in Nayms\u2019 matching market, allowing investors to fund the accounts with crypto. The capital raised supports the underwriting of blockchain-specific risks, with insurance contracts crafted using Nayms\u2019 Policy Builder. Nayms oversees the management of claims against these accounts, including via designated third-party administrators, ensuring adherence to underwriting guidelines and policy wordings. Nayms streamlines the process, securely linking capital providers to insurance risks via smart contracts, which automate transactions while maintaining transparency and compliance. Tokenization facilitates easy entry and exit for investors, increasing liquidity and enabling a broader base of participants to share in the risk and rewards. Additionally, Nayms targets blockchain-specific risks, such as those associated with cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians and DeFi smart contracts, which represent billions in uninsured value. Offering crypto-based policies minimizes currency risk for blockchain and crypto businesses while providing traditional coverage types like directors and officers against governance-related liabilities and errors and omissions insurance for professional mistakes. Nayms operates under the regulatory framework of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), the financial watchdog in Bermuda, which was one of the first places to implement a regulatory framework for digital assets. Nayms holds both a Class F license under the Digital Asset Business Act 2018 and a Class IIGB license under the Insurance Act 1978. Registered as a segregated accounts company, Nayms utilizes the legal structure to issue segregated accounts for different risk pools \u2014 each insulated from others \u2014 allowing for precise risk management and operational efficiency. The platform integrates the NAYM governance token to align incentives among marketplace participants, enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s functionality by linking rewards to marketplace performance through staking. While the token incentivizes participation and governance within the platform, it\u2019s distinct from participation tokens used for capitalization in insurance operations. NAYM token offers benefits like staking and voting on governance issues related to the Nayms Liquidity Facility (NLF), which provides primary capital to and liquidity for the secondary market on the Nayms marketplace. The model allows Nayms to blend decentralized finance (DeFi) elements with traditional regulatory compliance, ensuring a secure and innovative insurance marketplace. Using blockchain tokenization, Nayms is working with over 20 partners and a global team with the aim of bringing liquidity to insurance as an asset class, enabling over $1 trillion of alternative capital in digital assets to access this risk.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Cryptocurrencies, #Business, #Marketplace, #Insurance, #Tokens, #Bermuda, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Apr 03, 2024","summary":"","author":"Rakesh Upadhyay","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/price-analysis-4-3-btc-eth-bnb-sol-xrp-ada-doge-avax-shib-ton","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Price analysis 4/3: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, DOGE, AVAX, SHIB, TON","type":"Blog","category":"Price Analysis","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating in an uptrend, indicating a tussle between the bulls and the bears. The bears hold the edge in the near term, as the 14th week of the year has historically seen Bitcoin prices fall by an average of 8.33%, according to Coinglass data. During Bitcoin\u2019s range-bound action, traders are likely to focus on the performance of the spot Bitcoin-exchange traded funds, which have been the primary driver of the price. A comparison may be made with March, which saw a sharp uptick in trading volume. According to data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, spot Bitcoin ETF volume surged from $42.2 billion in February to $111 billion in March. However, the uncertainty increases as Bitcoin halving approaches. Independent analyst Rekt Capital believes the pullback is a part of the pre-halving retrace that resulted in a 38% drop in 2016 and 20% in 2020. What are the important levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. The repeated failure of the bulls to propel the price above $71,770 may have tempted the short-term traders to throw in their towel. That sent the price tumbling below the 20-day exponential moving average ($67,646) on April 2. The 20-day EMA has flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium could tilt in favor of the bears if the price skids below the 50-day simple moving average ($63,098). That could open the doors for a drop to $59,000 and subsequently to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the BTC/USDT pair may stay range-bound for some time. The bulls will have to shove the price above the $71,770 to $73,777 resistance zone to signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend to $80,000. Ether (ETH) tumbled below the 50-day SMA ($3,414) on April 2, opening the doors for a retest of the March 20 low of $3,056. The 20-day EMA ($3,493) has started to turn down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. If the price breaks below $3,056, the selling could pick up, and the ETH/USDT pair may collapse to $2,700. If bulls want to prevent the fall, they will have to push the price back above the moving averages. That will suggest a range-bound action between $3,056 and $3,679. A break and close above $3,679 will indicate that bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then rise to $4,100. BNB (BNB) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($561) on April 2, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening. The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. If the price rises from the current level, it could rise to the downtrend line. Conversely, if the price continues lower and breaks below $535, the next stop is likely to be $495. This level may act as a strong support, but if the bears prevail, the decline could extend to the breakout level of $460. Solana (SOL) fell to the 20-day EMA ($181) on April 2, but the sharp rebound on April 3 shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will again try to overcome the barrier at $205. If they succeed, the SOL/USDT pair could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The pair may rally to $243 and later to $260. However, if the price once again turns down from $205, it will indicate that the bears are fiercely defending the level. That increases the possibility of a drop below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the short-term traders may dump their positions, pulling the pair to the 50-day SMA ($150). XRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the large range between $0.46 and $0.74. The price fell below the uptrend line on April 1, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge. The bulls have not given up and are trying to start a relief rally, which is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.61). If the price turns down from this resistance, the likelihood of a drop below $0.56 increases. The XRP/USDT pair could then slump to $0.52. Instead, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal solid buying at lower levels. The pair could then rise to $0.69 and eventually to $0.74, which remains the key resistance to cross. Sustained selling pressure has pulled Cardano (ADA) to the strong support at $0.57. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend this level. If the price rebounds off the $0.57 level, it is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.64). If the price turns lower from the 20-day EMA, it will increase the possibility of a drop below $0.57. That will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, which could clear the path for a fall to the critical support at $0.46. Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the ADA/USDT pair may consolidate between $0.57 and $0.68 for a while. A rise above $0.68 will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down sharply on April 2 and nosedived below the breakout level of $0.19, signaling that the traders are aggressively booking profits. The DOGE/USDT pair continued lower and slipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.18) on April 3, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. If the buyers push the price back above $0.20, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The bulls will then try to challenge the overhead resistance at $0.23. On the contrary, if the price turns down and maintains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that every minor rally is being sold into. The pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.14). Related: Why is Solana (SOL) price up today? The failure to rise above the downtrend line accelerated selling and Avalanche (AVAX) plunged below the breakout level of $50 on April 2. The selling continued, and the AVAX/USDT pair dropped below the 50-day SMA ($47) on April 3. Buyers are trying to defend the 50-day SMA, but the recovery is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break below the 50-day SMA. The pair could then retest the crucial support at $42. This bearish view will be invalidated on a break and close above the downtrend line. Shiba Inu (SHIB) fell below the 20-day EMA ($0.000028) on April 2, indicating that the bears remain active at higher levels. The SHIB/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.000023), which is likely to act as a solid support. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will attempt to push the pair to $0.000033. A break and close above this level will be the first sign that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.000039. Instead, if the price plummets below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction toward $0.000017. Toncoin (TON) reached the 20-day EMA ($4.63) on April 3, an important level to keep an eye on. If the rebound off the 20-day EMA sustains, it will suggest that traders continue to buy at lower levels. That could keep the TON/USDT pair stuck inside a range between the 20-day EMA and $5.69 for some time. Alternatively, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. That could sink the pair to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.22. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, three years later, one can take a look at just how (financially) committed the company has been, as well as what impact the expansion into virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) has had on Meta\u2019s bottom line ahead of its first-quarter earnings call set for April 24. Meta posted a reported revenue of $134.9 billion in 2023, up nearly 16% over 2022. Its fourth-quarter revenue of $40.1 billion set a company record and beat analysts\u2019 predictions. This would seem to indicate that the pivot toward the metaverse has panned out well for the company, but there are mixed signals to interpret ahead of the next call. While Facebook, the social media app, is doing quite well, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs \u2014 the research division responsible for products such as the Quest VR headset line \u2014 has posted successive year-over-year operating losses totaling around $40 billion since 2021. Essentially, the company\u2019s revenue has come exclusively via Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, its suite of social media and messaging apps. According to a report from UploadVR, Meta has sold approximately 20 million Quest headsets since 2019, as of March 2023. For comparison, Apple sold about 151 million iPhones in 2023 alone while Sony has sold approximately 50 million PlayStation five consoles since 2020, as of December 2023. In Meta\u2019s case, the figures surrounding Reality Labs don\u2019t seem to have phased investors and shareholders. As The Motley Fool recently pointed out, in the same time period that it\u2019s been pouring money into Reality Labs for research and development on the metaverse, it\u2019s also been buying back its own stock at an accelerating pace. The company has returned $92 billion worth of its own shares since 2021 and reportedly had a war chest with $31 billion available for purchases at the end of 2023, with another $50 billion earmarked for further buybacks in February.

Cronje is considered one of the most influential thought leaders in decentralized finance (DeFi). Without mentioning the protocol or its synthetic dollar directly by name, Cronje shared a note about his concerns regarding the risk management behind Ethena Labs, highlighting the issue with funding rates in perpetual futures contracts. In an April 3 X post, Cronje wrote: \u201cWhile things are going great now (because the market is positive and shorting funding rates are positive [because everyone is happy being long]), eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset.\u201d Ethena\u2019s USDe stablecoin yield first caused widespread concerns on Feb. 19, when it launched on public mainnet with a 27.6% annual percentage yield (APY), which was considerably higher than the 20% yield on the failed TerraUSD (UST) on the Anchor protocol, which collapsed in May 2022, erasing tens of billions of dollars of value in a few days. Following the mainnet launch, Ethena Labs\u2019 founder Guy Young told Cointelegraph that the widespread concerns are a sign of a maturing industry with a healthy amount of skepticism, rising from the ashes of the Terra collapse. When asked about the concerns related to funding rates turning negative, Young said it\u2019s not a major concern, highlighting that funding rates only turned negative to below -3% for a week during 2022, which was among the worst years for the crypto market. Ethena also employs other measures for when funding rates turn negative, including an emergency insurance fund and arbitrage mechanics, Guy told Cointelegraph: \u201cThink of this as an exogenous interest rate for the system where if the interest rate is too low, that's just the market telling us that the supply of USDe is too high relative to leverage demands in the system\u2026 So when the interest rate goes low, you'll expect that users will not be coming into the product and they'll be redeeming out of it, and in the process of doing so we have to lift the shorts, which allows funding to fall back to zero or above.\u201d While Anchor protocol\u2019s yield was simply made up, Guy highlighted that USDe\u2019s yield is publicly verifiable and is generated via staking returns and shorting Ether perpetual futures contracts. According to Jae Sik Choi, an analyst at Greythorn Asset Management, Anchor protocol\u2019s artificially inflated yield was unsustainable, unlike the dynamic yield promised by USDe. \u201cWe saw how the real yield on Anchor was actually ~5.81% and it paid out 19.45% which is a cause for disaster as the yield backing the product is less than what it pays out\u2026 There is no mention of 'risk-free\u2019 returns that were promoted in Anchor, as the yield is clearly stipulated and we know where it\u2019s coming from (perpetual futures + stETH).\u201d Related: Ethena becomes highest earning DApp in crypto","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #DeFi, #Terra, #Fantom"},{"date":"Apr 03, 2024","summary":"","author":"Shiraz Jagati","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/ai-token-prices-hype-potential-markets","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"AI token prices soar: Is it all hype, or is there real potential?","type":"Blog","category":"Analysis","content":"The artificial intelligence (AI) token market has been on a remarkable upswing over the last few months, with things reaching a fever pitch last month as trading volumes and market valuations skyrocketed across many exchanges. Data from the crypto platform Bitget revealed that the dedicated AI token zone witnessed an astonishing 400% surge in trading volume throughout February alone, reaching a total market capitalization of over $39 billion. This rapid rise has primarily been fueled by investors piling into AI-centric concepts like Worldcoin (WLD), Livepeer (LPT) and Arkham (ARKM), all of which have seen their prices erupt over the past few months. WLD \u2014 the token associated with Sam Altman\u2019s AI-powered universal basic income project \u2014 traded up around 350% from its listing price in 2023 to over $7 per token in early March. Similarly, since their launch, LPT and ARKM have also posted triple-digit percentage gains of nearly 140% and over 100%, respectively. Moreover, the average market capitalization of AI tokens listed on Bitget expanded by a staggering 77% in February compared to January, with the average daily number of traders also rising by 80% during this period. Between Feb. 15 and 29, the exchange saw AI token trading volumes spike by 480%. Another reason for this enthusiasm can be attributed to the upcoming release of OpenAI\u2019s Sora text-to-video AI model, which seems to have already amassed significant excitement among AI investors and enthusiasts. As things stand, the AI token mania shows no signs of subsiding, especially with industry giants like Nvidia seeing record revenues and profits driven by rising demand for AI computing power. Nvidia\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings of $22.1 billion came in well above expectations, with the AI boom identified as a primary catalyst propelling the company\u2019s latest blockbuster results and further fanning the flames of the AI-crypto craze. While there have been notable developments in AI technology, the space is still in its nascent stages. Can these projects really justify an AI token market capitalization of nearly $40 billion, or is it just hype? According to Calanthia Mei, co-founder of Masa Network, a blockchain platform offering resources for AI developers, the market is currently exhibiting a potent mix of real potential and hype: \u201cI\u2019d encourage everyone looking to enter this market to ask themselves a key question: Is a token truly necessary for this project, and does decentralization play a crucial role in its core focus? Also, where would value ultimately accrue in relation to this token in the long run?\u201d While the current market valuation might seem full of speculative hype, Mei sees immense long-term potential and value in AI technologies. \u201cAI\u2019s presence in crypto is most definitely here to stay,\u201d she concluded. Kevin Heng, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Thailand-based crypto exchange Bitazza, told Cointelegraph that the growth signifies more than short-term excitement, underscoring a transformative shift toward decentralizing AI\u2019s role. Recent: Stablecoin delistings in Europe spell change for crypto exchanges, issuers \u201cWe view these valuations as early yet realistic,\u201d he said, saying that \u201cAI can act as a force multiplier for blockchain enterprises and vice versa.\u201d Others remain unconvinced of the inherent value of AI tokens. In a recent report, Coinbase analyst David Han suggested that AI-related tokens may be more hype than actual value, at least in the short to medium term. While he did acknowledge that some crypto-AI tokens continue to deliver profitable trades, he believes the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem will require more than just decentralizing AI components. In an even harsher critique of the market, chief global strategist for financial services giant Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, Albert Edwards, likened the AI token craze to the many financial bubbles we have witnessed in the past: \u201cEvery bubble has a compelling narrative. The current narrative centers on the anticipation of an AI-driven surge in corporate profits to fully justify the current stratospheric valuations. Those of us who lived through the late 1990s [tech] bubble have heard it all before and roll our eyes skyward.\u201d While the numbers may suggest a significant degree of speculation, many market observers argue there are substantive drivers behind the AI token uproar. Mei said that the \u201cmarket is surging because AI is the foundational technological trend that has defined our generation. By 2030, AI companies are estimated to create over $1 trillion in value. We\u2019re also seeing the vast multitude of AI use cases driving hype, with one of the most valuable being personalized user experiences.\u201d She conceded that there is significant hype surrounding the industry, adding that potential investors should closely evaluate whether the AI token they are investing in has real utility. \u201cIn the end, projects that deliver real value and adoption will thrive, while the overhyped ones will fizzle out.\u201d Toufi Saliba, CEO of HyperCycle \u2014 a blockchain project connecting AI machines \u2014 highlighted the technological developments propelling AI tokens higher, telling Cointelegraph that increased adoption and awareness of AI technologies (as well as research breakthroughs) can be key drivers. \u201cWhether this growth is sustainable in the long term will depend on how effectively projects like HyperCycle, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and other decentralized AI technologies continue to evolve and deliver value to businesses and consumers,\u201d he added. As the AI boom continues to permeate the global tech landscape, the surge in AI-linked crypto tokens presents a peek into the future potential of this burgeoning asset class, especially after it outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s most recent record-breaking rally \u2014 which saw the digital currency reach a valuation of $73,600. Industry experts like Markus Levin, co-founder of blockchain data storage firm XYO Network, believe that AI tokens could play a pivotal role in addressing some of the critical challenges (such as privacy concerns and the ever-increasing demand for computing power) facing the AI industry today. \u201cWe will continue to see more and more use cases fusing together the two industries as both AI systems and blockchain networks continue to grow,\u201d he added. Moreover, investment management firm VanEck believes that crypto-AI tokens could play a crucial role in addressing the issue of digital ownership and data verification, ensuring the integrity and provenance of AI-generated content. Recent: Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations This is particularly crucial as the outputs of generative AI become increasingly indistinguishable from human-created works. Therefore, as the tech landscape continues to evolve and mature rapidly, these tokens stand to emerge as a driving force, unlocking new possibilities and reshaping industries. Whether through the development of decentralized AI marketplaces, secure data verification platforms, or the incentivization of computing power, they offer a peek into a future where innovation in the AI realm knows no bounds.","tags":"#Altcoin, #Decentralization, #Technology, #Investments, #AI, #Tokens"},{"date":"Apr 03, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ray Salmond","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/dmail-co-founder-email-decentralize-protect-data-sovereignty","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Dmail co-founder says email must be decentralized and protect data sovereignty","type":"Blog","category":"Podcast","content":"The crypto market is hot, and prices have been in \u201cup only\u201d mode since the start of the year, but looking at the developments beyond Bitcoin and memecoins, the industry\u2019s focus on decentralization remains intact, and for good reason. Just this week, multiple news outlets reported on a lawsuit against Meta claiming the tech giant allegedly gave Netflix access to Facebook users\u2019 direct messages in exchange for Netflix agreeing to spend up to $150 million in ads in 2017. A separate incident, brought to light on March 30, involves United States telecom giant AT&T automatically resetting millions of customer account passwords after acknowledging a data seller published 73 million AT&T customer records from a data breach that occurred in 2019. As usual, the list of data breaches and instances of misuse of customer and user data goes on and on. Just do a quick Google search to see for yourself. On episode 33 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Ray Salmond and Jonathan DeYoung sit down with Dmail co-founder Daniel James to discuss why everyone needs everything to be decentralized, including email. Spam, phishing emails, and the risk of having one\u2019s personal data either deleted or sold are common concerns shared among email users, and James says that \u201cblockchain really enhances security\u201d as \u201cthere\u2019s no central point of failure that hackers can target.\u201d James added that Dmail prioritizes privacy by encrypting every email, which makes it \u201charder for attackers to compromise email accounts and intercept communications.\u201d The decentralized nature of the service also gives users data sovereignty. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle world. It\u2019s a more moral world where you are not the product. You are actually gaining something from this platform. And that\u2019s really what attracts most people into Web3 initially, is that you do have data sovereignty. For me, the foray into Web3 was mostly about Big Tech essentially becoming the arbiters of truth and really overstepping the mark, getting political and censoring certain things. To me, that\u2019s not the job for Big Tech, regardless of your political affiliation. That should not be happening.\u201d James explained that \u201cemail solves these kinds of problems, but it also brings something completely different to the table. It brings the Web3, the blockchain layer, and the possibilities are endless.\u201d When asked how Dmail or any decentralized platform could supplant Gmail\u2019s dominance, James suggested that the ultimate objective is not to replace Gmail but rather to \u201creplicate\u201d their \u201cfantastic user experience and user interface\u201d while circumventing the \u201cethical concerns.\u201d Related: Google\u2019s inclusion of Bitcoin wallet balances sparks privacy debate James said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful product, the way that it\u2019s built. And if we can replicate the UI [user interface] and UX [user experience], that\u2019s great. But there are ethical concerns. There is the fact that you can be bombarded with unsolicited emails. Your data is not your own. Your storage is not fully decentralized. The revenue streams are essentially the only trickle-down within the company itself. So, that\u2019s a very good example of centralization. And so I think that with Gmail, the value proposition is altogether different.

Kahn\u2019s narrative weaves a tale of innovation, community-driven development and the seamless blending of traditional and blockchain gaming technologies. Unlocking Undeads: AMA Exploring Gameplay https://t.co/4w6Oy8P65N \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 13, 2024 Kahn emphasized the complexity and dedication involved in producing a game of AAA caliber within the Web3 ecosystem, noting that achieving such quality involves collaborations with renowned studios like Warner Brothers for sound design. Reflecting on inspirations, Kahn paid homage to Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil series, a foundational pillar in the survival horror genre: \u201cSince I was a kid, I\u2019ve been playing that game, and they are still going strong. But it\u2019s really about how you take it to the next level. For example, in our game, you can play as zombies and you can play as humans as well.\u201d Undeads Metaverse is designed to be accessible to both Web2 and Web3 users. \u201cWhy even do Web2? Because some of the platforms do not support Web3 tech, whether it\u2019s your iOS or Android. So, we basically built it for everyone,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe spent about $9 million as of January 2024 in just developing this game,\u201d revealed Kahn and added: \u201cWe also did our mint launch, which generated a little over a million dollars in the dead of crypto winter, where nobody was doing anything. We became the top third tradeable asset on OpenSea.\u201d Kahn outlined the expansive game lineup of the Undeads Metaverse, including titles like Undeads Rush, Undeads Viral (both currently available) and Undeads Lottery (launching in Q1 2024), embodying the Web3 gaming ethos. Talking about the studio\u2019s flagship Undeads.com game, \u201cEveryone wants their hand on this one, they are like \u2018How can we play this game, get our hands on it?\u2019 Finally, after more than two years of development, this game is coming out in Q2 2024.\u201d said Kahn. \u201cUndeads.com will be VR-focused from day one, both for Web2 and Web3. We are not announcing any dates yet for when the VR capabilities are going to be available.\u201d Khan explained the difference between traditional Web2 models and Undeads Metaverse\u2019s play-to-earn model: \u201cYesterday, I was playing Roblox on my PS5. You spend time and you play these games, but the game doesn\u2019t love you back. You are just giving your time to the game, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d \u201cOn the flip side, for us [with the play-to-earn model], you get paid to play,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cYou can be a builder in the game. You can build amazing buildings, puzzles, weapons and potions. You can earn and sell those within Undeads.com. [...] With us, you can get the UDS token and swap it for anything you like. It\u2019s basically real money in the bank. That is the most interesting part of our game that separates us from traditional Web2 gaming.\u201d Community engagement is central to the development philosophy of Undeads Metaverse, with Kahn highlighting the active involvement of nearly 60,000 members across Discord and Telegram in shaping the game\u2019s direction. Kahn also announced the launch of the UDS token scheduled for Q2 2024, emphasizing utility over speculative trading. \u201cThere are about 1,500, maybe 1,600, Web3 games today. Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day, but honestly, they kinda suck and take the fun away from the game,\u201d critiqued Kahn and outlined their mission to deliver a AAA-rated game that genuinely entertains and engages its players. Kahn\u2019s vision extends beyond gaming to a belief in the enduring potential of the metaverse, citing significant investments by industry giants like Mark Zuckerberg as a testament to the metaverse\u2019s future impact. The Undeads Metaverse CEO\u2019s optimism is mirrored in the project\u2019s roadmap, which includes the integration of VR technology.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Games, #Metaverse, #Web3, #Gaming, #Play-to-earn"},{"date":"Apr 03, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ezra Reguerra","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/crypto-phishing-attacks-alarming-certik","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Crypto phishing attacks reached \u2018alarming levels\u2019 \u2014 CertiK co-founder","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"While the first quarter of 2024 seemed \u201crelatively typical\u201d when it comes to hacks and exploits, Ronghui Gu, co-founder of blockchain security firm CertiK, said the complexity of private key compromises and phishing attacks raises concerns. Gu told Cointelegraph that among the incidents in Q1, losses attributed to private key compromises increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2023. In its quarterly \u201cHack3d\u201d security report, CertiK highlighted that losses from this attack reached $239 million despite there being only 26 incidents. Compared with the same time period in 2023, when losses were only around $18.8 million, Q1 2024 recorded a 1,171% increase in losses caused by compromised private keys. Along with the 26 private key compromises, the overall number of incidents attributed to phishing attacks reached 83, with total losses reaching $64 million. Gu said that the complexity of such attacks also raises concerns: \u201cThe sophistication and success of phishing attacks have also reached alarming levels, with 18 phishing incidents, each causing over $1 million in losses.\u201d Despite these two attack vectors being a constant risk for the Web3 space, Gu believes the crypto community is not entirely helpless. He said implementing multisig wallets and multiparty computation can greatly enhance security: \u201cPrivate keys are the keystones of security in the blockchain world. Multisig wallets and multiparty computation can enhance security by distributing authorization power, thus mitigating the risk of single-point failures and unauthorized access.\u201d Gu explained that these techniques ensure no single entity holds complete control over the assets. This means that attackers must attack multiple parties to gain access to a project\u2019s private keys. Related: Nearly $100M recovered from hacks in March \u2014 PeckShield While the threats seem like a Web3 problem, Gu believes that countering targeted and advanced attacks requires incorporating both Web2 and Web3 security practices. This includes properly encrypting internal systems, implementing multifactor authentication and conducting regular security audits to address potential vulnerabilities. Gu also noted that educating employees is necessary to combat security attacks. \u201cEducating team members on the latest phishing and social engineering tactics can significantly reduce the risk of compromises.\u201d When asked if the trends observed in the first quarter would carry over to the rest of the year, Gu predicted that a continuation is reasonable because of the recent market upswing. He explained that as the market grows, the incentive for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities also increases. \u201cThis, combined with the escalating sophistication of attacks, suggests that we should not only expect the continuation of serious security incidents but also proactively prepare for the emergence of new, innovative attack vectors,\u201d he added.

Nigeria has introduced more charges against Binance despite the exchange trying to find dialogue with local regulators, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 3. Binance has been actively working with authorities in Nigeria since local regulators blamed the crypto exchange for helping crash its fiat currency, the naira, in February 2024. Bayo Onanuga, the presidential adviser on information and strategy, suggested banning platforms like Binance in the country. In response to the threat of the ban, two senior Binance executives, including Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, came to Nigeria to attempt to find a dialogue with local authorities. However, both were detained even after Binance urgently delisted all naira transactions and stopped peer-to-peer naira transactions in February. The WSJ\u2019s report on new charges comes amid Binance releasing a new statement urging Nigerian authorities to let Gambaryan go. The exchange argued that the executive has \u201cdecision-making power\u201d at the company and should not be held responsible while discussions are ongoing between Binance and Nigerian government officials. While Gambaryan remains arrested in Nigeria, Anjarwalla, another co-accused Binance exec, reportedly escaped the country using a fake passport in March.

The blockchain forensics firm emphasized that while the true intentions of AssangeDAO are unclear, investors should proceed with caution and conduct comprehensive due diligence before interacting with the organization. AssangeDAO, which launched in 2022, rose to prominence with its stand for the freedom of Julian Assange, an Australian activist famous for creating WikiLeaks, a platform committed to disclosing classified data from unidentified origins. Following a 2021 high court ruling in the United Kingdom on Assange\u2019s extradition, backers established AssangeDAO to advocate for his freedom. The initiative amassed over $53 million in cryptocurrency contributions, including a donation from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The AssangeDAO intends to use the funds to bid on a one-of-one nonfungible token (NFT) from a drop called \u201cCensored\u201d by digital artist Pak in collaboration with Assange. The sale proceeds are supposed to go toward Assange\u2019s defense fund and additional awareness campaigns as he fights extradition to the United States. The AssangeDAO\u2019s $53.7 million marked the largest amount raised by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) using the community funding hosting platform Juicebox, overtaking the widely popular ConstitutionDAO, which raised $49 million from the community in late 2021 to bid on a copy of the first edition print copy of the United States Constitution. Related: Lido staked SOL holders fret as $24M remains stuck on \u2018broken\u2019 contract However, collaborative analysis by SlowMist and RescuETH discovered that beginning in 2022, AssangeDAO moved most of its funds to multiple addresses, including several associated with cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken and Coinbase. Furthermore, the group transferred more than 1,000 Ether to various unidentified smart contracts, dispersing the funds among numerous addresses. AssangeDAO had not issued any public statements regarding the matter at the time of publication. SlowMist analysts stressed the importance of transparency in DAO operations, highlighting that the recent transfers have sparked questions, especially regarding where the funds ultimately ended up. On Nov. 8, 2023, AssangeDAO announced that 16 members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter urging Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop the dangerous and unprecedented charges against Assange. On March 26, Assange was granted permission by a U.K. court to appeal his extradition to the United States.

Since then, Bitcoin has continued to hold a price close to the $68,000\u2013$70,000 range, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. As a result of the market volatility-induced price fluctuations, only a handful of Bitcoin hodlers remain unprofitable. According to crypto financial services firm Blockchain.com, Bitcoin purchased between March 9\u201313 and March 25\u201329 is currently at a loss. In other words, 0.16% or six days of the last 3,732 tradable days did not turn out to be a profitable investment.

Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s consistent comebacks from bear markets and subsequent price retention allow the mining community to thrive, contribute to the hash rate and inadvertently increase the security of the Bitcoin network.

Notably, on April 3, SOL's price jumped approximately 5.75% to around $192. In doing so, the cryptocurrency fared better than the overall crypto market, which rose 2.2% in the same period. Solana's gains today coincide with the recoveries in the market valuation of its viral memecoins, namely Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK). Related: Meet the Solana memecoin that suffered two rug pulls but still survived WIF and BONK have bounced 5.4% and 1.3% in the last 24 hours, respectively. Among the highest memecoin gainers in the Solana ecosystem are the newly launched Cat in the Dogs World (MEW) and Book of Meme (MEME), which rose 45% and 9.5% in the same period. Solana\u2019s bulls have lately responded positively to the launch of memecoin projects on its blockchain, with recent Franklin Templeton research noting that these so-called joke cryptocurrencies \u201chave a strong relationship with their native networks.\" In theory, viral memecoin projects can potentially fuel speculative interest in their underlying blockchain network's native tokens. For instance, Solana's rival BNB Chain is even offering a $1 million reward to attract memecoin developers to its layer-one blockchain. As a result, the surge in Solana-based memecoins recently has been closely aligned with a boom in the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL); it has grown 70% so far in 2024 to reach 23.78 million SOL on April 3, indicating robust underlying demand for SOL. Solana's upside move today further benefits from its growing market strength versus the rest of the cryptocurrencies. Notably, the Solana Dominance Index (SOL.D), which measures SOL's market capitalization against the broader crypto market, rose 3.95% on April 3. The index has grown 28% year-to-date, indicating growing capital rotation into Solana. Institutional investors significantly contributed to Solana's rising market prominence by channeling almost $25 million into SOL-based investment funds in March, according to CoinShares' weekly report. In comparison, Ethereum (ETH), Solana's main rival, experienced a withdrawal of $67.2 million. From a technical perspective, Solana's gains today come after bouncing from the lower trendline of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern. Traditional analysts see ascending triangles as bullish continuation patterns if they form during an uptrend. As of April 3, SOL's bounce from the triangle\u2019s lower trendline signals a jump toward the upper trendline at around $205, up 8% from the current price levels, in the coming days. A potential break above the triangle\u2019s upper trendline can position the price for a push toward $250 in April, up over 35% from current levels. Otherwise, the price may consolidate further inside the triangle range, eyeing $175. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Seoul-based exchange\u2019s annual sales revenue fell 57.6% to 1.358 billion Korean won in 2023, down from 3.201 billion won in 2022, according to an April 2 report from Korean news outlet Newdaily. Net profit fell 74.5% to 243 billion won in 2023, from 954 billion won a year prior, but remained in a surplus for the fourth consecutive year. The main reason behind the financial losses was the decrease in the value of cryptocurrencies due to the crypto winter, according to Bithumb. Bithumb also offered a fee-free trading policy during the fourth quarter of last year, which contributed to the exchange\u2019s falling revenue. The exchange focused on increasing its availability throughout South Korea last year during difficult market conditions. This year, it will continue focusing on strengthening its services to drive performance improvements, a Bithumb spokesperson told Newdaily. The financial loss was reported on the same day Crypto.com announced it would launch a cryptocurrency trading app for South Korean retail investors on April 29, which could pose a threat to Bithumb\u2019s market share in the country.

Bithumb was planning to become the first digital asset company to go public on the South Korean stock market, according to local media reports that first emerged at the beginning of November 2023. The reports alleged that Bithumb was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2025 on the Kosdaq \u2014 South Korea\u2019s version of the Nasdaq. The IPO rumors were confirmed as Bithumb Korea started setting up a non-exchange business to accelerate its stock market debut, according to a March 24 report by the Korea Herald. Yet Bithumb has reconsidered its IPO ambitions after former chairman Lee Jeong-hoon\u2019s role in the company came under scrutiny, suggesting internal issues within the company, according to a March 29 report by Decenter. According to Bithumb officials, the IPO wasn\u2019t delayed due to legal issues related to chairman Lee\u2019s role in the company but due to a reassessment of internal strategy during an evolving institutional landscape. The surprising development comes over a month after South Korea\u2019s Financial Services Commission (FSC) proposed a new amendment that would mandate new crypto firm executives to obtain regulatory approval before assuming their roles. If the amendment is accepted, new executives won\u2019t be able to work until the FSC formally approves their applications.

The Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) team put forward the proposal, suggesting that DAI\u2019s loan-to-value ratio (LTV) be adjusted to 0% on all Aave deployments. Part of the proposal released on April 2 suggests that sDAI incentives be removed from the Merit program, effective from Merit Round 2 and beyond. This action aims to counteract MakerDAO\u2019s recent aggressive D3M plan, which rapidly expanded the DAI credit line from zero to an estimated 600 million DAI within a month, potentially reaching 1 billion DAI soon. The proposal seeks to reduce potential risks while minimally impacting users, given that just a fraction of DAI deposits serve as collateral on Aave, and users can readily switch to USD Coin (USDC) or Tether (USDT) as alternative collateral options. The proposal provides an example of risky minting practices on a smaller scale, such as with Angle\u2019s AgEUR (EURA), which was minted into EULER and was hacked within a week. Angle, an overcollateralized stablecoin protocol, and AgEUR, a decentralized euro stablecoin, exemplify the dangers of DAI\u2019s stablecoin depegging when utilized as loan collateral on AAVE.

Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual swaps or perpetuals, are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date.

If investors expect a lot of movement, the volatility rises, but if the expectation is that an asset\u2019s price movement will be muted, then volatility contracts. Kooner mentioned the new trading tools are introduced in response to cryptocurrencies hitting new all-time-high prices. He noted: \u201cWith many crypto prices reaching new ATHs, the likelihood of increased volatility and significant drawdowns means there is more utility for these indexes than ever.\u201d The news comes after cryptocurrency volatility broke all-time highs in March 2024.

Her comments were made in response to the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). In March 2022, the SEC issued SAB 121, which outlines the regulator\u2019s accounting guidelines for institutions looking to custody crypto assets. Notably, SAB 121 prevents many banks from custodying crypto assets on behalf of clients. Peirce noted that SAB 121 \u2014 issued without input from the banking sector \u2014 does not protect investors; instead, keeps out experienced banks and broker-dealers from the crypto custody business due to its capital implications. \u201cIt is driving broker-dealers to allocate significant capital to their crypto custody businesses or to avoid the business altogether. SAB 121 arguably does not protect investors.\u201d Additionally, if the custodian fails, these assets could be treated as if they belong to the failed entity, not the customers of that entity, she added. On March 1, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of a resolution that sought to overturn the bulletin. Republican Congressman Tom Emmer described SAB 121 as an \u201cillegal\u201d example of SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s \u201cunrelenting prejudice towards the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d Additionally, Peirce said the SEC had become closed off to productive engagement with the public, especially when it came to emerging technologies such as crypto. \u201cThe culture at the top of the SEC has changed, which in turn has changed the way the agency interacts with the public,\u201d she said. Related: SEC\u2019s Hester Peirce wants more decentralization in the financial system Peirce added that both investors and companies are hesitant to meet with the SEC out of fear of enforcement actions, especially in areas like crypto, which the regulator has identified as priorities for ramped-up enforcement. \u201cPeople have told me that they desperately want to have substantive discussions with the staff but worry that the inevitable result of such a meeting would be a call from enforcement.\u201d The commissioner called for the SEC to restore open communication with the public, provide clear guidance, and facilitate \u2014 rather than impede \u2014 responsible innovation, including in areas such as crypto custody. In an April 3 post to X, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal shared his support for Peirce\u2019s remarks, throwing his weight behind her suggestion to create an advisory committee to better understand how rules \u201cactually operate.\u201d Magazine: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #Law, #Business, #SEC, #United States, #Regulation"},{"date":"Apr 03, 2024","summary":"","author":"Brayden Lindrea","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-miner-bankruptcies-less-common-this-time-around-hut8-ceo","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin miner bankruptcies will be less common this cycle \u2014 Hut8 CEO","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"There will be far fewer Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms filing for bankruptcy in the coming years than there were in 2022, says Hut 8 CEO Asher Gennot. Speaking in an April 3 interview with Bloomberg, Genoot said that the main cause of bankruptcies in 2022 came from firms being overleveraged and unprepared for rising energy costs. \u201cA big area that led to a lot of bankruptcies in the mining sector and distressed assets was because of the leverage of 2021,\u201d said Genoot. \u201cA lot of companies grew with that and that debt couldn't be serviced in 2022 when Bitcoin prices went down and energy prices went up.\u201d Compute North, Celsius Mining, and Core Scientific \u2014 which has since relisted on the Nasdaq \u2014 were among several of the Bitcoin miners that filed for bankruptcy during the crypto winter in 2022. However, Genoot said that since then, Bitcoin miners have typically relied on less leverage and higher volumes of debt-free capital coming from equity markets to grow their businesses. He expects to see an uptick in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity among smaller-scale Bitcoin miners, something he predicts will contribute to a far lower rate of bankruptcies. Bitcoin would likely need to retrace to $30,000 or $40,000 for a significant amount of M&A activity or \u201cdistress opportunities\u201d to unfold, Genoot explained. The Bitcoin halving is currently slated for April 20 when block 840,000 is reached. The event will reduce miner rewards from 6.25 BTC ($412,000) to 3.125 BTC ($211,000) at current prices. Genoot added that investors will flock toward \u201clarge-scale operators who have the lowest marginal cost of production,\u201d in the wake of the halving. The Hut CEO said he took a similar course of action last December when he founded US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC) and combined it with Hut 8 Mining Corp\u2019s operations in an all-stock merger. The merger is now registered as Hut 8 Corp in Miami, Florida, which boasts over 9,100 Bitcoin, worth $600 million on its balance sheet.

Historically, Bitcoin has set new all-time highs approximately 6-12 months after the halving event, occurring three consecutive times in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin bucked this trend in recent weeks, surpassing its previous all-time high price of $68,990 on March 5, roughly 46 days out from the halving. Several industry pundits look to the recent launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States as the main contributor to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized and atypical price action in recent months.

Crypto veterans Drake Evans and Joe McGrady joined with van Eck in October to build Agora, which will launch the Agora digital dollar with the ticker AUSD, according to an April 2 Bloomberg report. Nick van Eck will serve as CEO. AUSD will be fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills and overnight repo agreements, while $90-billion asset management firm VanEck \u2014 where Jan van Eck is CEO \u2014 will manage a fund for Agora\u2019s reserves. \u201cThere is a need to have transparent and trustworthy institutions managing the assets of these digital dollars,\u201d said VanEck director of digital assets Kyle DaCruz. The $12-million seed funding round was led by digital asset VC firm Dragonfly, with additional investments coming from Robot Ventures, Wintermute, Breed and General Catalyst \u2014 where van Eck previously worked as a partner. Evans previously served as head of lending at decentralized finance firm Frax Finance, while McGrady was the director of operations at digital asset management firm Galaxy Digital.

One crypto analyst said it\u2019s common for memecoins to plummet when the price of BTC falters, however, another analyst linked the bearish trend to the humor simply running its course. \u201cI guess it stopped being funny,\u201d crypto analyst and founder of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph. \u201cPretty fitting that the top came in on April Fool\u2019s day,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is too much value on memecoins, it\u2019s gotta end at some point, it can\u2019t keep going forever.\u201d Solana's memecoin market cap stands at $8.29 billion, marking a 12% decrease within the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The leading Solana-based meme token by total value \u2014 dogwifhat (WIF) \u2014 saw a 9% market cap decline on the day, amounting to a loss of $3.9 billion. Notably, WIF still accounts for nearly half of the total memecoin market share on Solana. Across eight major crypto exchanges, WIF currently touts a total of $484 million in open interest (OI). However, $2.76 million in leveraged positions have been liquidated over the last 24 hours, including $1.89 million in short positions and $872,460 in long positions, per CoinGlass data.

Bitcoin dropped 4.94% over the past day to trade at $65,910. Meanwhile, WIF\u2019s price has dropped 10.3% to $3.67. Related: Base TVL doubles in a month as pundits tip memecoins to drive adoption Greenspan attributes this to the leading correlation that Bitcoin commands over other cryptocurrencies in the wider crypto market. \u201cIt has directional correlation, when Bitcoin is up, they go up more, and when Bitcoin is down, they go down more than Bitcoin. This will hold up for a very long time,\u201d Greenspan says. Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole shared a similar sentiment, telling Cointelegraph that it's typical for memecoins of this nature to experience up to double the impact of Bitcoin's downturns. \u201cAltcoins like this are high beta on Bitcoin, so if Bitcoin drops 7-10% as it has over the last day or two, expect coins like this to drop at least 1.5 -2x more,\u201d Edwards told Cointelegraph, adding that excitement has been driving much of the prices for Solana and Base in recent times: \u201cThere\u2019s just generally been a lot of hype for SOL and Base ecosystems, but I would argue that they have a lot less tangible value than BTC and Ethereum.\u201d Crypto analyst and Crypto Banter podcast host Ran Neuner said in an April 2 X post that the memecoin market is nearing an oversaturation point.

As much as $24 million in tokenized staked Solana (stSOL) has been unintentionally locked on the liquid-staking platform Lido due to a faulty smart contract. Lido on Solana \u2014 which once let users effectively stake any amount of Solana (SOL) for a 5% yield \u2014 was sunset in October 2023 due to unsustainable financials and low fees. Until February, users had been given the option to unstake their Solana through a user-friendly front end \u2014 but that too was sunset, leaving them with only the option of manually unstaking via Solana\u2019s command line interface (CLI). The CLI has proven to be too complicated for some users, according to messages on Lido\u2019s Discord channel in March. Solscan data shows there\u2019s as much as $24 million worth of stSOL still in circulation across 31,588 holders. Some on Discord have complained the process was too complicated for the \u201clayman,\u201d while others claim they\u2019ve run into unknown errors despite following instructions provided by Lido on So. \u201cCannot unstake stSol because none of the 2 solutions provided on the Lido site actually works,\u201d user ericxtang wrote in the Discord channel on March 15. \u201cI tried unstaking StSOL about a month ago, but it\u2019s still stuck with a validator and never went back to SOL, despite being [burned]\u201d another user, \u201cNumber9guy,\u201d wrote. It turns out the issue may not be the result of user error after all. In a March 30 Discord message, Pavel Pavlov, a product manager at P2P Validator \u2014 the team once behind Lido on Solana \u2014 revealed there was an issue with the smart contract behind the withdrawal function. \u201cIt is suspected to be associated with alterations in the Rent-Exempt Split logic,\u201d Pavlov said. \u201cThe current implementation uses the split function in the withdrawal process of the smart contract.\u201d Pavlov added while the issue has been identified, P2P also has \u201cno levers of influence in the situation\u201d and it\u2019s now reaching out to the Lido DAO to potentially change the smart contract. In an update published on the Lido Solana Discord page, Pavlov said that the p2p team had successfully fixed and launched an updated maintainer bot. He added that stSOL can now be withdrawn using CLI and referred users to an official guide for more information.

In an April 2 research report, Coinbase analysts David Han and David Duong noted several risks with restaking and the issuance of so-called liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). Ethereum restaking protocol Eigenlayer allows users to earn extra rewards \u2014 LRTs \u2014 by securing actively validated services (AVS) by staking derivative tokens, which are given to those who have already staked Ether (ETH) through liquid staking protocols such as Lido (LDO). When the Eigenlayer protocol is first launched, the analysts explained the restaking process should be \u201cfairly straightforward,\u201d but a feature of EigenLayer is that staked tokens committed to one AVS can again be staked to another AVS\u2019. \u201cWhile this can increase earnings, it can also compound risks,\u201d the analysts said, as it allocates the same funds to similar validators for increased yield. Secondly, the addition of LRTs means restakers could become concentrated into more high-risk providers offering the highest yields. \u201cAs such, LRTs may be incentivized to maximize their yields in order to gain market share, but these could come at the cost of a higher (albeit hidden) risk profile,\u201d they added. The analysts also warned that the LRT providers and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) would be incentivized to \u201cmaximally restake multiple times to remain competitive.\u201d Related: Vitalik Buterin shares the next steps for Ethereum Purge Despite the risks, the analysts said EigenLayer\u2019s restaking protocol looks \u201cpoised to become the bedrock for a wide range of new services and middleware on Ethereum, which, in turn, could generate a meaningful source of ETH rewards for validators in the future.\u201d Han and Duong also predicted that despite the amount of restaked ETH continuing to grow in the long term, there could be a reasonable short-term drop in Eigenlayer\u2019s TVL when point farming comes to an end or if early AVS rewards are below expectations. On March 6, Eigenlayer flipped lending giant Aave to become the second-largest DeFi protocol, commanding a total of $11.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) per DefiLlama \u2014 second only to Ethereum liquid staking protocol Lido. The market enthusiasm for restaking has already been met with controversy and Ethereum developers warn it could create a concerning amount of leverage.

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Catwifhat investor NFT_Sloth claimed that the project survived two rug pulls over 12 days, yet still has a dedicated community behind it today. First, the project\u2019s founder allegedly dumped their tokens into the open market only a few hours after launch on Dec. 12, 2023, cashing in 20% of WIF\u2019s supply for 3.86 SOL (SOL) (worth approximately $265 at the time) and pulling most of its liquidity. Despite this setback, the remaining investors quickly took over the project, forming a new dev team to promote the token. As a result, CIF recovered to a market cap of more than $4 million by Dec. 23, just 11 days after it had been rugged. But then, the token\u2019s largest liquidity provider rugged the project again on Dec. 24, removing 92% of its liquidity and tanking the price by approximately 76%. Despite suffering further losses, the token\u2019s dev team restructured yet again and continued to work on the project. As of April 3, its market cap sits at approximately $1.4 million. The 200 million tokens the founder sold on launch day would be worth over $250,000 today had they held. According to NFT_Sloth, Catwifhat was created to follow in the footsteps of Solana memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF), which launched in November 2023. This earlier token was created to take advantage of the \u201cDogwifhat\u201d meme that had grown popular on the X platform since 2019. According to meme history site Know Your Memes, the Dogwifhat meme got its start on Nov. 6, 2019, when professional Fortnite player Issa temporarily changed his profile picture on X to an image of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a beanie hat. Other Fortnite players also changed their profile pics to the image shortly afterward, claiming they were creating a Dogwifhat \u201cmovement\u201d or \u201cgang.\u201d Related: Solana memecoin craze causes Biden parody token to reach $250M market cap The following month, X users began to edit the photo in various ways and repost it to X, causing the meme to spread throughout the platform quickly. In November 2023, a team of crypto developers attempted to capitalize on this phenomenon by creating a token associated with it. According to NFT_Sloth, members of the Dogwifhat community sent images to various memecoin influencers on X. They took the influencer\u2019s profile picture and edited it, adding the beanie from the Dogwifhat meme. One of these influencers was \u201cJoji,\u201d who used an Azuki nonfungible token as their profile picture. They were sent an image of this Azuki with the beanie on its head, allowing them to express support for the token through this altered profile picture. Joji began promoting Dogwifhat on their Telegram and X channels, and the token quickly gained popularity. As told by NFT_Sloth, Catwifhat was one of the first memecoins attempting to follow in the footsteps of Dogwifhat. However, the developer of the project allegedly executed an exit scam mere hours after it launched. According to the Solscan block explorer, the developer of Catwifhat minted 1 billion tokens at the moment of creation on Dec. 12, 2023, all of which were sent to the deployer account. From there, they sent 10% of the supply (100 million CIF) to an account beginning with Fm1w and another 10% to an account beginning with AUKt. The remaining 80% (800 million CIF) was deposited into a liquidity pool on the Raydium decentralized exchange. These 800 million tokens were paired with 1 SOL, setting an initial price of 0.00000000125 SOL ($0.000000085675) per CIF. However, the token had no marketing on launch day. The developer deployed the token\u2019s contract and listed CIF on DEX Screener but made no further attempt to attract buyers. Despite this lack of marketing, the token attracted some buyers who saw it on DEXScreener due to its similar name to Dogwifhat, NFT_Sloth claimed. Blockchain data shows that at 9:41 am UTC on Dec. 12, the account beginning with Fm1w sold all 100 million of its tokens into the liquidity pool, receiving 1.24 SOL (approximately $85 at the time) in exchange. Two minutes later, the account beginning with AUKt also sold its coins, receiving 2.62 SOL ($180) in exchange. At 9:56 am, the deployer account removed its share of the liquidity pool. By the time it did this, all of the CIF in the pool had been sold, causing the deployer to receive only SOL from its withdrawal. In addition, because the previous two transactions had crashed the price, the deployer received only 0.00203928 SOL ($0.14) from its withdrawal. This alleged exit scam netted the developer approximately $265 worth of SOL in total.

However, NFT_Sloth says that several large investors decided to keep pursuing the project. They formed a team to take over its promotion. He claims that Joji also joined the team during this time and began promoting Catwifhat to his Telegram and X audiences. This led some \u201calpha callers,\u201d speculators who make public bets on memecoins, to increasingly make calls in favor of Catwifhat, ultimately bringing even more investors into its community. After the first developer exited, traders experienced high slippage from lack of liquidity. Yet during the first 10 days after launch, a single CIF investor managed to buy up over 55 million tokens and deposit them into the Raydium liquidity pool, providing enough supply for traders to keep trading. At the time, this investor\u2019s share of the liquidity pool represented approximately 92% of its total value locked. They also became a social media manager for the new team and had access to its official X account. This centralization in liquidity eventually led to the second \u201crug pull,\u201d NFT_Sloth claimed. According to NFT_Sloth, this social media manager revoked his own access to the team\u2019s X account on Dec. 24 and immediately afterward removed his liquidity. The result was a catastrophic slide in the token\u2019s price. The current development team alleges that this action was a \u201cliquidity rug pull,\u201d he claimed, as the person who acted was a member of the team and controlled an excessive amount of the pool\u2019s liquidity. NFT_Sloth claimed that the team\u2019s Telegram group and website admin also went silent after this event, providing further evidence of an exit scam. Blockchain data shows that at 7:57 pm UTC on Dec. 24, two transactions from an account beginning with CWSy were confirmed. The first removed nearly 102 million CIF and 1,630 SOL from the Raydium liquidity pool. The second removed approximately 55 million CIF and 869 SOL. Data from this time shows a massive slide in price for CIF. According to CoinGecko, the token peaked at $0.00431771 on Dec. 23, with the price being recorded as the day began at midnight. This implies that the token had a market cap of over $4.3 million at the beginning of that day. By the start of Dec. 24, the price had fallen to $0.00261692 and the market cap to $2.6 million, a decline of approximately 40%. At this point, the alleged rug pull had not yet occurred. The next price point recorded is at the start of the following day, four hours after the alleged rug pull had occurred. At that moment, CoinGecko data shows a CIF price of $0.00098130, implying a market cap of $981,300 and a decline of 76%. Related: Lena Network\u2019s Candy token falls 87% after $2.9M rug pull Despite this second \u201crug pull,\u201d the team reportedly regrouped again. NFT_Sloth said he built a new website for the project while another investor, whom he refers to as \u201cSam B,\u201d launched a new Telegram group. The old website was eventually taken offline for unknown reasons. NFT_Sloth also credited X user Cryptochristo with breathing new life into the CIF community. They reportedly spent \u201cten hours a day\u201d promoting the coin after joining the group, which helped to provide the public with new awareness of the project. He stated that some members of the community are working on an NFT marketplace that will use CIF as its native token, providing CIF with utility. However, NFT_Sloth also argued that memecoins shouldn\u2019t be judged entirely on their utility. \u201cIn all honesty, the utility side of meme tokens is kind of like the unsexy side,\u201d he stated. \u201cPeople are in it for the LOLs for the most part.\u201d He claimed that Catwifhat\u2019s ultimate goal is to \u201ctranscend out of the memecoin little bubble\u201d and gain \u201cmainstream\u201d adoption, similar to Dogecoin (DOGE). As of April 2, CIF has a price of $0.001451 and a market cap of $1,451,116. The 200 million tokens that the developer reportedly sold for $265 on launch day are now worth roughly $290,000, according to CoinGecko data. The story of Catwifhat offers some hope for victims of rug pulls, as investors were reportedly able to recover from the losses caused by these events. However, most victims of other projects have not been able to recover from these events. In May 2023, rug pulls drained over $45 million from victims, more than the amount drained from decentralized finance exploits. Since April 2023, more than $35 million has been stolen from over 42,000 victims in rug pulls, according to security platform Blockfence.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Altcoin, #Adoption, #Scams, #Solana, #Memecoin"},{"date":"Apr 02, 2024","summary":"","author":"Turner Wright","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/argentina-registration-law-crypto","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Argentine government passes registration requirements for crypto firms","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Argentina\u2019s government has begun implementing requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate legally in the country.

Certain companies offering crypto-related services must register with the Argentina government as part of reforms to the country\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws. The implementation of the law affecting crypto providers in Argentina moved forward on March 14, when the country\u2019s senate approved modifying laws aimed at preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. CNV President Roberto Silva said virtual asset service providers that are not registered \u201cwill not be able to operate in the country.\u201d The proposed modification to Argentina\u2019s laws affecting crypto users reportedly came before Javier Milei won the country\u2019s presidential election in November 2023.

According to the April 2 announcement, creators on OpenSea can now enforce earnings via one click. Invented last May by blockchain gaming company Limit Break, ERC-721C solves the problem of NFT wash trading by standardizing token transfer conditions, such as royalties, across all channels. Before their invention, users could easily bypass creator royalty commissions on secondary markets, such as OpenSea and Blur, by transferring NFTs through self-custody wallets or even other NFT marketplaces that did not honor creators' royalty requirements. \"In the long-run, this allowed for the incentivization of zero-fee, royalty-optional trading with airdrops, effectively turning tokens intended to be non-fungible into proxies for fungible tokens,\" Limit Break explained in a Medium post, adding that \"traders were incentivized to farm tokens by wash-trading NFTs among their own wallets, which is bad for the NFT industry.\" As told by OpenSea developers, compatibility for ERC-721C was only enabled by the March 13 Dencun upgrade on the Ethereum network. \"If you enforce your creator earnings according to the steps above, sales will only be supported on OpenSea and other marketplaces powered by LimitBreak\u2019s Payment Processor,\" the platform stated. After ERC-721C contract deployment on OpenSea, creators can still manually list their digital artwork on other marketplaces, but OpenSea will also match the lowest royalties available on other platforms set by the creator. The feature is also compatible with OpenSea's Seaport 1.6, which programs NFTs to be sold only under certain conditions, such as a changing metadata in reaction to sale volume. Although largely at the discretion of its creator, NFT royalties typically range between 2.5% to 10% per sale.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) rose 10.2% to record its best first-quarter performance since 2019, while Bitcoin (BTC) rallied nearly 69%. Will the rally continue into the second quarter, or is it time for profit booking? Investors remain upbeat on Bitcoin\u2019s prospects for the second quarter. Expectations of a pick up in institutional demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and Bitcoin\u2019s halving is helping maintain the bullish sentiment. Traders need to be careful after the strong Q1 performance because nothing goes up in a straight line. Bull markets are known for their sharp corrections, which shake out the late entrants. However, the dips offer a low-risk buying opportunity to the long-term investors. What are the important support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out. The S&P 500 Index bounced off the support of the ascending channel pattern and made a new all-time high on March 28, indicating that the uptrend remains intact. While the upsloping moving averages indicate that the bulls are in control, the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) cautions of a possible correction or consolidation in the short term. The first sign of weakness on the downside will be a break and close below the 20-day exponential moving average (5,176). If that happens, the stops of several traders may get hit, and the index could plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (5,055). Buyers will have to kick the price above the channel if they want to maintain control. That could start an up move toward 5,450. The U.S. dollar Index (DXY) has been gradually moving higher and has reached the crucial overhead resistance of 105. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory show that the bulls have the upper hand. If buyers overcome the obstacle at 105, the index could start an up move to 106 and eventually to 107. On the contrary, if the price turns down from 105, the index could slip to the 20-day EMA (104). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the possibility of a rise above 105 increases, but if the index breaks below the moving averages, it will open the doors for a possible fall to 102.50. The bulls are finding it difficult to push Bitcoin above $71,770, and today's correction proves that bears are not ready to let go. The tight-range trading is likely to break out soon, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty. If the price slumps below the 20-day EMA, the short-term traders may book profits, pulling the BTC/USDT pair to the 50-day SMA ($62,430). On the other hand, if the price turns up and breaks above the $71,770 to $73,777 zone, it will signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could then resume its march toward $80,000. Ether (ETH) has been struggling to rise and maintain above the immediate resistance at $3,679, indicating that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. The bears will try to take advantage of the situation and sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($3,386). If they do that, the selling is likely to pick up, and the ETH/USDT pair could skid to $3,250 and subsequently to the critical support at $3,056. If bears want to prevent the decline, they will have to propel the price above $3,679. That could open the doors for a possible retest of $4,000. This level may again act as a significant hurdle, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could reach $4,500. BNB (BNB) turned down from $620 on March 29 and fell to the 20-day EMA ($562) on April 1, suggesting profit booking by the short-term traders. The 20-day EMA is an essential support to watch out for because a break and close below it could sink the BNB/USDT pair to $496. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend this level. Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. The bulls will then make another attempt to push the price to $645. A break above this level could catapult the price to $692. Solana (SOL) once again turned down from the overhead resistance of $205 on April 1, indicating aggressive selling at the level. The SOL/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($180), an essential support to watch. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls continue to buy the dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above $205. If that happens, the pair may resume the uptrend and rally toward $267. Instead, if the price continues lower and plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA ($147). XRP\u2019s (XRP) price action of the past several days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the buyers or the sellers. The bulls will have to shove the price above the triangle to suggest the start of an up move to the formidable resistance at $0.74. Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below the triangle, it will indicate that the bears are trying to take charge. The selling could pick up below the uptrend line, and the XRP/USDT pair could dive to $0.52. Related: Here\u2019s what happened in crypto today The bulls are trying to flip Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) $0.19 level into support but are struggling to push the price above $0.23. The bears will try to exploit the situation and sink the DOGE/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA ($0.18). If they do that, the selling could pick up, and the pair may plunge to the next significant support at the 50-day SMA ($0.14). On the contrary, if the price turns up and breaks above $0.23, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to resume the uptrend. The pair could then attempt a rally to $0.30, where they may again face resistance from the bears. Cardano\u2019s (ADA) failure to rise above the $0.68 resistance in the past few days shows that the bears are active at higher levels. The bears pulled the price below the immediate support at $0.63 and will try to extend the decline to the solid support at $57. If the price rebounds off $0.57, it will suggest that the ADA/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $0.57 and $0.68 for a while. The pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern if the price plummets below the critical support at $0.57. That may signal the start of a deeper correction to $0.46. The bulls will have to kick the price above $0.68 to be back in the driver\u2019s seat. The bulls managed to keep Avalanche (AVAX) above the 20-day EMA ($53) in the past few days but failed to start a strong rebound. This suggests a lack of aggressive buying by the bulls. The selling picked up on April 1, and the bears pulled the AVAX/USDT pair to the $50 support. This is a crucial level to watch out for because a break below it could accelerate selling and pull the pair to $42. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the downtrend line. The pair could rise to $60 and thereafter attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $65. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Note that February marked the first full month of trading as the Bitcoin (BTC) investment products made their market debut on Jan. 11. Therefore, the strong performance in March reinforces a growing interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, continues to dominate the trading volume, followed by Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC. Balchunas acknowledged this in a subsequent post of X, sharing a chart by fellow analyst James Seyffart showing IBIT\u2019s growing dominance as it surpasses GBTC in market share. \u201cWhile all of the ETFs won in terms of being profitable hits, $IBIT won the volume race and is officially the $GLD of Bitcoin.\u201d On April 1, the cumulative spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows totaling $86 million, according to data from Farside Investors.

Fidelity\u2019s FBTC recorded the second highest inflows of $44 million on April 1, while ARK Invest 21Shares ETF ARKB saw its first outflows of $300,000 since trading began on Jan. 11. BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETFs reached about $18 billion and $10 billion, respectively, in assets under management last month and have been the most successful in terms of inflows.

Bitcoin\u2019s price correction can be mainly attributed to newcomers who ha entered the Bitcoin market in the past two months since the approval of the United States' spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Andrey Stoychev, the head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo. He told Cointelegraph: \u201cFor fresh adopters, Bitcoin\u2019s move from $40,000 then to the current $65,000 potentially signifies an over 50% return in as little as 60 days \u2013 a sure profit-taking signal in the investment world. It's important to remember that market corrections are part of every market dynamic.\u201d Stoychev expects a short-term correction thanks to new latecomers who want to invest in Bitcoin. He said: \u201cBitcoin bull markets have come with returns, as three out of the first four cycles have surpassed previous highs. Looking back at 2020, Bitcoin surged 250% in just four months after breaking a new all-time high, suggesting a potential trajectory toward $231,000 if history repeats itself in this cycle.\u201d Traders should be watching the $64,000 mark, with over $17.21 million worth of Bitcoin futures liquidation leverage on Binance, the world's largest exchange. An additional $9.92 million worth of BTC stands to be liquidated at the $63,500 mark, according to Coinglass data. Over $152.5 million worth of leveraged Bitcoin positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with $109.11 million worth of long positions, according to Coinglass data. Bitcoin\u2019s sudden drawdown caused over $165 million of leveraged crypto liquidations in less than two hours on April 2. Meanwhile, the dormant Bitcoin supply has reawakened. Long-term holder (LTH) supply declined by 900,000 BTC since the peak of 14.91 million BTC in December 2023, with Grayscale accounting for a third, or 286,000 BTC, according to an April 2 report by Glassnode. The report noted: \u201cConversely, the Short-Term Holder Supply has increased by +1.121M BTC, absorbing the LTH distribution pressure, as well as acquiring an additional 121k BTC from the secondary market via exchanges.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

ICOs swept onto the crypto scene in early 2017, allowing thousands of new blockchain-based projects to rapidly raise significant amounts of capital by selling pre-released tokens directly to investors. Projects issued their tokens in exchange for funding to launch new networks and decentralized applications (DApps). EXPLORE THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO An ICO is a token sale that blends the initial public offering (IPO) model commonly used in the world of traditional finance with crowdfunding, selling the tokens to raise funds for a blockchain-based project. It is important to note that while the ICO boom is looked back upon as a time when projects and investors made some seriously outsized returns, it was also rife with exit scams and rug pulls, something that would later draw the watchful eye of regulators and the relevant financial authorities. Despite the ICO boom being riddled with various types of regulatory and financial turmoil, it laid the groundwork for launching some of the larger projects in crypto today including Ethereum, EOS Network (EOS) Chainlink (LINK), Filecoin (FIL), Tezos (XTZ), and Telegram (TON). The largest ICO was executed by a private company called Block.one, the creator of the EOS network. EOS raised a staggering $4 billion in 2018. The second-largest ICO was conducted by Telegram, which raised $1.7 billion. However, unlike many of the other ICOs \u2014 which were offered directly to retail investors \u2014 Telegram\u2019s ICO was largely gated and thus limited to private investors with significant sums of capital. The decentralized storage network Filecoin is the third-largest ICO, raising over $257 million in 2017. Ethereum itself was initially funded through an ICO, raising a total of $18 million between July 22 and Sept. 2, 2014. Investors in the Ethereum ICO received Ether (ETH) in exchange for Bitcoin (BTC), with more than $2.2 million worth of Ether being sold within 24 hours of the ICO going live. The vast majority of ICOs in the 2017 through 2018 period took place on the Ethereum network, with smart contracts allowing developers to spin up new tokens and launch protocols more easily than any of the other available blockchain networks. The Ethereum network allowed developers to create new ERC-20 tokens and automatically distribute them to investors once the funding threshold had been met. Then, the projects were governed by DAOs moving forward. The functionality offered by Ethereum saw the price of the network\u2019s native token Ether rise rapidly in conjunction, skyrocketing from a price of around $10 in January 2017 to a peak of nearly $1,400 in January the following year. Similarly, the increased use of Ethereum during the ICO boom saw ERC-20 tokens become the industry standard and laid much of the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s continued prominence in the crypto ecosystem today. Despite many projects that raised funds from ICOs using their newfound capital for the right reasons, thousands of projects were either poorly planned or downright fraudulent, relying on hype and sketchy marketing tactics with no real roadmap or legitimate plans for development. It was the gradual rise of these projects revealing themselves to be illegitimate that drew the attention of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator first cottoned on to the issues associated with ICOs in 2017, following an investigation into a 2016 ICO from an organization called \u201cThe DAO,\u201d from which the watchdog concluded that the sale in question was illegal and constituted the offering of unregistered securities. This precedent saw the SEC take legal action against Block.one \u2014 the parent company of the EOS network \u2014 ordering them to pay $24 million in fines. Similarly, the agency also ordered Telegram to pay $18.5 million in fines and return a staggering $1.2 billion to its ICO investors. Telegram was forced to abandon the project due to the native TON token being deemed a security. As the project\u2019s codebase was open-source, the TON network was later salvaged by a community of developers. Despite being on the receiving end of regulatory scrutiny, ICOs played a pivotal role in fundraising for some of the most important blockchain projects in existence today. Notably, the ICO boom laid the groundwork for Ethereum\u2019s rise to dominance within the crypto ecosystem today, establishing ERC-20 tokens as the industry standard and significantly increasing the use of Ethereum by developers.

Plena leverages account abstraction technology to simplify blockchain interactions, aiming to boost global crypto adoption using smart contract-powered crypto wallets. Research indicates over 420 million crypto investors worldwide, yet nearly nine out of ten users still prefer centralized custodians or other centralized exchanges like Binance and KuCoin. The situation is primarily caused by the complexity of decentralized applications (DApps) and crypto wallets, the necessity of using native tokens in trades and the poor user experience. Account abstraction \u2014 a concept that simplifies how users interact with their accounts on the blockchain \u2014 stands as a promising model to address issues that hinder the global adoption of crypto. As proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, account abstraction offers an improvement in security and usability by reducing the reliance on a single point of failure, like smart contracts or private keys. Experts claim that account abstraction could attract a billion new users to Web3 by providing the convenience of using a traditional application. Contrary to popular belief, the blockchain ecosystem had already begun exploring similar innovations before Buterin\u2019s proposal was published. Plena, a crypto super app, was among the early birds in integrating the technology into its application, showcasing the practical benefits of account abstraction. Plena offers the convenience of a centralized exchange by combining full custody of assets and account abstraction. As a participant in the Cointelegraph Accelerator program, Plena removes the need to understand blockchain deeply or hold different tokens for transactions across various networks. Beyond trading, Plena includes tools like social networking, smart investing and market insights sharing to encourage community engagement.  Featuring a centralized app-like experience, Plena offers full custody over funds. Source: Plena The Plena crypto super app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and App Store, is designed with users in mind and gives traders an automated purchasing feature. With a streamlined registration process, users can create an account using familiar social media platforms such as Gmail, Twitter or Facebook, serving as a gateway to the crypto market. Plena maintains a commitment to privacy by not storing any user information. Plena allows users to perform complex blockchain activities, such as providing liquidity to a DEX with one click \u2014 which would typically require multiple steps. Furthermore, users can access a selection of thousands of cryptocurrencies and receive reasonable rates with minimal effort. Plena has released a new account abstraction software development kit (SDK) known as Plena Connect to improve user interactions in DApps. With Plena\u2019s SDK, DApp developers can enhance user experience without changing their existing codebase. The platform aims to create a seamless interaction process, simplify the user experience and advance blockchain adoption with its account abstraction SDK.  Users can trade, transfer or bridge crypto across multiple chains with a single tap. Source: Plena With this SDK, Plena expects to open the door to users who are not familiar with the complexity of blockchain operations and encourage innovation by providing a more accessible blockchain developer environment. Imagine buying an NFT on a marketplace like Axie Infinity traditionally. You\u2019d need to first acquire AXIE tokens and then ensure you have Ether (ETH) for gas fees. If the user earns their salary in PLENA tokens and prefers to use them for the purchase, Plena Connect simplifies the process. By connecting their Plena wallet to the marketplace, users can directly buy the NFT with PLENA tokens. With a single click, Plena automatically handles the conversion from PLENA to the necessary AXIE and ETH, including batching transactions to save on gas fees by up to 30%. The streamlined experience showcases the practical utility of Plena Connect in making blockchain transactions straightforward for users. Plena has processed over 5 million transactions and saw more than $30 million in funds deposited by users. The platform also integrated over 150 DApps through its account abstraction SDK. In addition to its 170,000 registered users, Plena has a community of 200,000 enthusiasts and professionals. In response to the growing community support, Sparsh Jhamb, CEO and co-founder of Plena, said: \u201cAt Plena, our mission is to simplify DApps and self-custodial wallets, making it effortless for anyone to securely manage their funds with full autonomy. We\u2019re simplifying the complex, making self-custody accessible to all.\u201d To further engage with its community and reward early supporters, Plena is collaborating with its launch partners, including DAO Maker, Chain GPT and Vixen, to conduct an airdrop on Galxe, distributing 2% of its total supply. As digital wallets and DApps become easier to use, the adoption of decentralized technologies will increase. Innovations like account abstraction lower barriers, making it easier for individuals without a technical background to participate in blockchain and benefit from it. The network effect will likely spur more innovation, investment and mainstream adoption of crypto.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Ethereum, #Adoption, #DApps, #AI, #Self Custody, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Apr 02, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/dwallet-avail-build-native-bitcoin-rollups","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"\u2018No bridges or wrapping\u2019 \u2014 dWallet and Avail are building native Bitcoin rollups","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) users will soon be able to access smart contract functionality without having to bridge, wrap or relinquish control of their BTC through a new integration between dWallet Network and Avail. The partnership will enable dWallet\u2019s smart contracts, built on Avail\u2019s data availability solution, to create Bitcoin signatures for the first time while maintaining a user\u2019s complete control of their BTC. Speaking to Cointelegraph, dWallet co-founder and CEO Omer Sadika said the Bitcoin rollup solution would interact with native BTC without bridging or wrapping, which by design has created considerable incentives to hack or collude to exploit: \u201cCross-chain solutions like bridges or federated MPC are broken because users must sacrifice their ownership to use them by giving away their BTC. Since the ownership is transferred, a collusion or hack could easily drain the assets. This issue already results in billions of dollars stolen.\u201d Related: Bitcoin needs to address scaling as ETFs drive momentum Sadika adds that the Bitcoin community has long been hyper-critical of Bitcoin rollups or \u201clayer-2s,\u201d with many solutions slammed for \u201caffinity scamming\u201d by duping users into bridging or wrapping BTC in exchange for other tokens. Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief technology officer of Bitcoin custody firm Casa, recently highlighted that nearly 30 Bitcoin layer-2 protocols are being tested. It is a fact that Sadika has aimed to address with the integration with Avail. He claims that dWallets enable programmable native BTC where a user signature is cryptographically required. \u201cAll existing Bitcoin rollups or L2s are using cross-chain solutions like bridges or federated MPC, violating the most sacred principle of Web3 and specifically of Bitcoiners \u2014 user ownership.\u201d Multi-party computation (MPC) is at the core of this functionality. MPC is a set of cryptographic protocols that let multiple parties compute a function together without revealing their inputs to each other. According to Sadika, a wallet operating on the decentralized MPC dWallet Network can generate a Bitcoin transaction. To do so, a smart contract on an Avail rollup is needed to approve the transaction as well as the user signing for the Bitcoin transaction. Related: Bitcoin block art? Marathon showcases visualization potential of block building He explains that the smart contract on an Avail rollup can enforce any logic, including custody, swapping, lending or staking. Sadika adds that the user\u2019s participation cryptographically guarantees that no one can collude or hack and steal the user\u2019s assets: \u201cThe fact that the dWallet generates a Bitcoin signature means the logic will be enforced on native BTC on Bitcoin and not using a representation of BTC, like wrapped tokens.\u201d The collaboration promises to use dWallet\u2019s MPC infrastructure to broaden Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities by enabling the creation of native rollups. Sadika says this will allow smart contracts to run any logic and utilize native BTC as part of the smart contract without bridging or wrapping tokens. \u201cSo any DeFi [decentralized finance] protocol like swapping or lending can now utilize native BTC. Other use cases such as staking native BTC, DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] controlling native BTC, trading a portfolio of ordinals, or gaming can now include native BTC,\u201d Sadika adds. Related: Bitcoin halving will be a litmus test for inefficient ops: Mining execs Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail, adds that allowing BTC to be used programmatically on other blockchains via a trust-minimized approach is a novel approach to driving Bitcoin adoption. \u201cBitcoin represents a superb base layer from the data availability perspective, with the highest security available in the ecosystem,\u201d Arjun said. DWallet technology allows a Solidity smart contract on an Avail rollup to create Bitcoin signatures and enables developers to manage a dWallet. Meanwhile, the dWallet Network mandates approval from the Avail rollup smart contract for logic enforcement, requiring users to finalize the signature to prevent collusion and asset theft.

The daily trading volume of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has dropped to $5.4 billion, 36% less than its peak of $9.5 billion recorded in the first week of March. Bitcoin (BTC) topped the digital asset flows with $863 million in inflows aided by ETF demand, with spot BTC ETFs recording $1.8 billion in inflows compared to $965 million in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Grayscale\u2019s ETF continues to see massive outflows nearly three months on from the approval of the products in the United States on Jan. 11. Continuous outflows from GBTC have put significant selling pressure on BTC prices over the past three weeks. Market pundits had predicted that, over time, outflows from GBTC would slow down and dry up, leading to unprecedented demand for ETFs. However, the current investor trends indicate that the GBTC outflows are far from over, with GBTC still dominating ETF flows. The selling pressure from ETFs is visible on the BTC price as the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency dropped by $4,000 over the past 24 hours, trading just above $66,000 at the time of writing.

Once easily done even on personal computers, Bitcoin mining \u2014 solving a cryptographic puzzle to produce BTC \u2014 has evolved into large-scale operations as the difficulty of producing Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a new historical high and continues to rise. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, in which block rewards will be halved, will pose even greater challenges for individual miners, given the increasing pressure from larger players. In addition to the necessity of immense computing power required to get real chances of mining the block, affordable electricity is a vital and difficult-to-find resource for maintaining mining activities in the green zone. However, innovations in the crypto ecosystem are reducing the logistical complexity of mining operations and the need for heavy investment, providing an affordable alternative for individuals seeking a way to mine BTC. GoMining, a global Bitcoin mining company, aims to break down barriers to entry for Bitcoin mining. With nine data centers worldwide, GoMining offers an innovative approach designed to democratize access to mining rewards. The platform offers an affordable nonfungible token (NFT) based alternative to traditional mining, which is dominated by structures with large financial resources and technical expertise. Utilizing its Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate concept, GoMining attributes the computing power used for BTC mining to NFTs, available for minting on Ethereum and BNB chains. Users who purchase NFTs, which secure their ownership of real computing power with values ranging from 1 to 5,000 terahashes per second (TH/s) for each NFT, can receive a share of the BTC mining rewards without having to set up or maintain physical equipment on their own. NFT holders can access scaling features and adjust computing power and energy efficiency with just a few clicks. Based on their NFTs\u2019 power, users receive mining rewards daily, which are deposited into their internal or external BTC wallets. GoMining platform\u2019s utility token, GOMINING, aims to create a dynamic and rewarding ecosystem. Users can benefit from the token in various platform payments, including NFT purchases and upgrades, and receive an additional 10% discount on electricity charges. For instance, the basic electricity price for GoMining NFT holders is as low as $0.05 per kWh, a cost that could be further reduced by utilizing the platform\u2019s token to cover energy expenses.  Token rewards are directly affected by the votes from governance. Source: GoMining Another mechanic powered by GoMining\u2019s token is its vote-escrow veTokenomics structure, which aims to create and maintain incentivized community governance. By locking GOMINING tokens to the veGOMINING contract, users can obtain governance rights and share the rewards allocated to management participants. Tokenholders can participate in the platform\u2019s voting procedures if they stake GOMINING tokens for any period from only one week to four years. The platform\u2019s algorithm permanently removes all GOMINING tokens used to cover electricity and maintenance expenses from circulation through a burning process, which benefits deflation and positively impacts the token\u2019s value. The algorithm also redistributes the minted tokens to service providers, community rewards, stakers and the GoMining team. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event highlights the importance of employing energy-efficient mining equipment to preserve the cost-effectiveness of the mining operation. GoMining enables users to enhance their digital miners\u2019 efficiency seamlessly in only a matter of clicks, which is incomparably easier and faster than scaling and upgrading a fleet of physical mining devices. By significantly reducing investment risk and removing the obstacles, GoMining aims to deliver stable real-world value to their clients. The platform, built for simplicity and ease, welcomes users of any level of crypto experience and focuses on building trust through reliable and predictable returns. With a current total hash rate exceeding 3 million TH/s, GoMining plans to bolster its infrastructure, aiming to reach a total hash rate of 25 million TH/s by 2025. As the difficulty of Bitcoin mining reaches new heights, a new approach emerges where large data centers and cheap electricity are not essential. This shift toward a more accessible and user-friendly environment lays the groundwork for a more inclusive mining future.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Mining, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #NFT"},{"date":"Apr 02, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/crypto-com-expansion-despite-regulatory-scrutiny-south-korea","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Crypto.com expands in South Korea despite increasing regulatory scrutiny","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Centralized cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com will launch its cryptocurrency trading app to South Korean retail investors on April 29.

AI developers see the removal of ChatGPT\u2019s sign-up mandate as a catalyst for developing newer large language models (LLM). However, many others raise concerns about the surrounding use cases. OpenAI estimates that ChatGPT has a weekly active user base of more than 100 million people across the globe. The number is set to increase, considering that a number of people who were previously reluctant to share personal information with a corporation like OpenAI can now use ChatGPT with relative anonymity. It is important to note that while ChatGPT-3.5 is not the most powerful \u201cfree\u201d generative AI tool on the market currently, BuzzFeed data scientist Max Woolf believes the move is OpenAI\u2019s attempt to keep people from using competitors. According to data from Hugging Face, ChatGPT-3.5 ranks 16th globally in terms of its capability.

Memecoin total capitalization surged to $70 billion on April 1, primarily driven by pumps in newly launched tokens, such as Solana-based Dogwifhat (WIF), Book of Meme (BOME) and older memecoins such as Pepe (PEPE) and Bonk (BONK). Coinbase layer-2 network Base has also become a hotbed of memecoin speculation. The recently launched Base-native token DEGEN is one example, which has skyrocketed an eye-watering 2,800% over the past month. The memecoin is an unofficial token that was distributed to the community on the decentralized social network Farcaster. Rynes added that market fundamentals are not playing much of a role at the moment: \u201cThere\u2019s some retail money that\u2019s entered, but nowhere near the levels we\u2019ve seen before; we\u2019re in an attention economy based on specific narratives, not real fundamentals.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano on April 1, who said that after around a decade in crypto, \u201cI can say with full confidence that this is, by far, the weirdest bull market crypto has ever had.\u201d He added that retail is not here \u201cin any meaningful way\u201d until the entire market goes up together: \u201cNot these isolated sector-specific pumps that are very obviously pushed by crypto natives and just involve a hot ball of money rotating around.\u201d Related: Memecoin presales hit \u2018peak degeneracy\u2019 with over $100M raised in 3 days Another factor adding to the weirdness of this market cycle is that Bitcoin has reached an all-time high before the halving.

Last week, a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen and Galaxy Digital were top contributors to VC firm 1kx\u2019s $75 million fund targeting crypto-based consumer apps and Hack VC in February raised $150 million to fund early-stage crypto and artificial intelligence startups. Infrastructure projects were the most well-funded firms in March, making up for nearly $283 million \u2014 around a quarter of the total $1.16 billion VC funding. Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects followed with $228.1 million in funding, making up nearly 20% of the total, with centralized finance (CeFi) projects \u2014 such as exchanges \u2014 seeing the third-most funding at $85.5 million. No funding was raised in the DAO category. Last month\u2019s funding is the first time since November that VC funding has broken over $1 billion for the month.

In an April 1 post to X, Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko announced the launch of a new Solana-based token called \u201cBunkerCoin\u201d which made light of the oftentimes over-complicated architecture of new cryptocurrencies. Yakovenko claimed the new BunkerCoin token operated on \u201cshortwave radio channels\u201d and leveraged several complicated technologies, including ZkProofs, Groth16 proofs and a \u201cNakamoto-style longest chain rule.\u201d Overall, the post was a jumble of crypto-related buzzwords designed to prod fun at new tokens. \u201cIf you are into mainstream adoption, pivot to bunkers,\u201d wrote Yakovenko \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to a similar post from All In podcast co-host Jason Calcanis on June 9 last year. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made a prank of his own, writing a humorous blog post that declared \u201cdegen communism\u201d \u2014 a light-hearted jab at memecoins \u2014 to be the only acceptable political philosophy for crypto. According to Buterin, degen communism is a political ideology that \u201copenly embraces chaos, but tweaks key rules and incentives to create a background pressure where the consequences of chaos are aligned with the common good.\u201d While the post overstates the importance of degeneracy and chaos, it comes back to an idea that Buterin mentioned in a March 29 blog post, where he talked about the need to make memecoins more of a positive force in financial markets. In a more light-hearted attempt at humor, Bankless co-host and well-known Ethereum maximalist David Hoffman made a tongue-in-cheek announcement that he would be leaving the Ethereum ecosystem and joining forces with Austin Federa and Yakovenko at the Solana Foundation. Hoffman jested that he would join the Solana Foundation as the \"VP of Decentralization\" \u2014 a subtle reference to a common criticism from Ethereum fans who often claim that Solana isn't as decentralized as ETH. Hoffman, a known Ethereum maximalist has long traded blows with Solana developers and enthusiasts alike \u2014 so a sudden switch comes across as deeply out of character for the Bankless co-host. Related: SBF speaks out after sentencing: \u2018I never thought what I was doing was illegal\u2019 One of the more questionable April Fools Day pranks, at least, according to Crypto X, came from an account associated with an Ethereum-based crowdfunding protocol called JuiceBox which claimed it had received financial backing from crypto venture capital firm Paradigm. In an April 1 post to X, pseudonymous account Briliegh.eth \u2014 since made private \u2014 wrote that JuiceBox has secured a $69 million fundraising deal with Paradigm, sending the protocol\u2019s native token JBX surging more than 45% to $0.0043, per CoinGecko data. It took an hour for Briliegh to reveal that the post was an April Fool\u2019s Day joke and the token retraced 25% to $0.0034. The post \u2014 which was screenshotted and shared across X by several commentators \u2014 was met with backlash from users who took issue with the humor. \u201cWaiting an hour to tell the world it's an April Fools joke \u2014 CRIME,\u201d said one user. \u201cJail,\u201d wrote another. A similar situation unfolded when \u201cSasha\u201d the pseudonymous founder of the decentralized tech stack Waves announced that the protocol would be integrating with AI and replacing its \u201cWaves\u201d ticker with \u201cAI.\u201d At the time of the announcement, the price of Waves (WAVES) jumped 5% before quickly retracing back to earlier levels. Several users failed to find the humor in the jest and declared it to be more akin to market manipulation. \u201cIs this [a] joke? Market manipulating,\u201d wrote one user in response to the post. BitMEX Research joked that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC's) outflows stood at $0. The post was poking fun at the previous high volumes of outflows from GBTC over the past few weeks. It clarified the joke in a follow-up X post, sharing the real GBTC outflow on April 1 of $303 million. The tomfoolery reached well beyond the more niche corners of crypto X, with Republican majority whip Tom Emmer using the day to take aim at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In four separate posts to X, Emmer appeared to make several statements praising the SEC and its chair Gary Gensler before finishing his post with \u201cApril Fools!\u201d Magazine: \u2018SEAL 911\u2019 team of white hats formed to fight crypto hacks in real time","tags":"#Twitter, #Cryptocurrencies, #Business, #Adoption, #Social Media"},{"date":"Apr 02, 2024","summary":"","author":"Brayden Lindrea","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-crypto-vc-invest-30-million-gaming-startups","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Andreessen Horowitz to invest $30M in tech-fueled gaming startups","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has announced it will be investing $30 million in technology-centric gaming startups, including AI, VR/AR and Web3 games. \u201cWe are investing at the intersection of TECH x GAMES, which means AI/infra, 3D tools, VR/AR, web3 games, gamified consumer apps, and much more,\u201d announced Andrew Chen, a general partner at a16z, who oversees a16z\u2019s Games One Fund.

That\u2019s why not everyone uses cryptocurrency \u2014 even when it offers more options and lower costs. The Swiss city of Lugano provides the best evidence of what\u2019s possible: More than 15% of its citizens use the city\u2019s LVGA stablecoin to pay their bills, make purchases at shops and restaurants, and access online services on a daily basis. Digital assets can offer improvements that are unmatched in the field of traditional finance, and they can be highly accessible. In developing countries, financial services still remain a privilege for a small group of people. Though just 6% of adults don\u2019t have a bank account in the United States, that number exceeds 52% in Africa. Cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t yet gained the same importance as traditional payment systems in terms of household payments. However, general acceptance is getting closer. Take, for example, crypto credit cards jointly issued by global payment companies and trading platforms. Stores and services including Wikipedia, Microsoft, and Google already welcome payments in Bitcoin (BTC). The latter exclusively partnered with Coinbase to handle crypto payments for its cloud services. Similarly, Time Magazine teamed up with Crypto.com to streamline digital-asset payments for subscriptions. You can even use crypto to pay taxes in cities such as Lugano. To make a payment, residents scan a QR code on the bill and then choose a digital wallet they want to use for payment. Last year, the city\u2019s PlanB initiative announced that residents and visitors of Lugano could live in the city using nothing but cryptocurrency. In addition to online payments, Lugano has more than 400 merchants accepting digital assets. This was made possible through collaboration between the city\u2019s administration and Bitfinex, which developed a platform to support payments with Bitcoin, via Lightning, Tether (USDT), via Polygon (MATIC); and the city\u2019s native LVGA token. The city expects to increase the number of locations accepting crypto to 2,000 stores in the years ahead. For taxpayers, some companies are also ready to provide ready-made solutions. For example, Coinbase offers a dedicated solution that can help users report capital gains or losses to the IRS. Thanks to a partnership with Cointracker, the company can provide a summary of a user\u2019s taxable activity to share with their accountant or input into tax software. Still, crypto's growth trajectory isn't without bumps and hurdles. Plastic payment cards caused surprise and confusion when they first appeared. Some innovations even faced public resistance. Such reactions are natural; people often fear the unfamiliar. Imagine seeing a zero balance instead of the usual $10 monthly fee \u2014 such a shift can turn one's world upside down. Additionally, user training and adjustment can prolong adoption. Still, the forecasts are promising. Juniper Research estimates that the global usage rate of digital wallets will reach 75% by 2025. A 2022 study showed that 36% of respondents were ready to receive their salary (all or part of it) in the form of cryptocurrencies. These figures continue to grow, and supply will be forced to adapt to growing demand \u2014 arguably within the next two years. The biggest step for crypto\u2019s integration with the financial industry was the January approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. It signaled that the \u201clegalization\u201d of crypto assets has already begun. This means ordinary users can start feeling confident about using crypto. They realize that digital assets are a natural and important part of the progress. More freedom of action leads to a completely different approach to the crypto technology implementation to pay for products or utilities. Moreover, participation by institutional players \u2014 such as MicroStrategy, Square, and Tesla \u2014 brings credibility and paves the way for wider adoption of blockchain-related services. The crypto industry expands its pool of their services every year: new products, payment methods, and technologies. It\u2019s unlikely that they will replace financial institutions overnight. However, this moment may come through intermediate stages \u2014 when seamless transactions or innovative payment solutions are needed. Crypto regulations will hopefully lead to a stronger symbiosis between crypto exchanges and banks. It\u2019s not hard to envision a scenario in the near future where users are able to arrange a loan from their banks in the form of their favorite altcoins. Banks may have to adapt and become similar to exchanges with certain specifics of activity. In this case, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms \u2014 such as Polygon, Archblock and Curve Finance \u2014 can bypass financial intermediaries and provide high-quality services with low fees. The history of financial instruments shows how unexpected the use of a new technology can be. The trends of regulatory change and adoption show the growing role that crypto plays in everyday payments, which is carrying the world toward more advanced ways of organizing finance.

When was the last time you went out without checking the weather first? It might seem like a mundane part of technology, but weather forecasting plays a crucial role in society by enhancing public safety, supporting economic stability and facilitating effective planning for individuals and organizations. From reducing disaster risk to enhancing agricultural planning and management, having reliable access to meteorological observation data is essential for civilization to thrive. Despite impacting more than one-third of the world economy, reliable weather forecasting data remains out of reach for a surprisingly large portion of the world. Experts argue that there\u2019s a significant disparity in forecast accuracy between high-income and low-income nations, with the former having substantially more accurate forecasts. The uneven distribution of the global weather infrastructure presents significant implications for managing the adverse effects of climate change in less affluent regions. WeatherXM, a community-powered weather network, uses blockchain to democratize access to reliable weather forecasting data. Established by a team of engineers and weather scientists, WeatherXM combines the Internet of Things (IoT) technology with Web3 to offer a new way to map the world\u2019s weather. Compared to slow and expensive national weather agencies, which also need to cover the cost of their investment, The WeatherXM Network operates as a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). It introduces a decentralized model where low-cost weather stations allow everyone to buy, install and maintain their own station. The decentralized aspect of the network, built and maintained by a community of weather station owners, enables the project to snowball as the community covers the costs and gets rewarded in WXM \u2014 the native token of The WeatherXM Network \u2014 for providing data to the network.  The weather data produced by the network is publicly available via web explorer and mobile apps for Android and iOS. Source: WeatherXM WeatherXM\u2019s decentralized model addresses the lack of hyper-local weather data globally. Accurate and immediate weather predictions and assessments at the local scale are hard to achieve by the current model of large, expensive weather stations often installed tens of miles apart by governmental weather agencies. With WeatherXM, hyper-local weather forecasting becomes available thanks to the distributed nature of its DePIN. WeatherXM has recently launched a campaign on the crypto donation platform Giveth to go beyond establishing a decentralized weather network and providing weather stations to the areas most needed. All donations collected from the campaign will be used to donate ten weather stations to EthicHub farmers.  WeatherXM is building a decentralized global network of weather stations. \u201cWe have deployed more than 4,700 stations in 81 countries in record time, but the areas that need them the most are the ones with slower adoption rates. We are about to change this,\u201d said Manos Nikiforakis, WeatherXM CEO. \u201cEvery station we install in an underserved area is a win both for the local economies and meteorologists around the world who can get new, valuable data for their models.\u201d Following the foundation of the WeatherXM Network Association in November 2023, the project is now preparing to launch the WXM token with long-term plans of becoming a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The Web3-powered weather data network presents a wide range of benefits, including enhanced public safety through more reliable weather predictions, support for economic stability by aiding industries heavily reliant on weather conditions and facilitating more effective planning for individuals and organizations.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Decentralization, #Adoption, #Data, #Web3"},{"date":"Apr 01, 2024","summary":"","author":"William Suberg","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/btc-price-slips-weekly-low-bitcoin-bids-62k","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"BTC price slips 4% to weekly low as Bitcoin bids line up toward $62K","type":"Blog","category":"Market Update","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) attempted to retest the$68,000 support on April 1 as the Wall Street open sparked weakness.

At first glance, the downturn in XRP's price is part of a retracement that began in March after peaking at $0.74 for that period. Since then, it has fallen roughly 18.5%, with its decline exacerbated by several other contributing factors. XRP's price decline mirrored similar sharp drops across the crypto market as risk investors reevaluate the trajectory of the Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions following a strong U.S. manufacturing data. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) manufacturing index increased by 2.5 points to 50.3 last month. This slight rise above the 50-point threshold, distinguishing between expansion and contraction, effectively ended a 16-month streak of declining manufacturing activity. The strong data suggests that the Fed might limit its rate cuts to just two this year rather than the previously anticipated three. Notably, the swaps market now forecasts a nearly 57% likelihood of a Fed rate cut in June and a 70% chance by September. Typically, lower interest rates benefit cryptocurrencies like XRP, which doesn\u2019t yield interest, as it becomes more attractive than interest-bearing assets. XRP's price decline today and in recent weeks coincide with a drop in the number of its richest addresses. For instance, the count of entities that hold more than 100,000 XRP has dropped 1.13% so far in 2024, indicating that either these \"whales\" are selling or redistributing them across other addresses. The sentiment is consistent among holders of 100-10,000 XRP tokens, suggesting a decline in the number of smaller investors, often referred to as \"fishes.\" Conversely, the number of addresses with a balance greater than 10 XRP is increasing. The actions of major XRP holders, especially if they decide to sell large portions of their holdings, could impact market perception and lead to a decline in trader interest. Throughout 2024, XRP has lagged behind its leading cryptocurrency competitors, recording a year-to-date performance of approximately -4.5%. While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant upswing, soaring by 55.5% during the same timeframe. That is further visible in the XRP Dominance Index (XRP.D), a metric that measures XRP's market capitalization against that of the crypto market. The index has dropped 36.55% so far in 2024, suggesting a persistent capital outflow from the XRP to other cryptocurrencies. Primary reasons behind XRP market outflows include the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) pending lawsuit against Ripple. A U.S. District Court ruled in July that Ripple's XRP sales worth $728.9 million to hedge funds and other institutional buyers amounted to unlawful securities sales. Related: XRP price-to-sales ratio double that of Nvidia Last week, Stuart Alderoty, the chief legal officer at Ripple, revealed that the SEC has requested a federal judge to impose a $2 billion penalty on the blockchain company. From a technical perspective, XRP's ongoing price decline is part of its fluctuations within a prevailing ascending triangle pattern. The cryptocurrency's next downside target appears around the triangle's lower trendline, coinciding with its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near $0.52 by mid-April, down about 15% from the current price levels. Conversely, a breakout above the triangle's upper trendline could take the XRP price to $0.74, its local peak from March 11. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Mi Primer Bitcoin, or \u201cMy First Bitcoin,\u201d began as a local education initiative in 2021 and coincided with El Salvador becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender. This new update of the program was developed in collaboration with Bitcoin educators and enthusiasts from around the world to provide a comprehensive curriculum covering various aspects of Bitcoin, from its history to its technical workings and everyday applications. Most notably, the update made the program open-source in nature, meaning all materials, including the Student Workbook, are freely available on GitHub. According to the announcement, this is in the hope of encouraging collaboration and translation efforts worldwide. John Dennehy, founder and executive director of Mi Primer Bitcoin, emphasized the transformative potential of Bitcoin education. He highlighted how financial literacy in the Bitcoin era fosters creativity, innovation, and long-term planning.

The previous diploma has been taught to more than 25,000 students in El Salvador since the inception of the project and has led to several graduation ceremonies. In September 2023, Mi Primer Bitcoin partnered with the Ministry of Education of El Salvador to include Bitcoin in the public school curriculum by 2024. Since its inception, Mi Primer Bitcoin has expanded its reach beyond El Salvador, collaborating with educational institutions and governments internationally. Last fall, Bitcoin Cuba also announced its upcoming collaboration with the program to bring Bitcoin education to local communities.

On March 5, Upbit recorded a daily trading volume of almost $15 billion, the exchange\u2019s highest trading volume this year. The crypto exchange\u2019s surge in daily trading volume may be attributed to Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $69,200 on the same day. The rush was primarily driven by large inflows in the new spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. While Bitcoin was trading below $70,000 in the rest of the world, the digital asset reached a new all-time high of 96,734,000 South Korean won (about $72,504) on Upbit at around 3:00 pm UTC on March 5. This may have played a role in boosting the daily trading volume at the exchange on March 5. This price difference in South Korea versus the rest of the world is commonly called the \u201cKimchi Premium.\u201d Named after the country\u2019s famous fermented side dish, the Kimchi Premium refers to the disparity between BTC prices on Korean crypto trading platforms and international crypto exchanges. Despite its uptick, the surge did not last, as the daily trading volume on the exchange dropped to as low as $2.6 billion on March 31. According to coin information tracker CoinGecko, Upbit\u2019s current 24-hour trading volume for April 1 is $3.8 billion.

On Nov. 28, Upbit owner Dunamu reported a profit of $23 million, which is much lower than the same period in 2022, when it earned about $123 million. The company said the lower profits could be due to a \u201csluggish investment market\u201d stemming from an economic downturn. It also pointed toward the lower prices of digital assets as one of the causes of the decline in profit. Despite Dunamu\u2019s profit drop in 2023, Upbit continued its business expansion efforts.

The gaming world met with decentralized finance (DeFi), and a new term \u2014 GameFi \u2014 was born. Web3 gaming has become an instant hit because it offers players an opportunity to earn real-world value through digital assets like crypto and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on top of the usual thrill of gameplay. Blockchain games have remained the top reason people use decentralized apps (DApps), accounting for over one-third of on-chain activity and attracting over 1.1 million daily users.  Gaming was the top on-chain activity throughout 2023. Source: DappRadar Initially celebrated for its play-to-earn (P2E) model, Web3 gaming promised a new era where gamers could earn substantial rewards for their time and skill. Yet, the model faced significant hurdles, notably the inflationary pressure on token prices fueled by an oversupply of offerings and the volatile nature of crypto markets. This led to a highly competitive environment, with crypto-driven promotions often resulting in the rapid inflation and subsequent bust of token values, challenging the sustainability and attractiveness of Web3 games. Fueled by the mentioned challenges alongside the changing expectations of players, the industry is undergoing a crucial pivot. Developers and platforms increasingly focus on gameplay depth and quality, transitioning from simplistic P2E models to more sophisticated and engaging formats. This shift addresses one of the core criticisms of early Web3 games on earning mechanisms that often took precedence over gameplay\u2019s fun and engagement. The emerging trend is a more balanced approach, seeking to integrate the financial incentives of GameFi with the rich, immersive experiences that gamers have come to expect from traditional gaming. One of the most notable strategies to emerge from this evolution is the \u201cChallenge and Earn\u201d model, which prioritizes skill, competition and gameplay mastery. This approach represents a significant shift toward rewarding players for their gaming prowess rather than mere participation. It aligns with the competitive spirit inherent in traditional gaming cultures and offers a sustainable model for integrating Web3 technologies with the gaming experience. Gamer Arena is a platform that embodies this new direction in Web3 gaming. Positioned at the forefront of the \u201cChallenge and Earn\u201d movement, Gamer Arena aims to redefine the nexus between blockchain technology and competitive gaming.

It has also been used as a way of introducing new ideas and technologies. Generally, the music industry has always been eager to adopt new technologies that help creativity, speed up the production process, and make it more accessible. Artists can now make full albums in their bedrooms using technology that didn\u2019t even exist 10 to 20 years ago. The same can be seen with new Web3 tools like blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence (AI) and their ever-growing use cases in music-related endeavors. In recent years, artists have used nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to release singles or create exclusive experiences for fans, AI to reinvent artists and sounds, and blockchain as a way to revolutionize music streaming. Audius, a decentralized music streaming and monetization platform, has been heavily involved in the converging Web3 and music space since 2018. The platform has made a name for itself capturing the attention of mainstream artists like Deadmau5 and Skrillex and their fans, being a gateway for many to the next iteration of digital integrations. Cointelegraph sat down with Audius co-founders Roneil Rumburg and Forrest Browning to better understand how the future of music can be decentralized, community-focused and AI-friendly all at the same time. While the crypto and Web3 space has been a \u201cniche\u201d industry for the majority of its existence until now, music, on the other hand, is nearly all-encompassing. Browning said this was the platform\u2019s initial approach: \u201cMusic is a hell of a gateway drug to crypto more broadly. The way Audius works and has worked from the beginning is that we\u2019re going after the mainstream Web2 audience, rather than a tool or a protocol for the niche Web3 community. This is being built with the intention of going mainstream.\u201d He said this included taking an engineering and product perspective that hid and \u201cabstracted away\u201d the more \u201cscary parts\u201d of Web3 that may deter the typical Web2 user who may not understand those aspects. This way, users can decide how much they want to interact with the important Web3 features that underlie the platform. \u201cIf you want to start to pull back the onion and get into kind of wallet addresses and sending around crypto or sending tips, you can do all that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your primary use case is to use it like a normal Web2 streaming service and listen to your favorite artists, perhaps buy a track because you\u2019re a super fan of somebody who uploaded a song, all those Web2 mainstream mechanisms are there. It\u2019s on us to make that usable for you as an end user.\u201d While many developers in the Web3 space wrestle with the idea of how to attract a wider user base beyond crypto natives, music organically allows for that inflow due to the familiar aspects of streaming, uploading tracks or even being a super fan of an artist looking to collect merchandise. \u201cUsers don't have to know that every time they favorite a track, repost something, upload a song \u2014 all of that\u2019s being documented on the blockchain. It\u2019s all moving around on properly decentralized rails, but both the artists and the fans don\u2019t have to know any of that if they don\u2019t want to.\u201d Related: How the music industry is battling AI deepfakes one state at a time with the ELVIS Act In March 2023, Audius introduced NFT-gating to its platform to allow its artists the ability to make certain songs, mixes and track stems (individual audio elements of a complete song) accessible only to fans who hold a specific NFT. However, this NFT feature was introduced to the platform at a time when the NFT market was in a major lull. According to data from CoinGecko, NFT trading volume in 2023 was down 50% from the previous year, sliding from $26.3 billion down to $11.8 billion. When asked if NFT utility in the music industry differs from general NFT market trends due to it being connected to music and artists, Rumburg commented: \u201cThe speculative side of NFTs is very much market dependent. The fandom side is not. I think kind of focusing on the latter with all the features that we build helped us weather the cycles in terms of usage.\u201d He added that the problem with chasing speculative financial use cases is that the usage of those tools now becomes cyclical and cyclically dependent. For Audius, on the other hand, the focus has been first and foremost on the artists or fans and not the purely speculator class. \u201cIt has trade-offs because it also means that when the market is very hot, we don\u2019t capture as much of that activity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the activity we do capture is durable and delivers value.\u201d Browning said that as time went on, the community on Audius began pushing for more than just an engagement platform, which grew into the marketplace they \u201calways envisioned Audius would become.\u201d In the face of rapidly emerging generative AI tools, the team behind Audius also considered its own decentralized community and how to best empower artists yet encourage innovation. Last May, the platform rolled out a feature that allowed artists to display an \u201cAI friendly\u201d label on their profile, which lets a fan base know they can train on the artist\u2019s work. Browning explained that anything created by an Audius artist using generative AI will end up tagging the original artist. \u201cThen there\u2019s a nice social graph, and it shows up that it is an AI generation of this other artist.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about making sure that if a lot of smart people are trying to figure out the legal aspect of this, from a moral and artist empowerment side, we just want to let everybody do what feels right to those involved.\u201d Magazine: Creating \u2018good\u2019 AGI that won\u2019t kill us all: Crypto\u2019s Artificial Superintelligence Alliance","tags":"#Blockchain, #Cryptocurrencies, #Music, #Adoption, #Artists, #Web3"},{"date":"Apr 01, 2024","summary":"","author":"Prashant Jha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/vitalik-buterin-next-steps-ethereum-purge","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Vitalik Buterin shares the next steps for Ethereum Purge","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the next steps for protocol simplification and node resource load decreases, known as the Purge. The Purge is a key stage in the Ethereum transition that involves the removal of old and excess network history and simplifying the network over time. Aside from reducing historical data storage, this stage also significantly lowers the hard disk requirements for node operators and the technical debt of the Ethereum protocol. Buterin noted that introducing Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP)-6780 during the Dencun hard fork eliminated most of the \u201cSELFDESTRUCT\u201d code functions, which simplified the protocol by removing complexity and adding new security guarantees. Buterin said that after the EIP-6780 implementation, each Ethereum block would have a higher number of storage slots due to the clearance of certain SELFDESTRUCT functions. Buterin hopes that a new EIP will completely eliminate the SELFDESTRUCT code in the future. Related: Vitalik Buterin is cooking up a new way to decentralize Ethereum staking The Purge will introduce history expiration via EIP-4444 to limit the amount of historical data stored. As a result, nodes will have the option to prune historical blocks that are over a year old. The historical data will only be required when a peer has to synchronize with the head of the chain or when specifically asked for it. Thus, when fresh blocks are confirmed, a fully synced node won\u2019t require historical data that is more than 365 days old. Buterin said that EIP-4444 can greatly increase Ethereum\u2019s node decentralization. \u201cPotentially, if each node stores small percentages of the history by default, we could even have roughly as many copies of each specific piece of history stored across the network as we do today.\u201d The Ethereum co-founder also shared that Geth has recently deleted thousands of lines of code by dropping support for pre-Merge (PoW) networks. He added that post-Dencun, an 18-day storage window for blobs will reduce the node data bandwidth to 50 gigabytes. Buterin also discussed the need to purge precompile Ethereum contracts. The precompile contracts are used to implement complex forms of cryptography that cannot be implemented by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). However, in recent times, the demand for the contract function has declined, and it has become a \u201ckey source of consensus bugs and a huge source of pain for new EVM implementations,\u201d said Buterin.

Bitkub aims to go public on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) in 2025, CEO Jirayut Srupsrisopa told Bloomberg on April 1. The upcoming public listing aims to raise new capital and boost Bitkub\u2019s profile. In addition to hiring advisers, Bitkub is now actively expanding staff despite cutting its headcount by 6% in 2022 and 2023. Jirayut said that the Thai exchange is looking to add 1,000 employees by 2025, doubling the workforce from the current 2,000 people. Bitkub initially announced plans to launch an IPO in Thailand in a 2023 shareholder letter without disclosing details. Based in Bangkok, Bitkub is the largest crypto exchange in Thailand, accounting for 77% of the market share as of December 2023, according to data from HashKey. The exchange handles roughly $30 million in daily trading volumes. Other major Thai crypto exchanges include Upbit \u2014 which launched in 2021 \u2014 along with Bitazza and Zipmex. However, Zipmex suspended trading activity in November 2023 following a crackdown from local regulators. Thailand has emerged as a major crypto player in recent years. It reportedly had more than 13 million crypto users as of 2023, accounting for roughly 18% of its total population, according to data from Statista. It is projected that this figure will reach 17.7 million users in 2028. Amid growing adoption, cryptocurrency firms have been moving to grab market share from Bitkub in Thailand. A major global rival, Binance, officially launched its local subsidiary in January 2024, and is planning to open to the public in 2024. Thailand\u2019s Kasikornbank \u2014 one of the largest in the country \u2014 acquired a majority stake in the Satang crypto exchange in October 2023.

At the time, the stake was worth 600 million baht, or $16.5 million. According to Jirayut, Bitkub expects Bitkub Online\u2019s valuation to rise as trading volumes on the platform near levels not seen since the last crypto bull market in 2021. Bitkub Online accounts for roughly 80% of Bitkub Capital\u2019s earnings. In 2022, SCB X, a financial firm that owns the nation\u2019s largest bank by market value, canceled a 17.85 billion baht plan to acquire a 51% stake in Bitkub Online amid increased regulatory scrutiny.

On March 31, Telegram introduced a reward system that would allow channel owners with substantial subscribers to earn 50% of the revenue from ads shown in their channels in Toncoin (TON), the project\u2019s native cryptocurrency. The catch? Public channels must have at least 1,000 subscribers to be eligible. The plan was first revealed in February 2024 by Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, when he announced the launch of Telegram Ad Platform to open up revenue streams for channel owners. Since the announcement, the price of TON has increased 111% \u2014 from $2.51 on Feb. 29 to $5.30 on April 1, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. According to the company, Telegram channels generate over one trillion views every month, and its owners will be able to withdraw their share of the ad revenue with no fees. It is also the third-biggest messenger app in terms of monthly downloads, after WhatsApp and Snapchat, according to Statista. To support the initiative, Telegram added Toncoin as one of the payment methods for purchasing ads on the platform. However, Telegram shows ads exclusively on Telegram channels, depending on the type of content the channel shares. Prior to the official revenue stream launching, Telegram channel owners monetized their following by selling paid posts, charging fees to join private channels and selling products, among others. Related: TON blockchain launches $115M community incentive program In an exclusive Cointelegraph interview on March 29, Justin Hyun, the director of investments at Ton Foundation, said that the blockchain-based mini-decentralized applications (DApps) on Telegram, also known as Mini Apps, could be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for mass blockchain adoption. \u201cThat\u2019s our thesis for bringing in more users onto the blockchain without even needing to educate them about the blockchain.

PeckShield said on April 1 that over 30 hacking incidents occurred in March, accounting for $187 million in funds lost. While the losses ran into the millions, 52.8% of the hacked funds were returned. PeckShield said that $98.8 million in stolen digital assets were recovered last month. PeckShield also highlighted the top five incidents within the month. The Munchables incident took the top spot in terms of losses in a hacking incident. It was followed by the Curio hack, the Prisma Finance incident, the NFPrompt hack and the WOOFi exploit. Most recovered funds were from the incident involving the nonfungible token game based on the Blast network called Munchables. On March 26, the project announced that it had been exploited, with initial estimated losses put at $62 million. However, the hacker later returned the funds without demanding a ransom. On March 27, Munchables determined that the hacker was one of its own developers. In the end, Blast creator Pacman announced that $97 million in crypto taken from the incident had been secured by Blast core contributors.

On March 28, the decentralized finance protocol froze its platform to investigate the hack. However, around six hours after the attack, the hacker said in an on-chain message that the incident was a \u201cwhite hat rescue.\u201d The protocol is currently in talks with the hacker, which may lead to a recovery. On March 24, Curio\u2019s MakerDAO-based smart contract on Ethereum was breached. While initial estimated losses were $16 million, PeckShield claims it is closer to $40 million. The security firm noted that the incident ranks second in terms of the amount lost last month. The Binance-incubated platform NFPrompt saw hackers illegally access about $10 million, and the WooFi decentralized exchange suffered losses of about $8.5 million.

BTC price action made history on March 31 as the first quarter of 2024 ended with the highest close ever seen. Old resistance is not giving up without a fight; however, a battle between buyers and sellers is keeping old all-time highs from 2021 firmly on the table. Thus, price discovery remains elusive, with Bitcoin needing a push to $74,000 to knock out the bulk of latecomer sell-side liquidity. The stage is set for potentially volatile moves as Q2 gets underway. Adding to the mixture is the classic macroeconomic data element, with nonfarm payrolls due from the United States at the end of the week. This will be preceded by fresh commentary from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve. Last week, Bitcoin appeared to respond positively to Powell, who kept the prospect of interest rate cuts in 2024 in focus. As Bitcoin itself stays higher for longer, seasoned hodlers are increasingly taking profit, going against the influx of institutional capital from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Cointelegraph takes a look at these issues and others in the weekly summary of what is apt to impact BTC price action in the coming days. Bitcoin \u2014 to all intents and purposes \u2014 delivered for bulls at the end of Q1. At just below $70,300, the March 31 weekly, monthly and quarterly close became its highest in history. A predictable retracement followed; however, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showing local lows of $68,900 coming hours later. On short timeframes, BTC/USD thus remains caught in a range that was already familiar from last month. $69,000 \u2014 its old all-time high from 2021 \u2014 continues to act as a market focus. For popular trader Skew, caution is warranted until clearer trend signals arrive. \u201cGoing to be more observant here before jumping into positions,\u201d he wrote in one of his latest posts on X. \u201cSo far 4H trend is still intact, will be looking for the market to maintain this with sufficient spot buying & perp bid for momentum.\u201d Skew also flagged the first Wall Street open as significant, marking the return of ETF flows. \u201cBiggest HTF level for now is $69K,\u201d he confirmed about higher timeframes alongside an illustrative chart. \u201cMonthly/Weekly open will be important later.\u201d Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital was more upbeat about the candle closes. Bitcoin, he argued, could easily challenge the top of its range in order to confirm it as longer-term support before using this as a basis for fresh upside. \u201cBitcoin has kickstarted the breakout process,\u201d he told X followers on April 1. \u201cWeekly Close above the Range High is the 1st step. And if $BTC needs to dip into the RH to successfully retest it as new support before continuing higher... That would be the 2nd step to fully confirming the breakout.\u201d For Micha√´l van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading, the low-timeframe trend revolves around two clear lines in the sand: $67,000 and $71,700. \u201cIf either of the two happens, probably direction is chosen,\u201d he predicted. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have one final ATH test before halving happens.\u201d A fresh appearance from Fed Chair Powell forms one highlight of the upcoming U.S. macro week. Powell will deliver prepared remarks on April 3, joining several other senior Fed officials throughout the week. Risk assets continue to stay optimistic around long-term economic policy, with some form of interest rate cuts all but guaranteed as 2024 progresses. Last week, Powell said that even recent \u201chot\u201d inflation reports should not form the basis for an overly hawkish stance on the economy and that the Fed would take a more balanced approach in timing cuts. This week\u2019s data, meanwhile, centers on nonfarm payrolls \u2014 a release that recently contributed to BTC price volatility \u2014 due on April 5. \u201cUS employment data due on Friday. And just like prior US data points / FOMC... an opportunity to pick up some cheap tokens could be ahead,\u201d financial commentator Tedtalksmacro commented in part of an X post on the week ahead. \u201cCurrently, the market is on par with the Fed at 3 cuts priced for the end of the year. As with inflation data, employment data will move markets on any significant miss.\u201d Tedtalksmacro explained that \u201cweak\u201d job numbers would boost the odds of an earlier rate cut and thus fuel risk-asset strength. \u201cIt\u2019s all about jobs data and Fed speakers are we officially kick off the second quarter,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter agreed in its own weekly outlook. As Bitcoin sets new records on the charts, long-term holders are wasting little time in taking profit. What was first a trickle is now gaining pace, on-chain data shows \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdiamond hands\u201d are no longer on the sidelines. In the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode revealed a fresh peak in realized profits. These refer to coins moving on-chain from two investor cohorts: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). STHs are entities hodling coins for less than 155 days, and reflect the more speculative end of the Bitcoin investor spectrum. LTHs, by contrast, are those willing to hodl BTC with more conviction. Last month, as BTC/USD hit all-time highs of $73,700, a spike in profit-taking occurred, which peaked at around $2.6 billion per day. Glassnode showed that 40% of this came from LTHs. The situation has since changed, with overall profit-taking significantly declined, but LTHs still represent a significant chunk of realized profits. On March 31, these totaled just over $1 billion, with LTHs accounting for nearly half of the tally. \u201cFrom this, analysts can start to consider LTHs as an increasingly important cohort when assessing the magnitude of sell-side supply pressure moving forwards,\u201d Glassnode wrote in its newsletter. Glassnode also unveiled what it calls a \u201cremarkable similarity\u201d between the current BTC price action and its previous bull market in 2021. Overlaying this year\u2019s performance against that of previous cycles shows the 2011\u20132013 cycle as a clear outlier. This, in turn, challenges the concept that institutional interest has delivered a new BTC price paradigm this year. \u201cIf we index price performance (black) since the April 2021 ATH (where we argue bear market sentiment set in), we can see a remarkable similarity to the prior cycle (blue), \u201cThe Week On-Chain\u201d explained about a cycle comparison chart. \u201cBy both duration and distance from the April 2021 peak, the market is in a near identical spot to December 2020 relative to the 2018-21 cycle.\u201d December 2020 marked a launchpad moment for Bitcoin, which took off from its prior all-time highs to enter price discovery after first retesting them for around two weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, this year nonetheless marks the first instance of an all-time high coming immediately before a block subsidy halving. Crypto market sentiment is increasingly anticipating a shot at price discovery across markets, data shows.

This has come independent of a marked price uptick, suggesting that should the bull market deliver snap upside, traders could become increasingly irrational. Fear and Greed has remained steadily above levels seen during the 2021 all-time highs, but still with room to increase before entering levels synonymous with cross-market price corrections. Analyzing the impetus for investor optimism last week, research firm Santiment argued that it could form part of wider belief in risk assets. \u201cCrypto traders normally hope that Bitcoin and other assets carve their own market performance path, without reliance on equities or other sectors,\u201d it wrote on X. \u201cBut for a change, the crowd has been suggesting that the strong #AllTimeHigh levels from the #SP500 and gold are creating a bullish divergence for $BTC and altcoins to be pulled up from profit distributions from these other sectors.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Speaking to Cointelegraph on the sidelines of the Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne, Miller looked to the influx of fresh capital into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stablecoin adoption and BlackRock\u2019s recent move to launch a $100 million tokenization fund on Ethereum as reasons to take a bullish outlook on crypto in the coming months. \u201cWe are now at a positive inflection point when it comes to demand. It feels like we\u2019re well and truly back in a positive place for crypto,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIt\u2019s all just proof that this is the financial services infrastructure of the future.\u201d Miller noted that while institutional demand for crypto had soared in the United States \u2014 with fund managers such as Fidelity and BlackRock instructing their clients to invest in Bitcoin \u2014 this was yet to make its way to Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not seeing that level of action in Australia, but it\u2019s certainly a stepping stone toward that,\u201d he said. However, Miller explained there had still been a drastic uptick in interest from retail investors and crypto-related businesses in the country. \u201cWe\u2018re still seeing quite an increase in adoption here. People are starting to invest again, and many are building new businesses around crypto as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of these businesses come to us specifically because they\u2019re after liquidity,\u201d added Miller. Miller noted that many of the new Australian crypto businesses were focused largely on stablecoins, which he \u2014 like many others \u2014 described as the crypto industry\u2019s \u201ckiller app.\u201d Related: Avalanche and Chainlink collaborate on Australasian on-chain asset settlement To Miller, the biggest roadblock to domestic crypto adoption stems from the lack of regulatory clarity and relatively slow progress in legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to take risk and invest in the crypto space in Australia because there\u2019s just that lack of certainty.\u201d However, Miller said his firm\u2019s engagement with Australian policymakers had been largely positive so far, and now the main target was ensuring that sensible laws were put in place by the government. \u201cAll of our engagement with [Australian] Treasury has been positive. Our next challenge is to kind of get the government to prioritize legislation. It\u2019s very hard to do that, but I think we\u2019re getting closer,\u201d he said. In October 2023, the Department of the Treasury released a consultation paper that proposed mandating crypto exchanges to apply for a financial services license from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). On March 21, ASIC head Alan Kirkland said the regulator would focus on solving the \u201cregulatory trilemma\u201d \u2014 consumer protection, market integrity and encouraging financial innovation \u2014 when releasing the next round of regulatory reforms for the sector in the coming months.

On April 1, the Polygon CEO said that Polygon Labs, a layer-2 scaling network for Ethereum, does not work on layer 3s because they are not needed to scale existing networks. \u201cL3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,\u201d he said. However, Boiron\u2019s comments didn\u2019t go unchallenged. One respondent commented that layer-2s on Ethereum \u201cARE value on Ethereum,\u201d to which Boiron replied in partial agreement, adding: \u201cI disagree that L2 value is Ethereum value. Just take this to the extreme. If all L3s settled to one L2, then Ethereum would capture basically no value and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk.\u201d \u201cAlso, we don\u2019t care what people do. They can build L3s on anything, including Polygon networks,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cWe just aren\u2019t trying to suck all value onto Polygon networks instead of sharing with Ethereum its fair share.\u201d Boiron added that Polygon\u2019s mission was to scale Ethereum when nobody else did it, when the right tech was ready, using parallelization of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and with privacy. He argued that \u201cL3s are not consistent with that mission.\u201d Layer-3 protocols are built on top of L2s to host application-specific decentralized applications, providing a range of solutions for scaling, performance, interoperability, customization and costs. Current leading players in the L3 ecosystem and solutions from L2 networks include Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains and the recently launched Degen Chain on Arbitrum Orbit. However, the sector is still small by comparison, with only four L3 tokens listed by CoinGecko. Related: You can now deploy your own L3 rollup for $50 a month Meanwhile, the senior partnership manager at Offchain Labs, Peter Haymond, argued that there were many benefits to L3s that don\u2019t take value from Ethereum. The low cost of native bridging from L2 rather than L1, the low cost of proving on-chain, custom gas tokens, and specialized state transition functions were among some of them. Arbitrum Foundation researcher Patrick McCorry said he was surprised by Boiron\u2019s take, adding: \u201cL3s seem like a no-brainer, especially when it allows the L2 to eventually become a settlement layer (ie executing the bridge is cheaper) and ultimately relying on Ethereum as global ordering service + final judge of settlement.\u201d On March 31, Helus Labs CEO Mert Mumtaz appeared to agree with Marc Boiron in a separate post on X, stating that \u201cL3s are basically centralized servers settling on other centralized servers (L2s) \u2014 controlled by multisigs.\u201d Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin ignited the L3 debate in late 2022 when he said that layer-3s will serve a different purpose to scaling by providing \u201ccustomized functionality.\u201d A third layer on the blockchain makes sense only if it provides a different function to layer-2s, he said at the time.

In its suit, the SEC also claimed Sun, a Chinese-born Grenadian citizen, engaged in \u201cmanipulative wash trading\u201d \u2014 where one entity buys and sells a token to simulate market activity \u2014 and secretly paid celebrities, including Soulja Boy and Akon, to promote the tokens. \u201cNo particularized facts show that the trades were actually \u2018wash trades,\u2019 wrongfully executed for illegitimate purposes (much less affecting anyone in the United States),\u201d Tron wrote in its motion. \u201cThe SEC also does not allege a single victim,\u201d it added.

In a March 30 interview with Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, Hayes argued that memecoins bring value to the crypto sector by drumming up attention and then accruing new users and engineers to blockchains. \u201cYou can poo-poo these things as stupid and valueless, but if it brings attention and more engineers to the space, it\u2019s positive value for the chain itself.\u201d \u201cThe chains that can support this culture are going to be the chains that have value,\u201d Hayes said, adding that Solana and Ethereum stand as the most well-positioned networks to capture the flow of attention from memes. Last year, Solana network activity grew considerably after a memecoin frenzy in November \u2014 with many non-meme projects launching on the network in the following months. Similarly, network and development activity on Bitcoin has grown significantly after a flood of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals around the same time. Pal believes memecoins would likely grow increasingly popular among younger crypto investors, capitalizing on the \u201cgaming mentality\u201d present in Gen Z and Millennials. \u201cThis is the same thing, just gaming with money,\u201d said Pal. Both Pal and Hayes noted that the attention flowing into memecoins would continue for some time into the future, with Solana-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) slated to be projected on the Las Vegas Sphere sometime in the coming months. The dog-themed memecoin recently flipped the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum (ARB) in terms of total market capitalization. At the time of publication, WIF commands a market cap of $4.5 billion, while ARB stands at $4.4 billion. Industry executives, however, argue there are also countless risks that come along with memecoins. In a March 14 investor note, United States investment firm Franklin Templeton wrote that while memecoins may present an opportunity for \u201cquick profits,\u201d \u2014 they are prone to risks that arise from lacking any fundamental \u201cvalue or utility.\u201d In a March 29 blog post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his general disinterest in memecoins. However, he asked crypto investors and memecoin developers to find a way to make the tokens useful or charitable \u2014 instead of merely denouncing them or \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d to those who trade them. \u201cI value people\u2019s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it,\u201d Buterin wrote.

In a \u201cpath forward\u201d post on April 1, core contributor \u201cFrank\u201d said the firm would continue to seek the return of funds, but the top priority is to unpause the protocod and said it needed all users to ensure their wallets and positions were safe first. The protocol suffered a multimillion-dollar exploit on March 28, which was later revealed to be the result of two MigrateTroveZap contracts, which were designed to migrate user positions from one trove manager to another, according to a post-mortem post from Prisma last updated on March 31. However, Frank noted that there were still 14 remaining accounts that had yet to revoke the affected smart contract, five of which were still \u201cat risk\u201d with open trove positions totaling over $500,000. \u201cOf the affected Troves several have revoked the contract containing the vulnerability with ~$540k of collateral still at risk at the time of writing.\u201d Prisma is a decentralized borrowing protocol that uses \u201ctroves\u201d \u2014 Ethereum addresses \u2014 where users can take out and maintain loans. The largest \u201cat risk\u201d address contains $484,380, while the other four carry between $7,120 and $22,080. Frank explained that part of its \u201cpath forward\u201d was to \u201cconserve additional reserves\u201d while Prisma attempted to recover the stolen funds. A new proposal was made on April 1 to reduce liquidity from POL and staked revenue from vePRISMA. Prisma also stressed that the exploited contract was isolated from the core protocol and that it plans to restart it once the remaining user funds are safe. Meanwhile, the self-claimed \u201cwhite hat\u201d has accused the DeFi firm of failing to act in good faith and claims the funds won\u2019t be returned unless it makes a public apology. Part of that apology involves Prisma holding an online conference, in which the entire team must show their faces with ID and apologize to all users and investors for failing to properly audit its smart contract. In a March 30 on-chain message, the exploiter wrote: \u201cDuring that session, you must specifically present the mistake you made, which party audited the smart contract, and your plan to improve security in the future.\u201d The exploiter also wants Prisma to acknowledge they have \u201cno responsibilities\u201d in the ordeal and are only trying to help Prisma rectify its mistake.

The term \u201cBitcoin whale\u201d is colloquially used to denote a holder with a significant stake compared to smaller participants, often referred to as \u201csmaller fish\u201d within the market. The owner of the wallet or cluster of wallets controlled by one entity may be an individual or a group that is pooling funds to make large investments. Their vast holdings have been accumulated through mining, early investments and other methods. Whales have access to substantial Bitcoin holdings, which gives them the power to manipulate the market by making significant asset purchases or sales that result in price fluctuations. The abundance of whales and extreme volatility are frequently linked in the cryptocurrency space. A person or organization is deemed a \u201cBitcoin whale\u201d if they possess a significant quantity of Bitcoin; however, the threshold for this classification is not set. The widely acknowledged benchmark for being considered a Bitcoin whale stands at 1,000 BTC. This threshold is commonly cited by cryptocurrency analytics firms such as Glassnode, when identifying network entities (clusters of addresses) with a minimum of 1,000 Bitcoin. As of March 2024, the distribution of Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated. Only three Bitcoin addresses hold between 100,000 and 1 million BTC, totaling 577,502 BTC. The next 108 largest owners possess a combined total of 2,437,765 BTC, with individual holdings ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 BTC. Together, these 111 wealthiest addresses account for approximately 15.34% of the total Bitcoin supply. Whales wield significant influence over its market dynamics. Their massive holdings give them the power to sway Bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand, triggering price fluctuations with their trades. When whales increase their Bitcoin stash, prices tend to soar, while selling off portions of their holdings can lead to declines. By holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies, crypto whales can generate scarcity, driving up demand and value. Large transactions by whales can trigger significant price shifts, guiding other traders\u2019 actions. These whales often operate in the public eye, with their wallets tracked by the wider trading community. As a result, their trading decisions or anticipated moves can spark major price shifts as traders follow suit. Some Bitcoin whales opt for over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading to minimize their impact on prices, while others leverage exchanges to manipulate markets by signaling large buys or sells. Crypto whales stand out from ordinary investors because they take a long-term view of the cryptocurrency market and often use advanced investment tactics. Large Bitcoin players occasionally engage in pump-and-dump schemes, which involve buying large quantities of Bitcoin at one time to drive up its price and then selling it at a profit, leaving other investors with a loss. Additionally, they may start rumors on social media to boost interest and push up the price to attract smaller investors to join in. Bitcoin whales eventually sell, which causes a price decline and losses for small investors. Whales can gradually accumulate Bitcoin by making calculated purchases at low prices or during market downturns. Over time, they increase their holdings of Bitcoin by taking advantage of opportunities to buy large volumes of Bitcoin at advantageous prices. By holding Bitcoin for an extended period of time, the whales can protect themselves from inflation or profit from the possible long-term increase in the value of Bitcoin. Beyond Bitcoin, some whales diversify their cryptocurrency holdings by investing in other digital assets to spread risk and potentially profit from various areas of the cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin whales predict a price decline, they can utilize short-term strategies to sell massive quantities of the cryptocurrency, scaring away smaller investors and further driving the market down. Conversely, they can use long-term strategies by strategically acquiring Bitcoin over time, which will generate positive momentum and encourage smaller investors to join the market, thus driving up the price. Stop-loss hunting includes the deliberate manipulation of the price of Bitcoin to trigger other traders\u2019 stop-loss orders, allowing whales to purchase at reduced prices before a market bounce. Whales frequently move funds secretly, using innovative methods to hide their identities and the amount of money they possess. Nevertheless, the transparency of blockchain and various Whale Alert platforms makes it possible to identify these whales. However, identifying them demands deep blockchain exploration and vigilant monitoring, termed on-chain analysis. Here are some ways to spot a Bitcoin whale swimming somewhere close. To obtain valuable insights and make informed investment decisions, traders and investors can closely monitor the actions of large Bitcoin holders \u2014 a process referred to as \u201cwhale watching.\u201d Large trades made by whales frequently cause abrupt drops or increases in price. When a large amount of cryptocurrency moves, it\u2019s often due to these whales transferring between wallets or exchanges. Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger can help access all whale transactions and identify large amounts of Bitcoin being moved. Identifying a whale\u2019s trading activity starts with analyzing patterns, particularly unusual ones. Spoofing is a notable pattern where traders place large orders with the intent to cancel them before they are executed. This tactic creates artificial market movements, misleading other traders and potentially manipulating prices. Another unusual pattern that is hard to spot is wash trading, where an investor takes both buy and sell positions on their orders, creating false signals of increased volume. While this may seem bullish, it often indicates artificial manipulation rather than genuine market demand. Detecting wash trading involves analyzing disproportionate trading volumes with minimal price movements. Some Bitcoin whales engage on social media, sharing their opinions on investment strategies. Monitoring platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) offer valuable cues into whale activities. However, barring the more vocal whales who often announce their holdings on social media, whales may operate pseudonymously or divide their holdings among multiple wallets to avoid drawing attention to their assets. If unexpected market movements occur without clear news or events to explain them, it could signal the presence of a whale swimming somewhere close. Whales usually trigger sudden changes in the crypto market by buying or selling large amounts of cryptocurrency. If a wallet or address with a significant BTC holding turns up, a whale might be present. Bitcoin whales often combine their holdings into a small number of wallets to facilitate asset management. For investors, keeping an eye on the activities of prominent cryptocurrency whales can prove to be a savvy strategy. It can provide valuable information about the sentiment of the market and could aid investors in identifying trends. Understanding whale behavior can help identify potential support and resistance levels in the market. However, it\u2019s crucial to avoid relying solely on Bitcoin whale actions, as they can manipulate markets for personal gain. When whales make significant trades, it can sway investor confidence and affect their emotional decisions not based on rational analysis, subsequently driving prices up or down. Another consideration is the information gap between whales and smaller traders, which can lead to unfair advantages. While whale watching can reveal trends such as the accumulation of Bitcoin or the distribution of assets, investors should conduct thorough research to avoid falling prey to pump-and-dump schemes. They should also exercise caution for informed decision-making.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #Adoption, #Trading, #How to"},{"date":"Mar 31, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/sec-s-spot-ether-etf-concerns-unfounded-consensys-asserts","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"SEC\u2019s spot Ether ETF concerns unfounded, Consensys asserts","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Consensys addressed the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s inquiry about potential fraud and manipulation risks related to Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) system, particularly concerning spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Sam Lehman, principal at Symbolic Capital, emphasized in a March 26 X post that robust crypto accelerators play a vital role in fostering community among founders within the network-centric Web3 sphere. Lehman highlighted the rise of new crypto accelerators driven by funds aiming to boost their brand and deploy capital quickly. However, he warned of potential predatory practices among some accelerators: \u201cSome accelerators are using the early stage at which they invest plus their proposed \u2018value-add\u2019 to come in and take extremely big positions in companies immediately.

Despite DeFi\u2019s promise to mitigate the risks associated with CEXs, its highly fragmented nature hinders widespread adoption. With over 3,000 protocols across 227 chains, the DeFi ecosystem presents a daunting landscape for even the most experienced investors, making it challenging to set up comprehensive strategies without significant investment in time and development resources. Thankfully, DeFi offers innovation faster than any other industry in recent history while becoming simpler, quicker and cheaper with each new step. The latest DeFi innovation has arrived in the form of Velvet Capital, a DeFi asset management platform that aims to simplify managing DeFi portfolio by allowing anyone to set up advanced DeFi strategies in minutes. The platform offers crypto users, traders, asset managers and fintech projects to launch tokenized funds and other DeFi products for themselves or their clients. Initially operating on BNB Chain, Velvet Capital has expanded to Arbitrum \u2014 a popular Ethereum layer-2 blockchain \u2014 to cover most DeFi space. Built as a \u201cDeFi operating system\u201d for asset management, Velvet Capital introduces an easy way to create a DeFi vault with all the back-end systems and technical aspects covered by the platform. A DeFi vault is a smart contract on the blockchain that manages users\u2019 funds based on predefined strategies to maximize returns. Vaults automate the process of earning yield on digital assets in various ways, such as staking, liquidity provision and employing other yield farming strategies.  The platform shows the asset allocation on a simplistic screen. Source: Velvet Capital Velvet Capital has developed an Intent-Based Trade Execution for smart order routing so that users benefit from optimal liquidity and capital efficiency. The smart order routing feature finds the best routes for trades \u2014 both for 1:1 and Many:Many swaps \u2014 by sending trade orders to a wide variety of integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXs), automated market makers (AMMs) and market makers. This enables users to get optimized gas fees and token prices when trading on Velvet Capital. Users can enter the vault creation module and deploy noncustodial or multisig tokenized vaults with a single click and pick the crypto assets they want to include. The process is fairly straightforward: Aside from the easy-to-use dashboard, Velvet Capital also serves business users, including fintech projects and traditional asset managers who are looking for a simplistic way to get into DeFi. Institutions can either use the web application to launch their vaults or go for Velvet Capital\u2019s white-label solution, which also brings extra benefits, such as assistance in adding custom assets \u2014 including real-world assets (RWAs). As a DeFi platform with several advanced features, Velvet Capital offers a surprisingly easy onboarding experience. Thanks to the solid integration network, users can sign in to the platform from a vast range of Web3 wallets. If you have a wallet from MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance or OKX, you\u2019re good to go. The refined v2 version of the dashboard then shows the Marketplace, a curated vault screen with top TVL vaults at the top. You can easily sort the vault order by TVL, APY or estimated returns. Seeing all this information on a single screen adds clarity when picking an existing vault. Vault creation, the main premise of the platform for power users, felt as easy as filling out a Google form. Since creating a vault is free (you don\u2019t have to deposit for creation), it\u2019s easy to try and flex your Web3 skills. Moreover, anyone creating or joining a vault is eligible for an upcoming airdrop. Once you join other vaults or create your own, it\u2019s easy to track the performance and yields from each vault under the My Portfolio tab. Aside from the user-friendly design, the platform has made a smart move by expanding the support to Arbitrum, which technically means digital assets from two of the top DeFi networks \u2014 Ethereum and BNB Chain \u2014 are available to Velvet Capital users. \u201cWe envision Velvet Capital as becoming a one-stop-shop for DeFi Investors to manage their portfolios,\u201d explained Michael Hage, the vice president of business development and growth at Velvet Capital. He added that as the team builds an omnichain infrastructure and expands through the DeFi ecosystem with new integrations, Velvet will make it easier for every DeFi user to navigate the market and find the best opportunities.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Assets, #Investments, #Decentralized Exchange, #DeFi, #DEX"},{"date":"Mar 30, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/u-k-court-freezes-6m-of-craig-wright-s-assets-amid-bitcoin-creator-claim","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"UK court freezes over $8M of Craig Wright\u2019s assets","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"A United Kingdom court has approved the freezing of 6.7 million British pounds ($8.4 million) of Craig Wright\u2019s assets to prevent him from evading court expenses.

However, Custodia claims it is not backing down and is exploring all possible avenues. \u201cWe are reviewing the court\u2019s decision and all of our options, including appeal,\u201d a spokesperson for Custodia Bank told Cointelegraph. In a March 29 filing, Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed Custodia\u2019s bid to secure a Federal Reserve master account. The account, often called \u201ca bank account for banks,\u201d facilitates financial institutions\u2019 access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s payment systems. Custodia contended that without a master account, it would be unable to offer the same custodial services for crypto-assets as other banking institutions, placing the bank at a disadvantage. \u201cWithout a master account, if Custodia is able to operate at all, it is a second-class citizen, relegated to dependency on and fealty to an intermediary bank,\u201d it argued. Furthermore, Skavdahl declared that Custodia is not entitled to have the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRBKC) decision overturned: \u201cCustodia is not entitled to its requested writ of mandamus compelling FRBKC to issue its master account, and summary judgment on Claim II must be granted in FRBKC\u2019s favor.\u201d Related: Federal Reserve lists CBDCs as one of 7 \u2018key duties\u2019 to Congress Custodia submitted an application for a Federal Reserve master account in October 2020.

The charges coincide with a civil enforcement case by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), alleging multiple violations by the exchange. The DOJ claims KuCoin handled over $5 billion in suspicious and criminal funds. Staying in the United States, another setback hit Coinbase on March 27. District Judge Katherine Failla denied the exchange\u2019s motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that similar transactions have previously been considered securities transactions. Coinbase sought an order to drop the case, challenging the SEC\u2019s authority over crypto exchanges. In the Philippines, the financial regulator decided to block local users\u2019 access to Binance on March 25, citing concerns over the firm\u2019s unlicensed operations in the country. According to the agency, the exchange offered leveraged trading services and crypto savings accounts to local users without licenses. Meanwhile, in Russia, Binance\u2019s successor, CommEx, has officially announced that it is shutting down operations and has halted deposits. The company acquired Binance\u2019s Russian business for an undisclosed amount in September 2023. Along with the exchanges\u2019 challenges, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, Goldman Sachs\u2019 clients returning to crypto, SWIFT\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials, and Mastercard\u2019s forecasts for remittances in Latin America. BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is on track to surpass the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings in about three weeks, given the current rate of inflows and outflows. As of March 22, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF held 238,500 Bitcoin (BTC) on its books, worth nearly $15.5 billion at current prices, with daily inflows averaging 4,120 BTC. In contrast, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust has 350,252 BTC worth $23 billion but is experiencing average daily outflows of $277 million or 4,140 BTC. In another ETF headline, asset manager Hashdex has officially joined the spot Bitcoin ETF market after completing the conversion of its futures ETF to hold spot Bitcoin. Hashdex renamed and converted its Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF to the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF with the ticker \u201cDEFI.\u201d Digital asset management firm Galaxy Digital has reported a net income of $296 million for 2023, marking a reversal after ending 2022 with a $1 billion net loss. The performance shift is due to the rising prices of major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The firm\u2019s assets under management grew from $1.7 billion to $5.1 billion in 2023 and nearly doubled in the first two months of 2024, reaching $10.1 billion by the end of February. The firm also reported $18.7 million in mining revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, a 31% increase over the previous quarter. \u201cOur average marginal cost to mine in the fourth quarter increased relative to prior quarters due to fewer opportunities to economically curtail our mining operations and a higher network hash rate,\u201d the company said in its statement. Goldman Sachs\u2019 clients have started to jump back into crypto, with renewed appetite stemming from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, told Bloomberg that many of his firm\u2019s largest clients had recently become active or were \u201cexploring getting active\u201d in the crypto sector. Goldman\u2019s options and futures offerings are the primary source of fresh demand, with hedge funds being the most involved among its clients, according to Minton. Goldman\u2019s clients use their derivatives primarily to gain exposure to crypto volatility and to make long-term predictions about prices, said the executive, adding that Bitcoin-related products stood as the most popular investment vehicles among active clients. The SWIFT messaging network has released the results of the second phase of sandbox testing for its CBDC interlinking solution, which it calls a connector. The project looked at four use cases, not all of which involved CBDC, according to the report it released on the test results. It experimented with digital trading with atomic (instantaneous) settlement using smart contracts. It connected tokenization platforms to facilitate atomic delivery versus payment and worked with financial infrastructure firm CLS Group to show the connector\u2019s capability of connecting existing foreign exchange infrastructures using CBDC.

According to reports from pseudonymous X user AstroBoy and Etherscan data, LENX Finance\u2019s founders, John Kim and a person simply known as Paul, had transferred over $10 million worth of treasury assets to a Binance account without clear justification, draining LENX wallets. On the protocol\u2019s Discord server, users have complained about the lack of communication since the transactions were first spotted on March 26, along with consistent transfers to Binance and messages about the suspicious withdrawals being removed. The protocol was launched in January 2024, promising to support native Bitcoin for yield generation or to borrow against it. According to CoinGecko, LENX\u2019s native token, LENX XD (XD), was valued at $0.26 in early January versus $0.02 at the time of writing. LENX is backed by the lending protocol Frax Finance. Cointelegraph reached out to both co-founders of LENX Finance but did not receive an immediate response. The Frax Finance team was not available for comment. Media company Flywheel DeFi reportedly spoke with Kim over a chat, but the co-founder declined to comment. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have much to say at the moment,\u201d Kim wrote. Paul\u2019s last Discord activity was on March 26, when he announced he was investigating the withdrawals. \u201cI\u2019m trying to investigate right now.\u201d According to reports on Discord, the LENX team was able to freeze the Binance account that received the funds, with $3 million in remaining funds safeguarded. An ongoing investigation is reportedly in progress over Kim\u2019s activities, while Paul is cooperating with legal efforts. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers suddenly withdraw all funds from a project or liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens or assets.

This surge narrowed the valuation gap with its main competitor, Ether (ETH), which posted a 5% gain during the same timeframe. However, mixed signals from on-chain BNB Chain data suggest that the rally may have stretched too far. Market analysts note that the cryptocurrency market\u2019s upward trend is closely linked to inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which experienced a setback in the week ending March 23. For the first time since the introduction of spot ETFs in January, these financial instruments saw a net outflow of $890 million. On a positive note, recent figures indicate a significant decrease in outflows from Grayscale GBTC fund, with only $104 million leaving the fund on March 28. In the first half of March, BNB\u2019s price soared by 61.7%, but this momentum reversed after reaching a peak of $645, corresponding to a market capitalization of $96.4 billion. For context, BNB hit an all-time high valuation of $116 billion in November 2021. Interestingly, the total value locked (TVL) on BNB Chain, which represents the total deposits in the network\u2019s smart contracts, was $15.7 billion at that peak but has since fallen to just $7.1 billion, a 55% reduction. It's important to recognize that the entire crypto market, particularly decentralized finance (DeFi), has contracted significantly since late 2021. Therefore, it\u2019s somewhat unfair to single out the decline in BNB Chain\u2019s TVL. For example, the total market data for all blockchains tracked by DefiLlama, which once reached nearly $205 billion, now stands at $155 billion, marking a 25% decrease. Hence, a detailed examination of BNB Chain\u2019s TVL, especially in comparison with direct competitors like Ethereum and Solana (SOL), is warranted. BNB Chain\u2019s smart contract deposits have fallen to their lowest since March 2021, down 10% over two months, in stark contrast to Ethereum\u2019s 8% TVL increase in ETH terms and Solana\u2019s TVL, which jumped 29% since Jan. 28, as reported by DefiLlama. TVL should not be the sole indicator of a blockchain\u2019s success. Many decentralized applications (DApps), including nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, games, decentralized bets, collectibles, and social networks, do not require substantial deposits. In the past week alone, nearly 2 million active addresses were engaging with DApps on the BNB Chain. BNB Chain\u2019s activity levels rival those of Ethereum\u2019s most active layer-2 networks, boasting a comparable number of active addresses. Notably, despite Solana\u2019s active addresses being 14% higher during the same timeframe, no blockchain other than Ethereum approaches the seven-day trading volume of BNB Chain, which stands at $12.4 billion. Moreover, while Solana and Ethereum saw their volumes decrease, BNB Chain's trading volume experienced an 11% uptick. Forecasting future trends in the cryptocurrency sector presents considerable challenges. A more reliable approach involves examining derivative metrics, such as the demand for leverage in BNB perpetual futures contracts, which serves as an indicator of market demand. A key metric to consider is the funding rate: a positive funding rate indicates a tendency among traders to apply leverage to their long positions. Related: Bitcoin to attract $1T from institutions amid \u2018raging bull market\u2019 \u2014 Bitwise exec The latest figures show that the demand for leveraged long positions has leveled off, with the 8-hour funding rate holding steady at around 0.03%, or about 0.6% weekly. Usually, when traders feel positive about the market, this rate can climb above 1.2% per week. So, despite BNB\u2019s price struggle with the $620 level, market sentiment remains optimistic.

Borderless is an early investor in Algorand, Blockdaemon and Securitize \u2014 the latter of which is BlackRock\u2019s new partner in a tokenized digital fund. The acquisition will also place Borderless in Latin America. \u201cWe are currently actively looking for Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Mexico,\u201d Borderless co-founder and managing partner David Garcia told Cointelegraph. For 2024, the venture firm expects cross-chain standardization to be the next chapter in the evolution of the crypto space. \u201cThe advent of modularity in blockchains is a long-term trend, and we anticipate new L1s, L2s, and even L3s will emerge. [...] For mainstream adoption, we believe Web3 needs an aggregation layer that can interoperate across any chain,\u201d Garcia said.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer-2 Morph has raised $19 million in a seed round led by DragonFly Capital with additional participation from Pantera Capital, Foresight Ventures, The Spartan Group, MEXC Ventures, Symbolic Capital, Public Works, MH Ventures and Everyrealm. The firm raised an additional $1 million secured in an angel round. The company plans to use the capital toward talent acquisition, developer incentives, and marketing efforts. The blockchain is built on three pillars: decentralized sequencers, optimistic zkEVM integration and modular design. \u201cBeing one of the first to launch with a decentralized sequencer on Ethereum is also an example of our commitment to decentralization from the beginning,\u201d said Morph co-founder and chief operating officer Azeem Khan. London-based Web3 decentralized AI startup FLock.io announced a $6 million Seed fundraising on March 28, co-led by Lightspeed Faction and Tagus Capital. The company aims to deploy its Federated Learning-powered Training Platform with the new funds, designed to decentralize AI agent training, fine-tuning, and inferencing while ending user data collection. \u201cNow, anyone can contribute knowledge and enrich AI models themselves. The result? Community-owned models built by the many, not just the few, with data contributors being fairly rewarded and far more use cases,\u201d said the startup in a statement. Keyring Network, founded by a former Nomura quant analyst and a J.P. Morgan investment banker in 2022, has secured $6 million in seed funding, co-led by Gumi Cryptos Capital and Greenfield Capital, with additional support from Motier Ventures, Kima Ventures, UDHC Finance, Eberg Capital and notable angel investors. The platform leverages zero-knowledge technology to address regulatory compliance and market liquidity for financial organizations, enabling private data sharing and identification of qualified participants for secondary market tokenized transactions. \u201cKeyring\u2019s asset-level solution is the most flexible ZK compliance tool catering to financial institutions\u2019 individual DeFi risk appetite.

The exchange offers self-custody trading of perpetual contracts \u2014 a type of futures contract without an expiry date, allowing traders to better employ risk management strategies. The funds will be used to support the development of the platform, which uses smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs. Rails was created as a result of the FTX collapse, said its co-founder Satraj Bramba in a statement. \u201cIn addition to getting rugged on FTX, the harder pill to swallow was the loss of the most efficient, productive trading environment we had ever used.

When Bitcoin (BTC) reached its 2024 peak (so far) and new all-time high, it briefly surpassed silver as the eighth most valuable commodity in the world by market capitalization. Related: Bitcoin price nails new $73.6K all-time high as ETFs eat away at supply In the current market situation, if one could fast-forward another year under the exact same growth rate, Bitcoin would reach a price of approximately $170,574 by the beginning of April 2025. This would put it ahead of silver today, as well as Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Saudi Aramco, Nvidia and Microsoft to take the second-place spot on CompaniesMarketcap\u2019s list of the top 100 commodities by capitalization. While this number only holds water when imagining a scenario where Bitcoin grows and the rest of the market remains static, today\u2019s market capitalizations can be used as a measuring stick for what Bitcoin\u2019s potential future growth could look like. If silver\u2019s market cap remains at its current value of $1.412 trillion, Bitcoin could surpass it again by increasing its current price point from $69,678 (as of the time of this article\u2019s publication) to $71,732. This would give Bitcoin a total market capitalization of approximately $1.413 trillion and sole possession of the eighth-place spot on the list. The Mountain View search giant currently has a market capitalization of $1.885 trillion, just $12 billion ahead of Amazon. Bitcoin can surpass them both and claim the sixth-place spot on the list by reaching a price of approximately $95,642 to surpass a market cap of $1.885 trillion. This would put it squarely behind Saudi Aramco, which currently sits in fifth place with a cap of $1.984 trillion. Fourth and third on the list are occupied by Nvidia and Apple, respectively. Bitcoin will have to reach a total market value of about $2.65 trillion in order to slide into third place and have a shot at knocking Microsoft out of its second-place slot. The number to beat there, if Bitcoin is to surpass Microsoft\u2019s $3.126 trillion cap and reach number two on the list, is approximately $165,608 per BTC. While this might seem lofty given its current price at just under $70,000, it\u2019s worth remembering that the price of Bitcoin increased by approximately 144.82% year over year from April 2023 through the end of March 2024. If Bitcoin increased by 144.82% in the next year, from its current value of $69,678, it would reach approximately $170,574. At this price, its market cap would be approximately $3.224 trillion, more than enough to overtake Microsoft. Once Bitcoin secures second place \u2014 again, assuming the entire market remained static and BTC\u2019s price alone rose \u2014its price would need to be approximately $800,476 per BTC to achieve a market cap of $15.15 trillion. This would beat gold\u2019s current cap of $15.141 trillion and give the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency the top slot on the market cap leaderboard.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Cryptocurrencies, #Apple, #Google, #NVidia, #Amazon, #Gold, #Bitcoin Price, #Silver, #Microsoft"},{"date":"Mar 29, 2024","summary":"","author":"Emre G√ºnen","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/web3-event-series-seeks-to-decentralize-giving-new-dao-control-of-treasury","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Web3 event series seeks to decentralize, giving new DAO control of treasury","type":"Blog","category":"Spotlight","content":" Short for Internet Computer Protocol Community Conference, the ICPCC 2024 event aims to connect the Web3 community globally and transition the community conference into a DAO. The contribution of online and offline events in addressing education, collaboration and innovation to the Web3 ecosystem cannot be ignored. Web3 events foster a sense of unity, allowing developers to shape the future of the decentralized world. One specific upcoming event is centered around Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a blockchain network known for addressing critical challenges such as scalability, security and interoperability. Rather than being an alternative to blockchains like Ethereum, ICP fills gaps within Web3 by automating cross-chain transactions without bridges. With ICP, a decentralized application (DApp) on any blockchain network can offer a user-friendly experience like the traditional web without sacrificing decentralization. ICP aims to enhance the power and usability of DApps across various blockchain networks. To celebrate this, the ICP Community Conference (ICPCC) intends to showcase the value ICP brings to the broader Web3 community as a multichain event brand centered around ICP tech. Slated for May 10 and organized by Code & State, a venture studio focused on ICP, the ICPCC 2024 seeks to connect Web3 enthusiasts, developers and thought leaders worldwide. The primary goal of the ICPCC 2024 is to underline the ICP protocol\u2019s capabilities and potential to integrate and add value to other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin and Solana. Unlike previous events focusing mainly on the ICP community, the 2024 iteration targets a broader Web3 audience to show how users can strengthen the chains they already use. In a move to decentralize the event, Code & State plans to transform the ICPCC into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) during the event. A DAO is a blockchain-based system that enables people to collaborate through consensus mechanisms without centralized leadership. As the organization transitions to an autonomous structure, participants will vote to elect the council members to shape proposals that will help the DAO manage the events. This council will present the first recommendations regarding 2025 ICPCC events in late 2024. ICPCC\u2019s first step is the formation of a fully independent Marshall Islands DAO limited liability company (LLC), which will relinquish control and copyright of its brand and entrust the organization\u2019s future to its community. Following this step, the decentralization sale will take place set to begin approximately a day before the event on May 10. Subsequently, the election of the ICPCC Council will take place roughly a month after May, entrusting them with the governance and future planning of the conference. During the third quarter of 2024, the council will be tasked with making strategic proposals for the first 2025 ICPCC event, ensuring adequate preparation time for the vendor to organize the event. Following the transformation in the organizational structure, all funds obtained from ticket sales and sponsorships will go to the DAO treasury under the management of tokenholders. By leveraging the event series, the community effectively creates a decentralized marketing arm for the Web3 ecosystem, showcasing a sustainable business model that supports ongoing promotion and development. Thus, the management of the event series will be completely under the control of the users. Inviting Web3 enthusiasts worldwide to discover how they can leverage the power of the Internet Computer Protocol, the ICPCC event targets more than 2,000 attendees. The event, where the best use cases of ICP will come to the fore, focuses on building a more interconnected and user-friendly decentralized ecosystem. Local meetups with ICP influencers, founders, and investors will feature several key opinion leaders from the crypto world. These include MC Blockchain Boy, William Laurent, Jerry Banfield, Blockchain Pill, Aaron Bremser and The Swop.  More than twenty ICPCC24 watch parties will be held worldwide. Source: ICPCC The ICPCC team believes people will derive real-world value from Web3, even if they don\u2019t know what a token or decentralization is. Its move to a community-focused DAO structure complements ICPCC\u2019s vision for a more user-friendly and accessible future. Web3 events are at the forefront of advancing a more user-friendly and interconnected decentralized ecosystem, showcasing a progressive stance on governance and community involvement. All blockchain-based events herald a future where decentralization is integrated into everyday digital experiences and where Web3 is accessible to everyone.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Event, #Adoption, #DAO, #Web3"},{"date":"Mar 29, 2024","summary":"","author":"Turner Wright","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/sam-bankman-fried-what-happens-now","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years \u2014 What happens now?","type":"Blog","category":"Follow up","content":"A federal judge sentenced former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried to 25 years behind bars for his multiple felony convictions, eliciting mixed reactions from many in and out of the crypto space. On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan had some harsh words for Bankman-Fried before and after announcing consecutive sentences of 240 months and 60 months, totaling 25 years in prison. The judge compared SBF to a \u201cthief,\u201d said his attempts to promote regulation of crypto was \u201can act,\u201d found he committed perjury and was \u201cwilling to flip a coin as to the continued existence of life on earth.\u201d The former FTX CEO has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since August 2023, when Judge Kaplan revoked his bail for intimidating witnesses in the criminal case. A March 28 docket entry for U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York suggested the judge would deduct time already spent in jail, meaning SBF would have a maximum of 291 months in prison \u2014 ending in 2048. According to Judge Kaplan, Bankman-Fried will serve the remainder of his time behind bars at a medium- or low-security prison in the San Francisco Bay Area. Reports suggested possible locations, including the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Herlong and FCI Mendota. It was unclear which one would house the former FTX CEO at the time of publication. Many reactions from social media following the March 28 hearing expressed doubt that Bankman-Fried would serve the entire sentence length. According to U.S. law, parole is no longer available for those sentenced to federal charges. However, inmates judged to have \u201cgood conduct\u201d can receive 54 days off their sentence for each year served. In Bankman-Fried\u2019s case, that would mean a reduction of roughly 3.75 years: 21.25 years served in total and less than 21 years after sentencing \u2014 presumably ending in 2045. The former CEO, now 32 years old, could be in his mid-50s even if he is released early for good behavior. Before Judge Kaplan announced the 25-year sentence, Bankman-Fried attorney Marc Mukasey said his team intended to appeal the jury\u2019s decision. The lawyers have 14 days to file the paperwork in court. Many from the crypto space suggested that 25 years in prison was \u201ctoo light\u201d for Bankman-Fried, given the impact on FTX users. However, some seemed to be surprised at the sentencing hearing, \u201cI say this would apply to [Alex] Mashinsky as well: I hope that neither actually have to be in prison until the day they literally die,\u201d said crypto influencer Tiffany Fong, who has provided many exclusives related to SBF\u2019s case. \u201cI personally wouldn\u2019t have supported a 40- to 50-year sentence because I think that would basically be a life sentence for someone who\u2019s 32 years old.\u201d Related: SBF memecoins pump and dump as FTX founder gets 25-year prison sentence \u201cThat is an insanely lengthy prison sentence, and I\u2019m not quite sure that he needs to be in prison for a quarter century,\u201d said Ana Kasparian, a host on progressive media outlet The Young Turks. \u201c25 years\u2026 I feel like that is the kind of prison sentence that you would save, or you would implement, toward a violent criminal who\u2019s a threat to the public.\u201d The FTX bankruptcy case is ongoing in the District of Delaware, where debtors have submitted a possible plan to repay users based on prices at the time of the exchange\u2019s collapse. Judge Kaplan also handed down an $11-billion forfeiture judgment as part of Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal case. \u201cThis forfeiture is designed to make certain that if SBF ever makes money, it goes not to him but to the government and the victims,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner, according to a March 29 CNN report. \u201cHe will never be able to accumulate funds in his life, and forfeiture cannot be eliminated through bankruptcy.\u201d Epner\u2019s statement suggested that should Bankman-Fried start a successful business making millions of dollars after his release, the government could go after these funds. The same could apply to a sudden windfall, making it less likely SBF will ever achieve the same financial status he had before November 2022.

Acheron Trading CEO Laurent Benayoun believes the current bull cycle has room to run and could top out between $120,000 and $180,000, buoyed by several factors such as the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, and the likely reduction in interest rates. Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan, who said in a memo to the investment professionals to \u201ckeep calm and take the long view.\u201d Hougan believes that if global wealth managers allocate 1% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, that could result in an inflow of roughly $1 trillion into the space. Although there are several bullish catalysts for Bitcoin to continue its rally in Q2 2024, trading firm QCP Capital cautioned that the current move was showing signs of exhaustion and the bulls may find it challenging to extend the uptrend. Could Bitcoin and altcoins correct in the near term, or will their rally continue? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin has been stuck inside a tight range of $71,770 and $68,359 for the past few days, suggesting indecision between the bulls and the bears. Generally, a tight consolidation near the highs is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are holding on to their positions and not rushing to the exit. The rising 20-day exponential moving average ($67,274) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have an edge. The BTC/USDT pair will resume its uptrend if the price breaks above the $71,770 to $73,777 resistance zone. That could open the gates for a rally to $80,000. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are booking profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($61,107). Ether (ETH) has been trading in a tight range near the $3,678 overhead resistance, suggesting a solid battle between the bulls and the bears. The flattish 20-day EMA ($3,527) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns up and breaks above $3,678, the ETH/USDT pair could climb to $4,100. The bears are likely to mount a strong defense at this level, but if the bulls come out on top, the rally could reach $4,500. Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below $3,460, it will signal that the bulls have given up. That could start a decline to the 50-day SMA ($3,324). This level is likely to attract buyers, but a weak bounce off it will enhance the prospects of a drop to $3,000. After struggling near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $588 for a few days, BNB (BNB) made a decisive move higher on March 28. If the price sustains above $588, the BNB/USDT pair could reach the overhead resistance of $645. This level may act as a hurdle, but if bulls overcome it, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $669 and eventually to $692. Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to fiercely defend the $645 level and yank the pair below the 20-day EMA ($552). That could start a deeper correction toward $495. Solana (SOL) is facing resistance at the downtrend line, signaling that the bears are trying to make a comeback. If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($175), it will tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The SOL/USDT pair could fall to $162 and below it to the 50-day SMA ($141). If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to kick the price above the downtrend line. The pair will then attempt to break above the stiff overhead resistance of $205. If that happens, the pair may start the next leg of the up move to $267. XRP (XRP) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($0.62) for several days, indicating uncertainty about the next directional move. If the price maintains below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the uptrend line. This is an essential level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could signal an advantage to the bears. The pair could then sink to $0.52. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if they drive the price above $0.69. That could clear the path for a rally to the formidable resistance at $0.74. The bears are trying to keep Cardano (ADA) below the breakout level of $0.68, which is a negative sign. If the price falls below $0.63, it will suggest that the ADA/USDT pair could remain range-bound between $0.68 and $0.57 for a few days. The 20-day EMA ($0.66) has started to slope down, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. The bulls will be in the driver\u2019s seat after the price rises and sustains above $0.70. If that happens, the possibility of a rally to $0.81 increases. The bears will be back in control on a break below $0.57, as that will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. Dogecoin (DOGE) has pulled back in an uptrend, suggesting that the traders are booking profits near the overhead resistance of $0.23. The DOGE/USDT pair could correct to the breakout level of $0.19. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That will increase the likelihood of a rally to $0.30. This positive view will be invalidated if the price dives below $0.19. That could open the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA ($0.17). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.13). Related: Here\u2019s what happened in crypto today Avalanche (AVAX) is finding it difficult to bounce off the support line of the pennant, indicating that the bears are keeping up the pressure. If the price plunges below the 20-day EMA ($53), the AVAX/USDT pair could drop to $50. This level may again attract buyers, but if the bears prevail, the pair could start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($46). Contrarily, if the price rebounds off the support line, the pair could reach the resistance line of the pennant. A break and close above the pennant will be the first sign of strength. The pair could then retest the stiff overhead resistance of $65. Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) relief rally is facing selling at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000032, indicating that the bears are trying to stage a comeback. If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000028), it will increase the risk of a fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.000021). Such a sharp decline is likely to delay the start of the next leg of the up move. Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. The SHIB/USDT pair could then rise to $0.000035 and thereafter to $0.000039. Toncoin\u2019s (TON) rebound on March 29 shows that the bulls are trying to defend the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.78. If the rebound sustains, the buyers will try to push the price toward the overhead resistance of $5.69. The upsloping moving averages suggest advantage to buyers, but the negative divergence on the RSI indicates that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. If the price turns down and breaks below $4.78, the selling could intensify, and the TON/USDT pair may slip to the 20-day EMA ($4.30). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a close below it will suggest a short-term trend change. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to the March 29 announcement, the novel Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) computation engine, dubbed \u201cSonic,\u201d will allow developers to deploy game engines or virtual machines of their choice on Solana via its software development kit (SDK) and power in-app transactions. At the same time, HyperGrid, the core technology of the Sonic SVM developed by Mirror World, enables gaming platforms to create their own on-ramp and cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators for Solana in-game interactions. Currently, the Mirror World SDK has been deployed to 50 gaming clients as initial distribution nodes. Three games, Mahjong Meta, Matr1x Fire and Seraph/ActozSoft, with over $30 million raised in their series rounds, have seen more than 200,000 traffic and transaction engagements generated during their gaming sessions after incorporating the Mirror World SDK. \u201cSonic provides natively integrated tools for payment & settlement infrastructure, as well as user engagement tools necessary to build a successful Web3 game,\u201d Mirror World wrote. Chris Zhu, CEO of Mirror World, explained that the firm has worked with hundreds of games within the Web3 ecosystem to aid in their monetization and listing. \u201cSonic\u2019s vision is to expand the existing Solana Gaming Ecosystem and process millions of requests per second per game and settle them back onto Solana L1,\u201d Zhu stated. Another of Mirror World\u2019s products, the Smart Marketplace SDK, allows developers to deploy a namesake nonfungible token marketplace within their decentralized application for $299 per month with a limit of $1 million in monthly transaction volume. Solana has emerged to become a top five blockchain by market cap with a gain of 824% over the past year. However, gaming activities on Solana have lagged so far in development relative to Ethereum, with the most popular game, MomoAI, having only 80,680 unique active wallets. That said, the blockchain is gaining traction in other initiatives. In February, Solana hit an all-time high of $5 billion in nonfungible token sales.

It\u2019s a Trojan horse way to say: look, you\u2019re letting in all these user-friendly DApps, and we won\u2019t even necessarily call them DApps [...] It\u2019s just Telegram Mini Apps that they\u2019re using whether that\u2019s inside their channels.\u201d Telegram Mini Apps launched in 2020 as an open platform allowing Web3 businesses to deploy crypto-friendly apps directly within the Telegram messaging app. They were launched in partnership with The Open Network (TON) Foundation and Tencent with the intention of creating a super-app platform. Bringing the next 500 million users on-chain will require simple initial use cases where users aren\u2019t necessarily aware of the underlying blockchain interaction. Hyun says: \u201cWe believe mass adoption really comes in the form of simple use cases in the beginning, and then there will be drop-offs of more sophisticated users going into different types of use cases.

But this may just be a harbinger of things to come. Expect more disruptions as Europe\u2019s path-breaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulatory regime takes effect at the end of June. Off-shore stablecoins, in particular, may face challenges. But in the long run, MiCA should provide a safer, stronger eco-system for stablecoin issuers and users, sources told Cointelegraph recently. As reported, Seychelles-based crypto-exchange OKX delisted Tether (USDT) trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) ahead of MiCA. \u201cMoving forward, only EUR and USDC trading pairs will be accessible for spot trading,\u201d said OKX in a customer support message. Market observers were hardly shocked by the news. Christian Catalini, the founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cryptoeconomics Lab, said he was \u201cnot surprised at all by the delisting,\u201d adding that \u201cthe stablecoin landscape will evolve substantially across the globe as new regulation is passed, and we will see entry by new players \u2014 many of which won\u2019t be companies that started in crypto and are coming from traditional banking and fintech.\u201d Regarding the OKX news, Arvin Abraham, partner at United Kingdom-based law firm Goodwin Procter, expects more of the same. He tells Cointelegraph: \u201cPost-MiCA [i.e., after June 30], if a stablecoin is no longer compliant, we can expect exchanges to drop it from the exchange for European customers.\u201d Because none of the world\u2019s largest stablecoins are European, it follows that in the EEA, at least, one could see \u201ca significant shifting of the landscape following MiCA coming into effect,\u201d suggested Abraham. Some of the current leaders may have to bow out if they won\u2019t, or can\u2019t, get compliant. Recent: Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations \u201cMiCA, with its stringent requirements for both e-money tokens and asset reference tokens\u201d [i.e., two forms of stablecoins in the new MiCA lexicon] will undoubtedly impact stablecoin offerings in the European Union,\u201d Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, global CEO at France\u2019s Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph, and \u201cwe are closely monitoring developments in this area.\u201d The challenge for stablecoin issuers is they will now need to be an EEA entity and authorized as an Electronic Money Institution firm in the EEA. \u201cThis is problematic for existing stablecoin issuances, and the timeline is now very short, with June 30, 2024, being the last date to meet the new regulatory requirements,\u201d Graftieaux added. \u201cFor non-European [stablecoin] issuers, the requirement for the issuer to have an entity established and authorized in an EU member state is the most significant unique cost,\u201d Abraham noted. But it isn\u2019t just off-shore issuers who will face challenges. \u201cFor all issuers, significant additional burdens come from the requirements to maintain 1:1 reserves to cover claims; provide permanent redemption rights to holders of tokens; and for stablecoins with a value exceeding 100 million euro to provide quarterly reporting to their EU home state regulator,\u201d Abraham added. Jon Helgi Egilsson, co-founder and chairman of Monerium, a company issuing compliant on-chain fiat stablecoins in Europe, and former chairman of the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Iceland, told Cointelegraph that most stablecoins offered in Europe today are not compliant with existing electronic money rules \u2014 let alone those that will be implemented June 30 as a result of MiCA. \u201cThe e-money directive has been in effect in Europe for more than 20 years,\u201d Egilsson said. \u201cWhy do you have a market of stablecoins where you have one set of companies that are compliant and one set of companies that are not compliant? That is not a fair thing.\u201d Still, he suggested that it could be \u201chugely expensive\u201d for some stablecoin issuers to come into compliance. With MiCA, fiat-backed stablecoin issuers will not only have to maintain a 1:1 ratio of liquid reserves, but they will also have to segregate user\u2019s funds, \u201cmeaning that the customer has a claim on the underlying funds,\u201d not the company, said Egilsson. Compliance demands will be greater for the larger market-cap issuers. \u201cIn the current [pre-MiCA] regulation and law, there is no distinction between the size of issuers,\u201d said Egilsson. The same rules apply to smaller and bigger issuers. However, MiCA distinguishes between \u201csignificant\u201d issuers and \u201cnon-significant\u201d issuers. \u201cYou have to put more of your own equity aside against potential losses if you are a \u2018significant\u2019 issuer,\u201d Egilsson explained. Will there be more changes for off-shore issuers? \u201cThe impact of the regulation may result in some challenges for those operating in international markets,\u201d said Graftieaux. \u201cFor example, it could result in increased compliance costs, barriers to market entry, and potential conflicts with other jurisdictions\u2019 regulatory frameworks, resulting in policy fragmentation.\u201d Abraham foresees \u201ca significant short-term disruptive effect on the market, as Tether is today the most popular stablecoin globally.\u201d However, over a longer time frame, \u201cother stablecoins would fill the void, and the ecosystem would arguably be safer as these coins would be compliant with MiCA\u2019s strict consumer protection and prudential safeguards.\u201d Crypto exchanges might have to adapt, too. \u201cSome exchanges require stablecoins as an intermediate form of exchange before fiat can be used to purchase crypto or to effect a trade between two crypto assets,\u201d said Abraham. Those stablecoins may not be available to them soon, at least for European customers. Still, Graftieaux emphasized the long-term benefits for investors and markets generally. \u201cWith a focus on market integrity and investor protection, these regulatory standards set an example for other markets, which, if followed, will only increase investor confidence.\u201d The MiCA framework has already had an impact in the U.K., Graftieaux added, where the government\u2019s commitment to digital assets has been widely seen \u201cas a clear strategic move to lead the international regulatory stage alongside the EU.\u201d Graftieaux also takes issue with those who claim that MiCA could thwart crypto and blockchain innovation in the EU countries. \u201cWhile innovation plays a crucial role in the industry, the importance of market stability cannot be overstated.\u201d Ultimately, the new framework \u201crecognizes the revolutionary ability of blockchain technology while also finding a balance in offering legal clarity and certainty,\u201d he continued. Moreover, \u201cThis harmonization encourages cross-border innovation through the seamless collaboration enabled between EU states.\u201d Graftieaux told Cointelegraph: \u201cThis cross-pollination of ideas will continue to foster technological innovation \u2013 just under a more robust set of regulations.\u201d Indeed, some on the continent see MiCA offering an opening for a new generation of stablecoin providers. \u201cWe cannot predict market reactions, but one thing is sure: MiCA is a real opportunity for Europe and euro stablecoins,\u201d Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO at France\u2019s Societe Generale \u2013 Forge, told Cointelegraph, adding: \u201cThe European market is dynamic, with a large, mature and sophisticated investor base. All the conditions are in place to allow a move toward rebalancing euro versus dollar stablecoins in the long term.\u201d In sum, with their focus on market integrity and investor protection, the new EU crypto regulations could set an example for other markets \u2014 after some short-term pain, of course. The stablecoin sector might also see some new entrants to challenge the dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins. Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s \u201cWhile MiCA is far from perfect, it provides a starting point for more robust stablecoin regulation. It\u2019s also way better than the current situation in the U.S., where there isn\u2019t any regulatory clarity and new rules are needed to deliver safe and sound stablecoins to consumers and businesses,\u201d said Catalini, adding: \u201cOnce there is clarity, we\u2019ll finally know which stablecoins are here to stay and which ones can actually solve real consumer and business needs at scale.\u201d","tags":"#Law, #Europe, #European Union, #Tether, #Stablecoin, #USD Coin, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 29, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-above-69-000-largest-quarterly-options-expiry","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin trades above $69K following largest quarterly options expiry in history","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The Bitcoin (BTC) price remained above the $69,000 mark on March 29 despite the market experiencing the biggest quarterly Bitcoin futures options expiry event in history.

Polygon-based crypto gambling site Polymarket shows that traders have placed \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d bets on whether a spot Ether (ETH) ETF application will be approved before May ends. Over $2.4 million worth of bets have been placed, with about 81% pessimistic about the chances of a spot Ether ETF approval before the deadline. Crypto traders buy yes or no shares depending on their predictions of how they expect things to go. The share\u2019s value represents the odds of the bet and changes similarly to how the crypto market goes. At the moment, the cost of a Yes share is $0.19, while No is worth $0.81, meaning fewer gamblers believe in the chances of spot ETH ETFs being approved by the end of May. The top trader for Yes holds about $84,000 worth of shares, while the top holder for No has around $127,000 in No shares. If the SEC approves a spot Ether ETF before the betting market\u2019s deadline of May 31, 2024, at 11:59 pm Eastern Time, the market will resolve, meaning that holders of Yes shares can cash out their earnings. However, the opposite also applies if there are no approvals before the deadline.

A fake token with the same name as Ethena Labs's ENA token has been exploited for 480 BNB (BNB) tokens worth $290,000 on the Binance launch pool for farming. The vulnerability behind the exploit is still unknown. On-chain security firm PeckShield reported the incident at 8:31 am UTC on March 29 in an X post, mistaking the fake token for the real ENA token. Ethena Labs\u2019s ENA token was announced on the Binance Launchpool on March 29. The exploit of the fake token, which is unrelated to Ethena Labs, occurred a few hours after the announcementing listing, causing widespread confusion. Ethena Labs launched its USDe synthetic dollar on the public mainnet on Feb. 19. Ethena became the highest-earning decentralized application (DApp) in crypto on March 8, when it offered investors an annual percentage yield (APY) of 67%. In terms of total sum, the exploit is on the smaller side of crypto hacks. The attack occurred a day after the over-$11-million Prisma Finance hack on March 28. Crypto hacks are a long-standing issue in the industry, eroding investor trust. Over $200 million worth of crypto has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 2024 across 32 individual incidents up to Feb. 29, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi. The over-$200-million loss represents a 15.4% increase compared to January and February 2023, when $173 million of digital assets were stolen. A total of $1.8 billion was lost to crypto hacks and scammers in 2023, 17% of which can be attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, according to a Dec. 28 report by Immunefi.

Traders appear to be heavily securing their positions in anticipation of the BCH halving, which is scheduled for April 4, according to NiceHash data. On March 28, $190,140 was liquidated in short positions and $211,870 in long positions. On the same day, open interest (OI) in Bitcoin Cash futures perpetual contracts reached all-time highs of $708.75 million, spiking 18.26% in 24 hours and 165% over the past 7 days, as per CoinGlass data. The last instance nearing this level was in May 2021, with OI reaching $684.12 million, coinciding with BCH reaching its highest price in the past five years at $1,399. This is in contrast to the same date in 2020, where futures open interest stood at $63.29 , just before the first-ever BCH halving on April 8, 2020. At the time, miner rewards halved from 12.5 BCH to 6.25 BCH. However, miners seem to be taking this as a cue to increase their mining efforts ahead of the upcoming halving. A user on X, \u201cDavidShares,\u201d told his 17,900 followers that the Bitcoin Cash hash rate has doubled in the past week. Hash rate is the measure of the total computational power used for mining and processing transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, measured by the number of hashes generated.

BCH halving occurs slightly earlier than Bitcoin halving due to Bitcoin Cash temporarily using a different algorithm to adjust its mining difficulty back in 2017, therefore speeding up the block creation time.

The comments came in his latest blog post on March 28, reflecting on the year ahead following Ethereum\u2019s latest Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced transaction fees for rollups on layer 2s. Buterin noted that Ethereum was in the \u201cprocess of a decisive shift\u201d from a \u201cvery rapid L1 progress era\u201d to an era where layer-1 progress will still be very significant. He also said that Ethereum\u2019s scaling efforts have shifted from a \u201czero-to-one\u201d problem to an incremental problem, as further scaling work will focus on increasing blob capacity and improving rollup efficiency. He continued to state that the ecosystem\u2019s standards will need to become stricter, adding: \u201cBy the end of the year, I think our standards should increase and we should only treat a project as a rollup if it has actually reached at least stage 1.\u201d Stage 1 is Buterin\u2019s classification of layer 2\u2019s decentralization progress, whereby a network has advanced enough in terms of security and scaling but is not yet fully decentralized (which would be Stage 2). He observed that only five of the layer-2 projects listed on L2Beat are at either Stage 1 or 2, and only Arbitrum is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible. The next steps on the roadmap include implementing data availability sampling to increase blob capacity to 16MB per slot and optimizing layer-2 solutions through techniques such as data compression, optimistic execution and improved security. \u201cAfter this, we can cautiously move toward stage 2: a world where rollups truly are backed by code, and a security council can only intervene if the code \u2018provably disagrees with itself,\u2019\u201d he added.

MicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor, would likely beg to differ. \u201cThe days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to Bitcoin are long over,\u201d Kerrisdale Capital explained in a March 28 analyst note, adding it believes MSTR price is overvalued. The firm noted it had short positions on the MicroStrategy stock. \u201cWe are long bitcoin and short shares of MicroStrategy, a proxy for bitcoin which trades at an unjustifiable premium to the digital asset that drives its value.\u201d MSTR is currently trading at $1,704. Over the last month, it saw a growth of 66.65%, and over the past six months, it has experienced an increase of approximately 419%. On the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s price currently stands at $70,849. It has had a one month increase of 15.8%, and soared 163.31% over the past six months. \u201cShares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,\u201d it stated. It also pointed out MicroStrategy's increasing debt-to-asset ratio and limited cash flow, which amounted to just $10 million in 2023 from its \u201csleepy\u201d software analytics business. This made up only 3% of the company's overall enterprise value. However, Saylor has said on several occasions that he remains confident his company would continue to be an attractive offer for investors. In December, Saylor told Bloomberg TV that his company would still offer a high-performance vehicle for people who are Bitcoin-long investors. \u201cThe ETFs are unlevered and they charge a fee,\u201d Saylor told Bloomberg. \u201cWe provide you leverage, but we don\u2019t charge a fee.\u201d Saylor also recently announced that MicroStrategy is undergoing a rebrand as a \u201cBitcoin development company.\u201d In a Feb. 12 interview with CNBC, Saylor explained that \u201cit is a natural decision for us given the success of our Bitcoin strategy, and our unique status as the world\u2019s largest public company holder.\u201d MicroStrategy holds 214,246 Bitcoin, as per data from Bitcoin Treasuries. This is approximately a 54% increase from its holdings of 138,955 Bitcoin this time last year. Saylor added that MicroStrategy, as an operating company, has more flexibility in managing its capital and operations than an investment trust. \u201cWe\u2019re going to develop software, we\u2019re going to generate cash flow, we\u2019re going to leverage the capital markets, all in order to accumulate more Bitcoin for our shareholders, and also to promote the growth of the Bitcoin network,\" he stated. On March 19, Cointelegraph reported that MicroStrategy sold another $604 million in convertible notes to buy an additional 9,245 BTC. Related: Bitcoin is more of a \u2018billion-dollar building in cyberspace,\u2019 argues Saylor Kerrisdale Capital says it remains bullish on Bitcoin, claiming it provides much better direct value for investors.

The firm also revealed it has long positions in two newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). It claimed that shareholders would find equivalent value in owning Bitcoin directly rather than holding MSTR stock at this stage. \u201cShareholder value creation has been overwhelmingly driven by simple bitcoin price appreciation \u2013 much as it would from owning bitcoin outright.\" Despite MicroStrategy seeing significant growth in its stock over the past 12 months, it declined approximately 11.18% on the day.

A white hat hacker refers to a person who uses their hacking ability to find security vulnerabilities in software code. In the broader cybersecurity world, these security experts often notify the creator of the attack vector rather than exploiting it themselves.

The first batch of malicious transactions occurred at 11:29 am UTC on March 28. Prisma Finance is still investigating the root cause of the attack. Blockchain security firm PeckShield estimated about $11.6 million was stolen and sent to three separate addresses. The hacker then started swapping the stolen funds to Ether (ETH), according to blockchain security firm Cyvers. PeckShield later observed about 200 Ether was transferred to OFAC-sanctioned cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. Prisma Finance engineers have since halted the DeFi protocol. Prior to the exploit, Prisma Finance had about $220 million in total value locked on its protocol, but that figure has plummeted to $115 million, according to DeFiLlama.

In 2023, crypto ATM installs had their first-ever yearly decline in a decade, owing to a bear market likely exacerbated by the collapse of several crypto firms. However, Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz notes that 2024 has already started with a bang, with 1,469 crypto ATMs installed in just the first three months, compared to the over 3,000 removed by around the same time in 2023, according to data from CoinATMRadar. \u201cIt\u2019s looking really positive that the industry continues to see a lot of growth in kiosk count,\u201d Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Cointelegraph. Mintz is now tipping an industry-wide ATM rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) back in swing, which has already twice beaten its all-time high in March. In past bull markets, Mintz noted that \u201clater in the cycle, especially that period of FOMO that starts happening,\u201d is when crypto adoption surges and, with it, brings more customers. \u201cThe adoption rate is really helpful because if more people are buying Bitcoin, then a portion of those are likely going to Bitcoin ATMs.\u201d That, however, typically comes later in the cycle and \u201cit\u2019s still pretty early,\u201d according to Mintz. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even at the halving yet,\u201d he said, mentioning the event slated for late April when Bitcoin\u2019s mining rewards are cut 50%. \u201cIn the past, more of the uptick we\u2019ve seen has been after the halving,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter the halving is when the price skyrockets the most, and that\u2019s when the FOMO phase starts.\u201d While the ATM count has recently climbed, Mintz claims over the past 18 months, the number of ATM operators has dropped. One of the largest was the 5,000 ATM-strong operator Coin Cloud, which went bankrupt in February 2023. \u201cA lot more of them were struggling and went out of business than was shown publicly,\u201d he said. The drop \u201chappened pretty quickly\u201d after crypto exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022 and took the crypto market with it, he added. Bitcoin Depot\u2019s fourth quarter and full 2023 results released on March 25 saw full-year revenues up 7% year-on-year to $689 million, though net income dropped 54% to $1.6 million. It also bought 900 ATMs to install in the first quarter of 2024 and has plans for 940 ATMs to go live in convenience stores in 24 United States states. According to CoinATMRadar, the Bitcoin ATM operator shares the market with a small number of other operators. The runner-up rival operator Coinflip has just over half that with over 4,200, while Bitstop is third with over 2,500. Of the 37,001 crypto ATMs in the world, the United States is home to nearly 83% of them, with over 30,600, per CoinATMRadar. In January, the U.S. also approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which some have hailed as an adoption catalyst for institutions and retail punters looking to get into Bitcoin. Mintz was unshaken by what impact the ETFs could have on Bitcoin ATMs. \u201cWe view it as a totally different customer base,\u201d he said. Related: Bitcoin ATM flaw could\u2019ve given hackers \u2018total control\u2019 \u201cA large portion of our customer base transacts primarily in cash or only in cash because they\u2019re underbanked or unbanked,\u201d he added.

Instead, he thinks the ETFs driving Bitcoin\u2019s price higher could mean more ATM usage as Bitcoin adoption climbs. \u201cIf adoption increases, we think it likely translates to increased usage of Bitcoin ATMs. So in the grand scheme of things, I think it is way more helpful to us in our industry than it is in terms of impacting us in a negative way.\u201d Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?","tags":"#Bitcoin, #ATM, #Business, #CoinATMRadar, #Adoption"},{"date":"Mar 28, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/how-high-can-bitcoin-go-180k-btc-price-prediction","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"How high can Bitcoin go? New BTC price prediction sees cycle top at $180K","type":"Blog","category":"Markets News","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) price could gain another 150% during the current bull market cycle, according to Laurent Benayoun, the CEO of Acheron Trading and quantitative trading strategies expert. The executive anticipates a potential cycle top of $180,000 for BTC price, based on a combination of factors, including the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the new supply reduction from the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Benayoun explained: \u201cIf we look at historical performance, with every cycle the multiple on the all-time is getting lower. So if we apply this reasoning it could be 2x to 3x what we saw in the previous cycles, so let's say around $120,000 to $180,000 per unit.\u201d Improving financial policy in the United States will also contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation, according to Benayoun: \u201cThe market is pricing in a reduction in interest rates because they have been flatlining, so it\u2019s reasonable to expect them to go down in the near future.\u201d Benayoun\u2019s prediction is in line with several other recent forecasts. Bitfinex analysts, for instance, see price reaching $120,000 by the end of 2024, according to a research report shared with Cointelegraph: \u201cOur analysis forecasts a conservative price objective of $100,000-$120,000 to be achieved by Q4 2024, and the cycle peak to be achieved sometime in 2025 in terms of total crypto market capitalization. The ETFs have introduced passive demand which means demand is coming from investors that is largely price agnostic.\u201d Meanwhile, wealth management giant Bernstein expects Bitcoin to break out to around $150,000 following the halving by mid-2025.

This is the latest step in the United States-based company\u2019s withdrawal from the U.S. market. Oregon is at least the fifth state to take action against the companies that make up the Abra ecosystem. The state of Oregon charged Abra with violations of state securities laws in connection with its interest-bearing crypto depository accounts Abra Earn and Abra Boost. It required Abra to advise all account holders in the state to remove their crypto assets from the platform. If it succeeds in returning all assets to Oregon customers by April 25, it will not be subject to a monetary penalty. In Oregon, 167 Abra customers have $32,387.14 on the platform. The state of Iowa settled with Abra and its CEO in February, and Abra agreed to return $6,426.90 to its approximately 39 customers in that state. It would avoid a penalty of $461,610.14 by fulfilling the conditions of the settlement by March 6.

While some market participants attribute the limited upside to uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved in the U.S., others contend that the surge in Ether futures open interest indicates strong demand from institutional investors. The debate continues over the implications of the indictment by the United States Justice Department against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin. On one hand, the indictment is viewed as a negative for the industry due to the resulting tighter regulatory landscape. However, some argue that this event actually improves the prospects for the approval of a spot Ether ETF by May 25, the date by which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue its final decision. A complaint filed on March 26 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against KuCoin for illegal trading activities notably identified Bitcoin (BTC), Ether, and Litecoin (LTC) as \u201cdigital assets that are commodities,\u201d falling firmly under the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction. This stance appears to directly challenge the SEC\u2019s assertions that Ether could be considered a security. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink remarked in a March 27 interview on FOX Business that listing an Ether ETF could still be feasible even if the asset is classified as a security by regulators, as reported by Unchained Crypto. Meanwhile, in a March 27 update on the X social network, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart reiterated his prediction of a denial in May, noting that the CFTC has recognized Ether as a commodity since at least February 2021, \u201cwhen they allowed CME Ethereum futures to begin trading.\u201d The growth of the Ether futures market is undoubtedly a positive development, as increased liquidity, particularly in the regulated Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market, facilitates participation by hedge funds and large asset managers. However, the fact that aggregate Ether futures open interest achieved a new record high on March 28 should not be immediately interpreted as a bullish indicator. It is important to note that Binance leads the pack, amassing $4.55 billion in ETH futures market positions, with Bybit trailing at $2.4 billion. Meanwhile, the open interest in CME Ether futures currently sits at $1.3 billion. Thus, attributing the recent surge solely to institutional investor interest would be oversimplifying the matter. Moreover, in every derivatives market, the volume of long positions, those wagering on a price increase, invariably equals the volume of short positions, those betting on a decline. However, the demand for leverage can serve as an indicator of the market's bullish or bearish sentiment. Perpetual contracts, or inverse swaps, include a rate that adjusts based on the demand imbalance for leverage. A positive funding rate indicates increased demand for bullish leverage positions, whereas a negative rate suggests a preference for bearish positions. Recent data indicates a rise in the demand for leveraged long positions in ETH, with the current funding rate at 0.04%, or roughly 0.8% on a weekly basis. Typically, rates above 1.2% per week signal excessive optimism, suggesting that traders are presently moderately bullish. To gauge professional traders\u2019 sentiment more accurately, one should examine data from the Ether options market. The 25% delta skew provides insight into whether arbitrage desks and market makers are charging more for upward or downward protection. Specifically, a skew metric above 7% suggests expectations of a price decline, whereas excitement in the market usually results in a negative skew below -7%. Related: Covered call options strategy, explained The Ether option delta skew indicates balanced pricing between call and put options, aligning with a neutral market stance. However, a comparison with data from March 21, when the ETH skew metric showed signs of optimism, suggests that traders are now less optimistic about Ether's potential to surpass the $3,800 mark.

In the same time,Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market dominance increased by 0.1% to 51.56%, as the upcoming Bitcoin halving and bullish market structure encourage traders. Leading the gains are Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), which have risen approximately 3% and 1.5% in the same period. Let\u2019s explore the reasons why the crypto market is up today. The crypto market recovered on March 28 after comments from a member of the Federal Reserve Board, Christopher Waller, which killed the hopes of any interest rate cuts in June. Markets seem to be gearing up for no interest rate cuts in the coming months while inflation intensifies. The CME FedWatch Tool now sees a 94.8% possibility of keeping the Fed funds rate unchanged in May, while chances of a rate cut are at 5.2%. Meanwhile, the busy economic calendar for March 28 adds to the tailwinds with the increasing Continuing Claims contradicting the positive U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data. According to data from Marketwatch, the U.S. GDP reading for Q4 showed an increase from 3.2% to 3.4%. The GDP price index remains unchanged at 1.7%. While this week\u2019s Jobless Claims remained stable at 211,000, Continuing Claims spiked to 1.819 million, down from 1.795 million the previous week. Diverging and unclear data points leave traders nervous about the state of the economy. The total crypto market capitalization has been increasing since Jan. 22, rising 81% to reach a high of $2.721 trillion on March 14. Profit-booking across the board resulted in an 18% decline in this value to $2.208 trillion. The value has now recovered and rests 6% below the 27-month peak. This has led to a V-shaped recovery pattern on the daily chart, reinforcing the recent strong momentum in backing the rally in crypto prices. The daily relative strength index (RSI) is positioned above the mid-line at 59, suggesting that the bulls are regaining control of the market. The crypto market faces a market cycle different from previous bull runs. This can be attributed to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving. On March 27, net capital flows into all the spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $243.5 million, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recording the highest inflow at $323.8 million. Grayscale\u2019s converted GBTC fund saw another day of outflows totaling $300 million. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has increased institutional exposure to Bitcoin, and with continued inflows into these investment products, the market remains bullish. Market participants are also optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s potential upside before and after the halving event in April. Market intelligence firm Santiment posted the following chart on X, noting that the record highs witnessed in U.S. equities and gold are \u201ccreating a #bullish divergence for $BTC and #altcoins.\u201d Santiment added, \u201cWith $ BTC\u2019s whales accumulating big this week and the #halving just three weeks out, this increased optimism and today\u2019s perpetual contract funding rate increase on #Binance may have some merit to predicting where #cryptocurrency goes next.\u201d In addition to spot BTC ETF inflows and the upcoing halving, retail investors appear to be entering the market.

Accounting for the biggest portion of on-chain activity throughout the last year, blockchain gaming has the potential to enjoy the upcoming bull season from the first row. However, the so-called \u201ccrypto spring\u201d will also be a determining time for the majority of blockchain projects regarding whether they continued to build during the bear market or just tried to get on the hype train. Web3 games that struggle with their in-game economy and are unable to deliver quality gameplay are doomed to be left behind as the Web3 community, both newcomers and experienced blockchain users, continue to move forward with new and exciting projects. Alaska Gold Rush (AGR) is a multi-product Web3 project developed by Baked Games, an independent gaming studio with a decade of experience. It seeks to combine traditional gaming with blockchain technology and an engaging game lore. Using the historic Klondike Gold Rush era of the late 1890s as its setting, AGR introduces the players to an open world through the first-person perspective to offer an immersive experience where they can explore the harsh yet beautiful landscapes of Alaska, mine gold and compete with other players in duels. Players can get crucial in-game items, including pickaxes, weaponry and land, as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) while facing the dangers of Alaska along their adventures. The CARAT tokens stand at the core of the game\u2019s play-to-earn (P2E) mechanics.  The game introduces an engaging story set during the Gold Rush era. Source: Alaska Gold Rush As players dig out in-game GOLD tokens from the rivers and mines of Alaska with their NFT-powered equipment, they will have the opportunity to convert the gold into CARAT tokens, with the latter having real-world value. Users can equip their character with new gear and weapons from the local store at a fixed price or they can check the upcoming in-game NFT marketplace to find better prices from other players. Following the closed beta test of the Alaska Gold Rush Arenas, the first title of the AGR universe, the Baked Games team plans a public launch with player-versus-player (PvP) elements as Season 1 of AGR. The second season will see the launch of a marketplace, new battle royale maps and a team deathmatch mode through the first half of 2024.  Players need to survive the harsh environment of Alaska while seeking gold. Source: Alaska Gold Rush A single-player campaign, also known as the player-versus-environment (PvE) mode, and new maps will premiere later this year. Equipped with the long-term vision of creating an ecosystem that spans multiple products where players can \u201cspend quality time, socialize, trade and compete with their friends,\u201d Baked Games seeks to create a world revolving around treasure hunting and fortune-building that goes far beyond the state of Alaska. Blending innovative technology with immersive storytelling promises a future where Web3 gaming becomes a digital journey into uncharted territories. Unique gaming experiences powered by blockchain and NFTs are set to redefine engagement, transforming players from mere participants to architects of their own adventures.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Adoption, #Games, #Blockchain Game, #Web3, #Gaming, #Token"},{"date":"Mar 28, 2024","summary":"","author":"Tristan Greene","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/web3-ad-nft-service-everyworld-reaches-225-k-users","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Web3 ad service Everyworld reaches 225K users within a month of launching beta","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Web 3 advertising service platform Everyworld has reached a total user base of 225,000 as of March 28.

In a March 28 hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced the former FTX CEO to 300 months in prison for his conviction related to misusing customer funds. Prosecutors had suggested up to 50 years in prison for SBF, while his defense attorneys requested the judge be lenient and only impose up to 6.5 years. The judge added the former CEO had committed perjury and intimidated witnesses. Immediately following the announcement in the New York courtroom, crypto users jumped onto social media to express their thoughts. Many suggested that 25 years wasn\u2019t enough time given longer sentences handed down for seemingly less serious crimes. \u201c[The judge] gave him less than Chelsea Manning (35 years) for a waaaaay worse crime,\u201d said Edward Snowden on X, referring to Manning\u2019s 2013 conviction for violations of the Espionage Act. Though the sentencing guidelines allowed Judge Kaplan to put SBF in prison for more than 100 years, many pointed out before the hearing that this outcome was unlikely. Several legal experts speculated Bankman-Fried would serve between 10 and 30 years, and others suggested it may be an effective deterrent for figures in the crypto space. \u201cJudge Kaplan weighed all of the sentencing factors, including the magnitude of the crime, his conclusion that SBF lied on the witness stand and tampered with a witness, and handed down a serious sentence,\u201d Mark Bini, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, told Cointelegraph. \u201cWhile less than the prosecutors\u2019 request for 40-50 years, it is a very significant sentence and sends a message that people convicted of crimes in the crypto space will face serious consequences.\u201d Swan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang largely disagreed, telling Cointelegraph \u201cjustice is not served\u201d and 25 years was \u201ctoo light\u201d based on the number of suicides in the wake of the collapse of FTX, SBF\u2019s perjury, and the misuse of user funds. \u201cThe damage SBF did was permanent and severe,\u201d said Yang. \u201cHe ruined a lot of families and lives with his felonious acts and put salt in the deep wounds with his total lack of remorse.

After five days of successive net outflows last week, demand bounced back sharply with $418 million in net inflows into the ETFs on March 26 and $243 million inflows on March 27, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview with Fox Business that he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d with the performance of the firm\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, which was the \u201cfastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs.\u201d Fink added that he was \u201cvery bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin.\u201d On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant said in its latest \u201cWeekly Crypto Report\u201d that Bitcoin\u2019s demand skyrocketed from \u201c40K Bitcoin at the start of 2024 to 213K Bitcoin\u201d on March 26. That could create a \u201csell-side liquidity crisis\u201d within the next year. Could Bitcoin continue its recovery and hit a new all-time high before the Bitcoin halving? Will that trigger buying in altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin witnessed profit booking on March 26 and 27, but a positive sign is that the bulls maintained the price above the pennant. The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($67,069) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $73,777, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $80,000. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it could open the doors for a potential drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($60,629). Ether (ETH) is facing selling near $3,678, but a positive sign is that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($3,530). If the price breaks above $3,678, the possibility of a rally to $4,100 increases. This level may act as a stiff hurdle, but if the buyers prevail, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to $4,500 and then to $4,868. Conversely, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below $3,460, it will suggest that the bears are not willing to give up. The pair may then slip to the 50-day SMA ($3,302). A slide below this support could start a deeper correction. The long wick on BNB\u2019s (BNB) March 25 and 26 candlestick shows that the bears are defending the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $588. If the price turns down from the current level, the BNB/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($546). This remains the critical level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the pair will again attempt to rise above $600 and reach $645. On the other hand, if the price drops below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. The pair could then drop to the critical support at $495. The bulls may aggressively buy the dips to this level. Solana\u2019s (SOL) recovery is faltering at $196, indicating that the bears are selling on relief rallies near the overhead resistance of $205. The bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($173), which is a crucial level to keep an eye on. If the price plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the bears are in the driver\u2019s seat. The SOL/USDT pair could decline to $162 and below that to the 50-day SMA ($140). Instead, if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate solid demand at lower levels. That will enhance the prospects of a break above $205. If that happens, the pair may start its journey to $267. XRP (XRP) has been stuck between the uptrend line and $0.67 for the past few days, indicating indecision among the buyers and sellers. If the price maintains below the 20-day EMA ($0.62), the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the uptrend line. A strong rebound off this level will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $0.67 or on a drop below the uptrend line. Above $0.67, the pair could start a rally to the formidable hurdle at $0.74. On the downside, a break below the uptrend line could sink the pair to $0.52. The long wick on Cardano\u2019s (ADA) March 26 candlestick suggests that the bears are trying to keep the price below $0.68. If the price remains below the moving averages, it will signal that the ADA/USDT pair could swing between $0.57 and $0.68 for a while. The flattening 20-day EMA ($0.66) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a consolidation in the near term. However, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $0.70, it will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may then attempt a rally to $0.81, where the bears may pose a strong challenge. Dogecoin (DOGE) soared above the $0.19 to $0.21 overhead resistance zone on March 28, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. There is a minor resistance at $0.23, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to $0.30 and then to $0.35. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly pull the price back below $0.19. If they do that, it will trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in long liquidation. The pair could then slump to the 20-day EMA ($0.16). Related: Bitcoin whales copy classic bull market moves as BTC price eyes $72K Avalanche\u2019s (AVAX) price action of the past few days has formed a pennant, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($52) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight advantage to buyers. The bulls will try to defend the support line of the pennant and push the price toward the resistance line. A break and close above the pennant will signal that the AVAX/USDT pair could resume the uptrend. The pair may rise to $65 and later to the pattern target of $76. Alternatively, if the price breaks below the pennant, it will suggest that the bears have overpowered the bulls. There is strong support at $50, but if this level gives way, the pair could tumble to the 50-day SMA ($45). Shiba Inu\u2019s (SHIB) recovery climbed above the resistance line on March 26, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The SHIB/USDT pair is likely to rise to $0.000035 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense. A break above this level could open the doors for a possible rise to $0.000039. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000028). If that happens, it will suggest that the break above the resistance line may have been a bull trap. The pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.000021). Toncoin (TON) is correcting in an uptrend, but the pullback is finding support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $4.78, signaling buying on dips. The upsloping moving averages suggest an advantage to the bulls, but the developing negative divergence on the RSI points to a possible consolidation or correction in the short term. If the price turns down and slips below $4.78, it will indicate selling on rallies. The TON/USDT pair could sink to the 20-day EMA ($4.22). Contrarily, if the rebound sustains, the rally could reach the stiff overhead resistance of $5.69. A break above this level will signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend toward $7.15.

The blockchain ecosystem has grown into a trillion-dollar industry with the rise of cryptocurrencies. As the blockchain space expanded and evolved, the smart contract functionality gave birth to thousands of DApps, which are decentralized Web3 applications made possible by blockchain. The multitude of blockchain networks and DApps, along with core promises of blockchain such as decentralization, raises a fundamental question: How can blockchains be rendered to communicate and work together? Since blockchains are not inherently interoperable, the fragmented ecosystem swarms with diverse layer-1 and layer-2 networks. Achieving seamless integration between blockchain requires taking an omnichain approach for developers. However, the number of standardized marketplaces and tools for building cross-chain protocols and faster DApps is limited. Dojima Network offers an omnichain platform that serves as a universal layer and unifies blockchains regardless of their compatibility with EVM \u2014 Ethereum\u2019s smart contract executer Ethereum Virtual Machine. The platform includes a marketplace that supplies developers with a wide range of powerful tools. By reducing the technical barriers to cross-chain building and eliminating the need to create from scratch, Dojima \u2014 a Cointelegraph Accelerator participant \u2014 empowers developers with the ability to build complete applications from templates in just a few minutes. After 15 months of testnet launch and 100,000 hours of development, Dojima recently launched its stagenet \u2014 the alpha version of its mainnet. During this phase, Dojima Network will onboard partner blockchains to allow them to test stagenet functionalities before eventually deploying them on the mainnet. The stagenet processed more than one hundred transactions within the first 24 hours.  Dojima Network has expanded its team since 2021\u2019s \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d Source: Dojima Network The omnichain platform employs a user-centric approach, focusing on attracting a diverse range of developers with its robust marketplace and tools rather than onboarding the same players. The ecosystem is composed of two overlapping chains. The Dojima Chain is the fundamental layer, and it hosts development-related activities, while the Hermes Chain connects the Dojima Chain to external blockchains and enables interaction and liquidity sharing between them. With its comprehensive infrastructure, Dojima Network aims to be more than a bridge and function as a unified layer for blockchains. It strives to redefine standards for asset and data management and utilization, improving blockchain efficiency and simplicity as a result. The Dojima team spent the crypto winter of 2021 expanding its roster and boosting its protocol, announcing partnerships with major venture capital firms. Both testnet and stagenet gained immediate traction, and the stagenet recorded hundreds of thousands of transaction volume on its first active day. The cross-chain platform now concentrates on carrying out audits of its stagenet and getting ready for the mainnet launch. Dojima\u2019s roadmap also includes the release of a token, with more details coming soon. \u201cAt Dojima Network, we\u2019re not just embracing change, we\u2019re driving it,\u201d Dojima Network founder Akhil Reddy commented, adding: \u201cOur commitment to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in omnichain, AI automation, zero knowledge and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is paving the way for a future where blockchain technology truly transforms the world we live in.\u201d Emerging as a financial solution, blockchain technology is now embraced in many industries, with use cases ever expanding. Blockchains are the backbone of the Web3 revolution, and interoperability is required to fulfill the promise of Web3. Omnichain solutions like Dojima Network provide communication between networks \u2014 something blockchains can not accomplish natively. With this approach, Dojima contributes to the goal of creating unified blockchains and a digitally interconnected world.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Ethereum, #Adoption, #Developers, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Mar 28, 2024","summary":"","author":"Tristan Greene","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/web3-nft-metaverse-game-wilder-world-gets-epic-game-store-listing","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Web3 game Wilder World gets Epic Game Store listing during alpha testing","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Web3 game Wilder World has been given a listing on the Epic Games Store ahead of its as-of-yet unscheduled launch.

As told by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri during FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) sentencing on March 28, not all customers have been made whole by the exchange's bankruptcy. \u201cSullivan & Cromwell [FTX bankruptcy counsel] has trampled over our property rights,\u201d Kavuri alleged. \u201cThey have liquidated billions of dollars of crypto assets. There\u2019s a token S&C sold at 11 cents; it\u2019s now trading at two dollars. FTX had $10 billion [misprint] in Solana tokens \u2014 they sold it at 70% discount.\" In an earlier victim impact statement filed by Kavuri, the FTX creditor claimed that the FTX estate \u201cowns 41.1 million Solana tokens which should be distributed to FTX creditors. They were planning to sell them for $60, the price today is $187.\" Despite the creditors\u2019 claims, presiding Judge Lewis A. Kaplan reiterated that the March 28 hearing was solely for sentencing SBF, and not for raising issues with creditors\u2019 claims. \u201cI accept your assertion the claim customers will be made whole is inaccurate,\" said Judge Kaplan. At least one investor seems to have confirmed the discounted sales. On March 27, Canadian blockchain firm Neptune Digital Assets announced it had acquired 26,964 SOL at $64 per token, a 67% discount to its then-market price. Although the firm did not specify its counterparty, the terms of the sale match the offer conditions provided by the FTX estate. As per a March 7 Bloomberg report, the vesting period for the purchase of discounted SOL tokens is four years. Simultaneous to the bankruptcy proceedings, FTX creditors have filed a class action against Sullivan and Cromwell, alleging that the firm participated in the FTX fraud before it became the exchange's bankruptcy counsel. Before its collapse, FTX was an early investor in the Solana ecosystem.

To put this into context, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price fell by 18% during the same period, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped by 16%. A number of market and technical indicators show that ETH may witness a deeper correction before embarking on a sustained recovery. Ether is up 8% so far in March but has underperformed Bitcoin as well as other top layer 1 tokens. BTC price has rallied 21% over the last 30 days, while other top-cap layer 1 tokens, such as BNB Chain\u2019s BNB and Solana\u2019s SOL, have rallied 44% and 76%, respectively, over the same timeframe. The ETH/BTC ratio declined throughout March, reaching its lowest since January. Currently, there are a handful of reasons for ETH\u2019s underperformance in March, including Bitcoin-specific factors in 2024. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have largely been a success since their approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 11. In addition, the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving, which has historically preceded a parabolic uptrend in crypto prices, has added to BTC\u2019s tailwinds. Moreover, there has been a decline in Ethereum\u2019s network activity (in specific metrics) over the last week. Data from Glassnode shows that daily active addresses on Ethereum have dropped from 622,963 addresses on March 20 to 546,484 on March 26. Although Ethereum remains the network to beat in the layer 1 sector, Solana has recently captured its market share in this segment in terms of on-chain activity and stablecoin transfer volume. Related: Munchables hacker returns $62.8M Ether without ransom Ether\u2019s latest attempt at recovery was rejected by supply congestion from the $3,600 level. This is an indication that this area presents a stubborn barrier in ETH\u2019s recovery path. The significance of this resistance zone is reinforced by data from IntoTheBlock. Its In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model reveals that this area is within the $3,534 and $3,639 price range, where roughly 1.17 million addresses previously bought approximately 4.97 million ETH. If this resistance level sees a high volume of activity from the sellers in the short term, Ether\u2019s price is expected to sink deeper. After reaching a 27-month high of $4,093 on March 12, ETH price pulled back as bears booked profits and the wider crypto market corrected. The price has since recovered to the current price of $3,511 Despite the recovery, a bear flag can be seen on the daily chart, which hints at the continuation of the downtrend. Ether bulls are counting on support from the flag\u2019s lower boundary at $3,497. A daily candlestick close below this level would signal a bearish breakout from the chart formation, projecting a decline to $3,060. Such a move would represent a 26% descent from the current price. The relative strength index\u2019s (RSI) position around 50 also indicated that the bears were selling on the latest rally to $3,600.

The three protocols are united by the common goal of developing blockchain-based decentralized AI protocols, which can't be controlled by centralized parties or large stakeholders. The high-level merger is a testament to the benefits of decentralized AI over its centralized counterparties, according to ChainGPT\u2019s Rakhmanov: \u201cAI is frequently becoming second nature to users in their personal, professional, and private lives.

On March 28, Judge Lewis Kaplan of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sentenced Bankman-Fried to 240 months and 60 months for a total of 25 years for his conviction on seven felony charges. SBF was the first person tied to FTX and Alameda Research to face prison time following the collapse of the exchange in November 2022. Judge Kaplan found that SBF also committed witness tampering based on the events that led him to revoke bail in August 2023 and perjury based on his testimony at trial over FTX user funds. He acknowledged Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201csocial awkwardness\u201d but said, based on former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison\u2019s testimony, SBF knew he was at fault but was \u201cnot going to admit a thing.\u201d \u201cPunishment must fit the seriousness of the crime,\u201d said Judge Kaplan. \u201cAnd this. Was. A. Serious. Crime [...] When not lying, [Bankman-Fried] was evasive, hair splitting, trying to get the prosecutors to rephrase questions for him. I\u2019ve been doing this job for close for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen a performance like that.\u201d A March 28 docket entry for the Southern District of New York suggested the judge would deduct SBF\u2019s time already served from his sentence, meaning 291 months in prison. Judge Kaplan also suggested an $11-billion judgment in addition to SBF\u2019s prison time. He said FTX investors lost $1.7 billion, lenders lost $1.3 billion, and customers lost $8 billion. According to Inner City Press reporter Matthew Lee, the New York courtroom was packed with members of the public and officials before the U.S. Marshals brought out Bankman-Fried. The former FTX CEO was reportedly wearing light brown clothes \u2014 the uniform of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he has stayed since the judge revoked his bail. \u201cI reject the defense\u2019s argument about loss, both on the law and on the facts,\u201d said Judge Kaplan, according to Inner City Press. \u201cThe assertion that customers and creditors will be paid in full is misleading \u2014 defendants equate loss with dollar volume in the bankruptcy case.\u201d The judge added: \u201cA fortuitous run-up in the value of some cryptocurrencies bears no relation to the gravity of the crimes that were committed. A thief who takes his loot to Las Vegas and successfully bets is not entitled to a sentencing reduction.\u201d Before the judge announced the sentence, Bankman-Fried said he was \u201csorry about what happened at every stage,\u201d claiming that \u201cFTX would have survived\u201d if it hadn't been shut down. In a final statement, his attorneys seemingly portrayed the former FTX CEO as a misunderstood genius: \u201cSam was not a ruthless financial serial killer. He wasn\u2019t predatory. He makes decisions with math in his head, not malice in his heart.\u201d Sunil Kavuri, a U.K. national who flew in from London for the sentencing hearing, testified that he had \u201csuffered for two years\u201d after the collapse of FTX. Kavuri addressed the court on behalf of other FTX victims, pushing back against the narrative that the \u201closs was zero\u201d based on the exchange\u2019s plans for repayment. \u201cIf Mr. Bankman-Fried thought mathematics justified it, he\u2019d do it again,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos. He added there was \u201cno acceptance of responsibility\u201d from the former CEO. Related: Which crypto figures might be going to prison in 2024? Judge Kaplan\u2019s sentence essentially split the difference between recommendations from SBF\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors, who argued for a maximum of 6.5 and 50 years, respectively. Many experts predicted Judge Kaplan would impose a sentence of between 10 to 30 years based on the facts of the case and the amount of funds involved. Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame \u2014 four other individuals associated with FTX and Alameda charged in the same case as SBF \u2014 have pleaded guilty and accepted deals.

Knight","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/crypto-adoption-charity-donation","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Over half of U.S. charities now accept cryptocurrency donations","type":"Blog","category":"Analysis","content":"Cryptocurrency adoption in the charity space is growing quickly, with 56% of the top 100 charities in the United States now accepting crypto donations as of January 2024, according to the 2024 annual report from crypto charity organization The Giving Block. This marks a huge turnaround for nonprofits, many of which were initially hesitant to adopt crypto payments. As the report states, \u201cWhen we launched The Giving Block in 2018, we had to practically bust down doors to get nonprofits to talk to us about bitcoin.\u201d The report adds, \u201cA lot has changed since then.\u201d Cointelegraph spoke with the Giving Block co-founder Alex Wilson to discover how attitudes are shifting and whether he expects to see charitable organizations trend toward greater crypto adoption in the future. \u201cYes, over time, we continue to see greater adoption of nonprofits accepting cryptocurrency donations,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cThe market has become too big to ignore. There aren\u2019t many markets in the world that allow a nonprofit to tap into a $2 trillion donor base.\u201d Wilson believes knowledge and familiarity with cryptocurrency are key to this change. \u201cMost of it is a matter of education. Many nonprofits just don\u2019t realize how many people own cryptocurrency. Yet once they realize that, they come around to it pretty quickly,\u201d he said. To onboard as many charities as possible, the Giving Block aims to make it simple for charities to accept crypto donations. Part of that comes in the form of an auto-sell feature, which transfers crypto into dollars at the point of donation. \u201cIf they\u2019d like, they can opt to hodl, but most are more comfortable liquidating the donations, similar to how they treat other non-cash donations like stock or other forms of property. Our goal is to make taking crypto just as easy as taking any other gift a nonprofit gets,\u201d said Wilson. With this in mind, using a donation solution minimizes a nonprofit\u2019s exposure to cryptocurrency. Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s \u201cThe main pitfall is trying to do too much without knowing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cSome nonprofits have opted to take things on themselves rather than work with a trusted partner.\u201d According to Wilson, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t usually end well\u201d for those who try to go it alone. Save the Children, a nonprofit focused on improving the lives of children worldwide, began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines. Ettore Rossetti, head adviser for technology, marketing and innovation partnerships at Save the Children, told Cointelegraph that the path to accepting crypto donations wasn\u2019t wholly straightforward, requiring several sign-offs from various departments before the initiative could move forward. \u201cI secured the proper legal, financial and media communications permissions to be able to accept that Bitcoin donation,\u201d said Rossetti, who admitted \u201cthere were concerns\u201d centered around matters such as environmental impact. Even with those concerns, Rossetti managed to secure all necessary approvals within 24 hours, proving that where the will exists, progress can be very swift indeed. Having used various trusted partners from 2013 onward, Save The Children is now one of the many nonprofits working with The Giving Block. Many of its programs have benefited from the generosity of crypto donors. For example, in Afghanistan, crypto donors helped support humanitarian assistance for 730,000 children in the chaotic aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal. Following the 2023 earthquake in Syria and Turkey, crypto donations helped fund Save the Children\u2019s water and sanitation program, reaching 1.1 million children and 2.6 million people in total. In Uganda, in cooperation with World of Women, Save the Children raised $100,000 \u2014 helping to meet the educational needs of 115,000 children and adolescents. Although crypto and charitable giving are becoming increasingly close-knit, there are still challenges ahead. The mainstream media isn\u2019t always kind to the blockchain industry, and nonprofits must remain mindful of their reputation. Then there are figures such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who associate the crypto industry with illicit activity. We asked Wilson what impact figures like Warren have on the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating since Elizabeth Warren and other politicians have often used exaggerated or outright false data to support their claims,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cLuckily, the facts support us, and the evidence is clear that there is much less illicit activity than people like Elizabeth Warren claim. All the data points to there being less illicit activity in crypto than there is in the traditional economy.\u201d Rossetti said that one thing Save the Children had to actively consider was the environment and \u201cthe reputational risk associated with issues such as energy utilization, especially proof-of-work chains like the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d Recent: Bitcoin halving hype: How retail investors can prepare For Rossetti and Save the Children, the environment is something they are continually mindful of since climate change \u201cexacerbates the problems facing children \u2014 more natural disasters and so on.\u201d \u201cWe are the world\u2019s first nonprofit to be part of the Green Climate Fund and the only children\u2019s charity. So, we\u2019re proud of that. We only have one planet,\u201d said Rossetti. \u201cBut in looking at it more closely, just beyond headlines, many of the blockchains are powered by renewable sources or underutilized energy. And therefore, that essentially tends to be overblown.\u201d Save the Children\u2019s latest drive for crypto samaritans is #HODLhope. As the campaign states, \u201cAround the world children are being robbed of their futures by a global economy built on inequality and greed. [...] Save the Children believes that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies can be a force for good and a force for financial inclusion.\u201d The aim of #HODLhope is to raise $10 million in crypto donations by the end of 2024, allowing children around the world to hold on to hope. Having raised nearly $8 million by March, the campaign looks sure to attain that. For the 44% of the top 100 U.S. charities that have yet to awaken to the power of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally, now may be the time to take note.","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #Charity, #Business, #Investments, #Adoption, #Philanthropy"},{"date":"Mar 28, 2024","summary":"","author":"Cointelegraph Accelerator","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/real-world-data-for-blockchain-apps-gora-joins-cointelegraph-accelerator","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Real-world data for blockchain apps: Gora joins Cointelegraph Accelerator","type":"Blog","category":"CT Accelerator","content":"Gora, a decentralized blockchain oracle network, joins the ranks of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program.

According to a March 28 White House memorandum, federal agencies must, within 60 days, appoint a chief AI officer, disclose AI usage and integrate protective measures. This directive aligns with United States President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on AI from October 2023. On a teleconference with reporters, Vice President Kamala Harris said: \u201cI believe that all leaders from governments, civil society and the private sector have a moral, ethical and societal duty to make sure that artificial intelligence is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm while ensuring everyone can enjoy its full benefits.\u201d The latest regulation, an initiative by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), aims to guide the entire federal government in safely and efficiently utilizing artificial intelligence amid its rapid expansion. While the government seeks to harness AI\u2019s potential, the Biden administration remains cautious of its evolving risks. As stated in the memo, certain AI use cases, particularly those within the Department of Defense, will not be mandated for disclosure in the inventory, as their sharing would contradict existing laws and government-wide policies. By Dec. 1, agencies must establish specific safeguards for AI applications that could affect the rights or safety of Americans. For instance, travelers should have the option to opt out of facial recognition technology used by the Transportation Security Administration at airports. Related: Biden administration announces key AI actions after executive order Agencies unable to implement these safeguards must discontinue using the AI system unless agency leadership can justify how doing otherwise would heighten risks to safety or rights or hinder critical agency operations.

The episode also covers data sovereignty and the importance of privacy in the ever-evolving internet landscape. The conversation between Owusu Akyaw and Trouw explores new issues like elections and fake news, and how blockchain tech could be used to verify the authenticity of information on social media. Trouw explains that the sovereign internet is based on that idea of the original version of the internet (Web1) but with the functionalities of Web2 and Web3. On a sovereign internet, users own their own data set, tools and services, which they can share with other users without needing a central server or third-party authority. \u201cSo the sovereign internet is really, to some degree, a step back from Web2 to Web1, where each party has their own services and their own peer-to-peer functionality that they share with somebody else. And the internet works the way it\u2019s meant to be, where it\u2019s resilient to outages.\u201d With major elections taking place worldwide in 2024, issues like fake news and artificial intelligence-generated deep fakes threaten to widen the polarization in society. Trouw concedes that blockchain may not be the answer to the problem since dealing with fake information on the internet requires the average person to be a skeptic and have the desire to verify everything they read. However, when society develops a culture that seeks to verify the credibility of information, Trouw believes that blockchain technology would be the ultimate method to authenticate the origin of information on the internet.

According to documents submitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the assets are allegedly the proceeds of criminal activities linked to Michael Patryn, co-founder of Quadriga Coin Exchange, and Gerald Cotten.

On March 28, the Dune Analytics dashboard created by Hildobby to track Ethereum staking progress showed that the network achieved a validator count of one million, with the 32 million ETH staked accounting for 26% of the total supply. The data also showed that around 30% of the ETH is staked using the Ethereum staking pool Lido, a liquid staking platform for proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. Staking pools like Lido remain popular because they allow users with a smaller amount of ETH to pool their assets and participate. Validators ensure the security of a blockchain by monitoring the network for any malicious transactions, such as double-spending, which is essentially spending the same currencies twice. In Ethereum, validators participate in proposing and validating transactions within the network. Those who wish to participate in this process are required to stake 32 ETH. In return, they get a small portion of ETH as a reward. While the number of validators could translate into higher security for a blockchain, some community members think too many validators could pose a problem. Venture investor and Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness said there\u2019s arguably already \u201ctoo much\u201d staked. Gabriel Weide, who runs a staking pool, believes that too many validators can eventually lead to \u201cfailed transactions.\u201d Meanwhile, Peter Kim, the head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, said that while the number of validators is \u201cimpressive,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cartificially inflated by the 32 ETH cap.\u201d However, he suggested this may change soon.

Last September, Amazon announced its investment intentions and made an initial investment of $1.25 billion. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI. It has created its own AI chatbot, rivaling ChatGPT, called Claude. In early March, Anthropic released its most powerful version, Claude 3, which can also analyze images.

Last October, Google announced a $500-million investment in the company with a commitment to increase to $2 billion. Anthropic, like all the major AI chatbot developers, has found itself involved in legal battles over copyright and data infringement.

Buterin posted his thoughts on March 27 regarding supporting decentralized staking \u201cthrough more anti-correlation incentives\u201d to the Ethereum Research forum. He suggested if multiple validators controlled by the same actor fail together, they would receive a higher penalty than if they failed independently. \u201cThe theory is that if you are a single large actor, any mistakes that you make would be more likely to be replicated across all \u2018identities\u2019 that you control,\u201d he said. Buterin observed that validators within the same cluster, such as a staking pool, are more likely to experience correlated failures \u2014 likely due to shared infrastructure. The proposal suggests penalizing validators proportionally to the deviation from the average failure rate. If many validators fail in a given slot, the penalty for each failure would be higher. Simulations suggest this approach could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller ones, as large entities are more likely to cause spikes in the failure rate due to correlated failures. Potential benefits to the proposal include incentivizing decentralization by having a separate infrastructure for each validator and making solo staking more economically competitive relative to staking pools. Buterin proposed other options, such as different penalty schemes to minimize the average big validator\u2019s advantage over little validators and examining the impact on geographic and client decentralization. He didn\u2019t mention the possibility of reducing the solo staking amount from 32 Ether (ETH), which currently equates to roughly $111,500.

In a series of follow-up comments and posts, a debate between Bitcoin maximalists broke out over THORChain\u2019s security and potential pitfalls for Bitcoiners looking to take out interest-free loans against their BTC using the platform. In a March 27 post to X, mathematician and Bitcoin investor Fred Krueger said he was \u201cwilling to take the heat\u201d for declaring THORChain to be \u201creal\u201d \u2014 which is essentially saying that BTC-backed loans on the protocol were a safe bet for Bitcoiners looking to gain more in the way of liquid funds.

On March 10, analyst Chris Blec described THORChain\u2019s no-liquidation lending model as \u201cinteresting,\u201d however he noted two major catches with the concept. The first was that investors take the risk more obvious risk of lending their Bitcoin to a protocol that could otherwise collapse or fall victim to an exploit \u2014 which THORChain already did in 2021, although the funds were returned. The second was that investors are relying upon a centralized provider not to change its terms and conditions at a later date, exposing their loans to risk.

The judge also determined the SEC failed to allege that Coinbase conducted brokerage activity through Coinbase Wallet, its self-custody crypto wallet app that gives users full control of their assets. \u201c[This] is a pretty giant win for browser-based wallet extensions, application front ends, and other similar applications,\u201d said Ethena Labs general counsel Zach Rosenberg in a March 27 X post. \u201c[It\u2019s] not just that Coinbase won, but the basis for it,\u201d Rosenberg emphasized. He explained that Coinbase helping Wallet users find token prices doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acting as a broker by \u201crouting or making recommendations.\u201d Coinbase winning on this issue at this stage means the Court did not think that, even accepting all well-pled SEC allegations as categorically true, there was a plausible basis to conclude that Coinbase acted as a broker by virtue of offering Coinbase Wallet. \u2014 Meat (,) (@MeatEsq) March 27, 2024 The court order could be used by DeFi app developers facing similar lawsuits to argue their way out of allegations that they acted as unregistered brokers. Industry advocate body the Blockchain Association legal head Marisa Tashman Coppel posted she was \u201cvery pleased to see the court curb massive SEC overreach with regard to the Coinbase Wallet allegations.\u201d Law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher partner Mike Selig said in an X post the Coinbase Wallet dismissal was a \u201csignificant setback\u201d for the SEC. \u201cSEC aimed to discourage builders from developing peer-to-peer software. Didn\u2019t work.\u201d Crypto venture firm Variant legal chief Jake Chervinsky said, however, that while there are \u201csome positives\u201d in the judge\u2019s order, \u201coverall, SEC wins.\u201d Related: US lawmakers demand SEC clarify position on Prometheum\u2019s plans for Ether \u201cIt\u2019s great for DeFi that Wallet is not a broker, and there\u2019s good language on other issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the court sided with the SEC (incorrectly, [in my opinion]) on several key issues.\u201d Chervinsky explained Judge Failla said the Howey test \u2014 a legal framework to classify securities \u2014 applies to \u201cpurely secondary market transactions\u201d and ignores the \u201c\u2018contract\u2019 in \u2018investment contract.\u2019\u201d He claimed the court also adopted the SEC\u2019s theory that a token project using sale profits to reinvest into its ecosystem is a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d where buyers would reasonably expect profits \u2014 making it a security. \u201cThis is a disappointing outcome,\u201d Chervinsky said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only the beginning \u2014 not the end \u2014 of the SEC\u2019s case against Coinbase specifically.\u201d The case will now continue into discovery \u2014 where Coinbase and the SEC collect evidence for their arguments.

BlobScriptions were introduced on March 27 by a protocol called Ethscriptions, allowing users to inscribe data \u2014 from JPEGs to text \u2014 directly onto \u201cblobs,\u201d which were introduced to the Ethereum network as part of the network\u2019s Dencun upgrade on March 13. Less than five hours after the introduction of BlobScriptions, the gas fees for Blobs soared as high as 585 gwei \u2014 equivalent to roughly $18, according to data from Ultrasound.money. This was a far cry from the average gas price for minting data on a blob before BlobScriptions, which averaged around one wei, equivalent to a tiny fraction of $0.01. However, Blob fees have since fallen considerably from its newly notched high. At the time of publication, blob fees are running at 35.8 gwei, equivalent to $1.20, per Coinbrain conversion data. Meanwhile, users have made over 4,500 inscriptions on blobs since the introduction of BlobScriptions, according to Dune Analytics data. In a March 27 post to X, Ethscriptions founder Tom Lehman \u2014 who goes by the alias Middlemarch \u2014 noted the spiking cost of \u201cblobspace,\u201d and urged users to mint BlobScriptions via the official blobscription protocol. Much in a similar way to the early days of Bitcoin Ordinals, Ethereum users are opting to mint small pieces of text and seemingly random assortments of images to blobs, with the most recent activity on blobscription.io showing hundreds of new images added in the last few hours. Notably, blob data is only stored on Ethereum nodes for around 18 days meaning that after that period, BlobScriptions data will be removed from the network. However, Lehman added that the Ethscriptions indexer would store the data \u201cindefinitely.\u201d Related: Starknet targets increased throughput, lower fees with parallel transactions in 2024 Blobs were introduced by way of EIP-4844 \u2014 a core data-saving feature of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade \u2014 which was focused primarily on reducing transaction costs on layer-2 networks by a significant margin. Transaction fees on Ethereum L2s fell drastically following the Dencun upgrade, with swap fees on Arbitrum plunging from around $1.25 to below $0.02, while Polygon fees fell by a similar amount. As a way of lauding the decreased fees that came with blobs, one developer Ethereum managed to mint the entire script of the Bee Movie on an Ethereum blob less than 15 minutes after the upgrade went live all for less than $13 in ETH gas fees.

Next month, the Bitcoin halving will reduce daily BTC production by about 450 BTC from the current average daily amount of 900 BTC, investment researcher Lyn Alden told Cointelegraph. However, Alden said the amount of supply cut pales compared to daily fiat flows in and out of crypto exchanges and Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). \u201cIn fact, inflows or outflows can easily exceed 10x of that value,\u201d Alden said, adding that overall demand for Bitcoin is a \u201cbigger factor than tightening supply.\u201d Historically, demand for Bitcoin has been more correlated with measures of global liquidity, such as the global broad money supply, Alden stressed, referring to a chart reflecting the BTC price versus global monetary supply (M2). \u201cSo I think the halving is important, but it\u2019s only one factor out of many that determines the occurrence and timing of a bull market. Various measures of global liquidity, HODL waves, and other catalysts combine to serve a larger role,\u201d Alden said, adding: \u201cI am bullish for the next two years due to a combination of the halving, expectations for improved global liquidity, and the fact that so many coins have rotated to strong hands in the bear market, and so a relatively minor increase in demand can move the price quite a bit.\u201d 10x Research CEO and head analyst Markus Thielen says the current rally is \u201cundoubtedly on par\u201d with the 2020 and 2021 bull market, which initially peaked in April 2021. Referring to tools like quantitative analysis, Thielen has been bullish on the price of Bitcoin after the cryptocurrency crossed its multi-year highs on March 13, 2024. Based on historical price changes and Bitcoin\u2019s recent new highs, 10x Research projected that Bitcoin would reach $77,000 by early April and $99,000 by May 2024. \u201cWhen Bitcoin made a new high at $68,300, we saw a wave of intraday selling, but every attempt to push down prices has been met with relentless buying,\u201d Thielen wrote in an email to Cointelegraph on March 14. The analyst noted that each time Bitcoin made new price breakouts in February 2013, February 2017, and November 2020, the price could grow s much as 189% after 180 days. Eventually, Bitcoin would top after nine to 11 months following the breakouts historically, Thielen noted. Thielen forecasted that between December and February 2025 \u2014 or in nine to 11 months following the March 13 breakout \u2014 Bitcoin could move to an eye-watering $146,000. \u201cAlthough corrections and retracements could occur at any time, traders could use the breakout level \u2014 $68,300 \u2014 as their new line in the sand, where we can argue that above this level, Bitcoin could be materially higher over the next few weeks and months,\u201d the analyst said, adding: \u201cDespite the possibility that Bitcoin could climb to 146,000 this summer, we keep our 125,000 price target for now as we expect this bull market to continue until 2025.\u201d The current Bitcoin rally is the first time Bitcoin has posted a parabolic rise and hit a new all-time high before the block reward halving, eToro crypto analyst Simon Peters emphasized. According to Peters, the main reason for such a breakout is the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States on Jan. 11, 2024. \u201cDemand for Bitcoin is fast outstripping the new supply, and this is something we\u2019ve never really had in previous cycles,\u201d Peters stressed. Before the introduction of ETFs, the demand was previously driven mainly by retail, while the ongoing cycle is going to be \u201cmore institutional,\u201d he added. According to Peters, Bitcoin miners are the only natural sellers, as they have been actively dumping BTC since August 2023. \u201cThis suggests to me that miners have already been selling into the current rally in preparation for the upcoming block reward halving,\u201d the analyst said, adding that all selling is \u201cwell bid\u201d because of the high demand from spot ETFs,\" said Peters, adding: \u201cIf we do see a slowdown in spot ETF inflows, this could be an indication of the market topping out and running out of steam, but it\u2019s important to note that whilst the ETFs have been a major contributor to the rally so far, they are not the only participants in the space. Other entities such as MicroStrategy and Bitcoin whales continue to accumulate too.\u201d Meanwhile, Exness financial market strategist Li Xing sees macroeconomic developments driving the Bitcoin price this year. Apart from the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, other economic developments, like expectations of a softer monetary policy and lower interest rates in the U.S. and elsewhere, could boost Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as an alternative store of value, the analyst said. Related: Bitcoin to enter pre-halving \u2019danger zone,\u2019 but crypto CEOs remain bullish \u201cMoreover, geopolitical risks and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. elections could continue to buoy demand, marking the beginning of a sustained bull run in the future,\u201d Li added. Programmed to occur once per 210,000 blocks or roughly every four years, Bitcoin halvings are designed to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s deficit and counteract inflation. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has come through three halving events in 2012, 2016 and 2020, cutting its miner incentive from the initial 50 BTC to the current 6.5 BTC. The soon-to-come Bitcoin halving in 2024 will further decrease the mining reward from 6.5 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with post-halving rallies. For example, Bitcoin skyrocketed about 3,000% in 17 months after halving in 2016, reaching a historic milestone of $20,000 in December 2017.

Lyu did not mention the federal charges, although he alluded to them in the first sentence of his letter: \u201cI would like to express my gratitude to all KuCoin users, for your support, trust and companionship during the past few days.\u201d Comparing the airdrop to the exchange\u2019s reimbursement of its investors who lost money in the Confido rug pull, Lyu continued: \u201cRecently, on March 26th and 27th, some users experienced longer-than-expected wait times during the withdrawal process. [\u2026] To express our profound gratitude for your support and patience KuCoin will launch a special airdrop event totaling 10 million USD in KCS and BTC.\u201d Rules for the airdrop will be released in three days, Lyu wrote. The recent delays in withdrawals were possibly caused by the high volume as wary customers abandoned the exchange. The airdrop thus rewards users who remained loyal to the exchange in its time of crisis. Related: KuCoin agrees to ban New York residents and pay $22 million settlement The timing of the airdrop is noteworthy since KuCoin was hit with a barrage of legal actions one day earlier. The Justice Department unsealed an indictment for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for lacking an Anti-Money Laundering program by the two founders and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Simultaneously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) initiated a civil case against the exchange for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. KuCoin hastened to assure users that their assets were safe after the charges were filed and KCS fell 12% in 24 hours.

The lawsuit, initially filed on Nov. 17, 2023, in San Jose, sought to hold Apple accountable for its perceived monopolistic practices involving the Apple iOS App Store. Per the complaint, Apple allegedly makes it difficult or impossible for competitors to the Apple Pay service to introduce desirable features such as integrating decentralized cryptocurrency payments into existing or new products and services. As such, the complainants allege that Venmo, CashApp, and other existing or new services are unable to introduce features that would lead to competitive pricing and improved functionality for iOS end users. Related: Apple sued for blocking crypto tech for P2P payments Judge Chhabria granted Apple\u2019s motion for dismissal on March 26, 20. According to the case filing, the complaint suffered from \u201cseveral fatal issues.\u201d The filing goes on to state that the plaintiffs failed to establish what antitrust actions took place, nor did they establish why competitors such as Zelle weren\u2019t included in the initial complaint. It also refers to the plaintiff\u2019s suit as \u201cspeculative,\u201d and outlines what the court perceives as a flawed premise. Essentially, the initial complaint alleges that Apple\u2019s terms of service for products such as Venmo and Cash App to appear on the App Store prohibit those companies from including cryptocurrency features in their products. The judge\u2019s ruling cites the relevant rule (Guideline 3.1.5 in the App Store T.O.S.) and dismisses its applicability in the suit. According to the filing: \u201cEven assuming that Guideline 3.1.5 restricts decentralized cryptocurrency transactions (which seems doubtful), it is not clear how companies agreeing to a guideline outlining the Apple Store requirements for apps facilitating cryptocurrency transactions constitutes an unlawful agreement.\u201d Going forward, the plaintiffs have 21 days from the date of the filing to submit amendments to the case that could compel the court to move forward with the lawsuit before the dismissal becomes record. However, the odds may not be in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, given the tenor of the judge\u2019s final remarks in the filing: \u201cThe plaintiffs should not assume that the defects mentioned in this ruling are the only ones in the complaint. Apple\u2019s motion to dismiss has put them on notice of many more potential problems. Indeed, it is difficult to see how amendment could salvage this case.

Judge Lewis Kaplan will hear from prosecutors and SBF\u2019s attorneys in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for one of the last times the former FTX CEO will appear in person as part of his criminal case. The sentencing hearing will likely conclude the matter, which started with the collapse of FTX in November 2022 and continued with Bankman-Fried\u2019s arrest, extradition, trial and conviction. In November 2023, a jury found SBF guilty of charges that included wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. The former CEO\u2019s lawyers were the first to file a sentencing recommendation, suggesting that SBF serve 6.5 years in prison for his actions that led to FTX investors losing access to millions of dollars.

Data from Bitcoin derivatives data reveal a decline in bullish sentiment among professional traders over the past week, which could possibly indicate that the $69,000 level will not hold. Despite a rally from $63,800 to $70,000 in the five days leading up to March 27, only $151 million in leveraged short positions were forcibly closed in the BTC futures markets. This suggests that bears remained cautious, even in light of last week's significant $888 million net withdrawal from U.S. Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a positive note, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience by recovering from a 17.6% drop from $73,757 on March 14 to $60,795 on March 20 without causing panic among spot ETF investors. However, some market observers argue that the primary driver behind BTC reaching a new high before the April Bitcoin halving was the unexpectedly high inflows into spot ETFs, highlighting the importance for bulls to monitor such trends. A positive for Bitcoin enthusiasts, this week saw a reversal in spot ETF flows, with a total of $418 million in net inflows recorded on March 26. Crucially, this was not due to reduced outflows from Grayscale's GBTC, indicating genuine institutional demand even as Bitcoin's price lingered just 4% below its peak. However, this does not assure professional traders that $69,000 will serve as a support level. Analysts can discern whether whales and arbitrage desks are adopting a bullish or bearish stance by analyzing aggregated positions across spot, perpetual, and quarterly futures contracts. On Binance, the long-to-short ratio among professional traders was 1.50, favoring long positions on March 22, a figure that has slightly decreased to 1.42 currently. On OKX, the sentiment was much more bullish on March 22, with a long-to-short ratio of 3.22, a sentiment that has since diminished, with the ratio currently at 1.49 in favor of longs. This indicates a notable reduction in optimism among top traders, despite the 9.5% price increase during the period, suggesting other factors may be dampening bullish sentiment. Some analysts argue that the global economic downturn is impacting Bitcoin's performance, particularly after the S&P 500 index could not maintain its all-time high of 5,320 achieved on March 21. The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions for 2024 is causing investors to lose confidence; rate cuts are generally seen as positive for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, which reflects the expectations of the fixed-income markets, there's only an 8% chance of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's May 1 meeting. Furthermore, analysts caution that a Fed rate cut may signal troubles rather than prosperity. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, shared his concern over the lack of earnings growth posing the greatest risk to the stock market. He also highlighted worries about the overemphasis on artificial intelligence, which has significantly propelled the stock market's recent gains. Related: Massive Bitcoin consolidation sparks sell-side liquidity concerns Data on Bitcoin's top traders indicates a decrease in the preference for leveraged long positions, differing from an increase in bears\u2019 comfort. This shift may stem from simultaneous all-time highs in diverse asset classes, including gold, U.S. stocks, Bitcoin, Japan's Nikkei 225 index, and live cattle, suggesting market anticipation of a weaker U.S. dollar against scarce resources. The diminished interest in leveraged BTC longs should not alarm investors, nor a signal that Bitcoin will trade below $69,000, as it likely reflects broader economic recession concerns and external pressures, such as the U.S. Justice Department's charges against KuCoin exchange on March 26 and the European Parliament's committee discussions on limiting cryptocurrency payments from self-hosted wallets.

Cryptocurrencies have carved a niche that marries the decentralization ethos with the reality of market dynamics. The crypto market beckons the broader populace with the promise of an alternative financial system that is both inclusive and transparent. Despite its potential, the crypto industry grapples with challenges that hinder its mass adoption and utility, such as volatility and trust. The volatility is not just a symptom of speculative trading. It also reflects the nascent state of the underlying technology and the market\u2019s ongoing struggle to find equilibrium amid varying supply and demand pressures. Additionally, the industry faces significant regulatory hurdles. The global patchwork of crypto regulation \u2013 ranging from outright bans to enthusiastic embracement \u2013 displays traditional financial systems\u2019 struggle to reconcile crypto\u2019s decentralized nature with existing frameworks. Compliance with these regulations, particularly those related to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, presents a formidable challenge for crypto projects, necessitating innovative solutions to balance privacy with transparency. Enter Kelp, a cryptocurrency initiative that seeks to establish the next global reserve currency by addressing the challenges plaguing the industry through a unique blend of technology, on-chain data and monetary theory. Kelp distinguishes itself by employing a governance model governed by a monetary policy reminiscent of traditional fiat currencies.  At the heart of Kelp\u2019s proposition is the Kelp Protocol, an algorithm designed to predict what the circulating supply should be in order to stabilize the price of Kelp based on a modified version of the quantity theory of money. Kelp\u2019s approach aims to mitigate the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, making Kelp a more reliable store of value and medium of exchange. The principles of central banking underpin Kelp\u2019s stabilization mechanism within a decentralized framework. The synthesis allows for a stabilized currency that leverages blockchain technology for transparency and security. Allowing users globally to reserve Kelp before its launch, the platform\u2019s Reservation Program democratizes participation in its new currency through simple daily tasks and referrals. Users can complete tasks to earn currency allocations without substantial upfront investments or deep technical knowledge. Traditionally, hedge fund strategies have been the preserve of the wealthy, requiring significant capital and access to complex financial instruments. Kelp aims to break this perception and democratize hedge fund-style trading strategies with Kelp Autonomous Trading Engine, or KATE. By navigating the complex landscape of global crypto regulation, Kelp aims to set a precedent for responsible and sustainable cryptocurrency development. Kelp has plans to maintain user privacy while adhering to KYC and AML guidelines, emphasizing continuous adaptation to regulatory changes.  The path forward for Kelp. Source: Kelp.org This commitment extends to the project\u2019s Token Release Strategy, which carefully regulates the introduction of new tokens into circulation, minimizing inflationary pressures and aligning with its objectives of achieving price stability and a minimum circulating supply. Kelp is in the process of raising a $102 million presale to collateralize the token and support the ecosystem. The fundraising effort will help Kelp ensure liquidity and a stable foundation for the features it\u2019s building. Kelp has currently raised over $270,000 toward this goal of \u201cstable money for all.\u201d Kelp represents a nuanced approach to the challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. By integrating monetary policy with blockchain technology, Kelp aspires to stabilize its currency and set a new standard for digital currencies. Its focus on regulatory compliance, community involvement and innovative stabilization mechanisms positions Kelp as a noteworthy participant in the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency space.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Cryptocurrencies, #Technology, #Adoption, #Digital Currency, #DeFi"},{"date":"Mar 27, 2024","summary":"","author":"Derek Andersen","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/fidelity-files-s-1-application-us-sec-spot-eth-eft-staking","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Fidelity files S-1 application with US SEC for spot ETH EFT with staking","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Fidelity filed an S-1 application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 27 to create a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). As expected from an earlier filing, the ETF will give Fidelity the option to stake part of the ETH it holds. The asset management giant\u2019s ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which affiliated with sponsor FD Funds Management, would serve as custodian of the trust\u2019s ETH. According to the S-1: The Trust [fund] intends to establish a program to stake a portion of the Trust\u2019s assets through one or more staking infrastructure providers. That decision entails additional risk, the application noted. There would be a risk of loss \u201cincluding in the form of \u2018slashing\u2019 penalties\u201d and liquidity risks while the stake is being processed. In addition, staking rewards would be treated as income for the fund for tax purposes, as a result of which investors will experience a taxable event \u201cwithout an associated distribution from the Trust.\u201d The application does not specify the expected fees for the ETF. In case of a fork, the custodian will decide which chain the fund will support. There are multiple other risks associated with the ETF. The form points out that regulatory measures in the United States and elsewhere could negatively impact the fund. Among the potential causes of the termination of the trust, it lists regulatory action such as the SEC determining the fund to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission determining the fund to be a commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act and the determination that the fund is a money service business under the rules of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

It is not easy to determine the onset of crypto bull runs apart from the fact that BTC price has often peaked 8-11 months after Bitcoin supply halving. Grayscale analysts set out in a recent report to outline the key elements of a bull market. These factors were broken down into the precursors and the \u201cfifth inning,\u201d showing where the market currently stands. According to the report, crypto bull markets have previously begun with a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. \u201cThis trend emphasizes Bitcoin\u2019s role as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market,\u201d the report added. Typically, a rally in altcoins is preceded by growth in BTC price as investors \u201cventure into higher-risk, cryptocurrencies in search of greater returns\u201d buoyed by their Bitcoin profits. Grayscale analyst Michael Zhao said, \u201cThis dynamic was observable during the 2021-2022 bull run, a period where Bitcoin\u2019s gains were swiftly followed by a significant uptick in altcoin valuations.\u201d After analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s market value, Grayscale analysts stated that the metric displayed a \u201cfamiliar pattern\u201d where BTC\u2019s increasing dominance paves the way for a rally in altcoins. However, three unique catalysts distinguish this cycle from the previous ones: spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, positive stablecoin inflows and decreasing BTC balance on exchanges. \u201cThe first pivotal difference in this bull market compared to previous ones is the rapid change in positive market dynamics, largely influenced by spot Bitcoin ETF inflows,\u201d noted Grayscale. Since their approval on Jan. 10, capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have consistently surpassed BTC \u201cissuance by a magnitude of more than 3 times as of mid-March, which has put upward pressure on the price,\u201d the report added. Other catalysts of the latest rally in BTC price that saw it breach the previous all-time highs on March 5 were healthy on-chain fundamentals, including the supply of stablecoin on exchanges. The stablecoin supply change chart showed growth in stablecoin liquidity, indicating the availability of more capital for trading, mainly to buy cryptocurrencies. \u201cThis influx of stablecoin capital, as indicated by rising stablecoin reserves on exchanges, typically fuels the momentum of bull markets.\u201d Related: Bitcoin lacks support above $60K, chart shows as BTC price halts gains In addition to an increase in intent to buy, evidenced by increased stablecoin supply, a lack of intent to sell supported by decreasing supply on exchanges is also an important factor backing Bitcoin\u2019s rally. Additional data from Glassnode reveals that the total number of BTC held in known exchange wallets has declined to about 12% of the total supply, \u201cmarking its lowest level in five years.\u201d In addition, Grayscale reported that there was a noticeable decrease in the Bitcoin held on exchanges \u201cwith a reduction of 7% since the local peak of Bitcoin supply in May 2023.\u201d This signals a supply squeeze partly driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs transferring BTC into custodian cold wallets for long-term storage as investors expect price growth in the future. After understanding the factors that have driven Bitcoin\u2019s price thus far, it is important to determine where the market presently stands. Grayscale uses a baseball analogy to say, \u201cWe are currently navigating the \u2018mid-phase\u2019 or the 'fifth inning' of the current bull.\u201d Using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) \u2013 a metric that calculates the percentage profit/loss by dividing the difference between market value and realized value by the market cap, Grayscale analysts state that the NUPL ratio rose with the increase in BTC\u2019s price. This means as the price grew, investors who bought the asset at lower prices \u201cstill hang on to their coins.\u201d \u201cAs of mid-March 2024, with a NUPL at approximately 60% and historical peaks occurring at profit ratios above 70%, it appears we may be approaching a cycle high on this measure.\u201d Bull markets are particularly driven by euphoria, fear of missing out (FOMO) and speculative trading from retail investors. One of the ways to determine this is by analyzing retail market sentiment. Grayscale analysts looked into data from Satiment, which revealed that retail investor interest is still substantially lower than the levels witnessed during the 2021 bull market. Moreover, data from Google Trends reveals that search interest levels for the word \u201ccrypto\u201d are below 40, significantly lower than the peaks seen in 2021 at 99. This suggests that \u201cthe broader public\u2019s curiosity with cryptocurrency might not have fully rebounded,\u201d says the report. This raises questions as to whether retail investors are participating in the current cycle. \u201cTo reconcile the rising prices/on-chain metrics with the subdued retail sentiment, it's plausible to consider that the retail investors who fueled the previous cycle haven\u2019t fully re-entered the market.\u201d However, data from Alternative, a platform that analyzes \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d around cryptocurrencies, shows that the market sentiments are similar to those seen at the height of the 2021 bull market when BTC hit the previous all-time high of $69,000. This could signal retailers' return to the crypto market, and the associated greed and FOMO are expected to drive prices higher. After considering these technical and fundamental factors, Grayscale concluded that the \u201cbull run will persist.\u201d The firm, however, advised its investors to cautiously monitor flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and other macroeconomic factors for signs of market shifts. Zhao says, \u201cWhile progress has been made, we believe there is still room left to run.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The round was led by Generative Ventures and Borderless Capital, with participation from Spartan Group, HV Capital, CMCC Global, Animoca Brands, Moonrock Capital, Fundamental Labs, and other investors. Behind the peaq network is the Berlin-based startup EoT Labs, founded in 2017 by Leonard Dorl√∂chter, Max Thake, and Till Wendler. The peaq blockchain applies decentralization to physical infrastructure and systems, aiming to build an \u201cEconomy of Things\u201d network. According to the company, its ecosystem is home to more than 20 DePIN projects \u2014 \u201calready more than the likes of Solana, Polygon and other prominent layer-1s,\u201d the company claimed in a statement to Cointelegraph.

Initiatives in different industries are exploring DePIN use cases, such as energy systems for peer-to-peer energy trading, supply chains, telecommunications for internet access, and data storage for secure data management. Data from intelligence firm Messari indicates that the DePIN market valuation could reach $3.5 trillion in the next four years. The startup offers DePINs with Modular DePIN Functions, which are ready-to-use functions that allow DePINs to build and deploy their projects on the blockchain. Features available for projects include a machine tokenization platform and a DePIN Accelerator program. In 2021, peaq raised nearly $2.7 million in a seed round. The additional funds will be primarily allocated to its ecosystem expansion and further development of solutions for developers. \u201cWe will keep working on expanding the ecosystem, which will stand to benefit from more funds going into the Ecosystem Grant Program, and further developing the peaq SDK and the Modular DePIN Functions. All and all, this year is shaping up to be intense, growth-focused, and very promising, which is how we like it,\u201d Leonard Dorlochter, co-founder of peaq, told Cointelegraph.

The inheritance of cryptocurrencies can be a complicated process, even more so if the owner of the digital assets has not made any provisions for their families or designated recipients to take control. Nick Neuman, co-founder and CEO of Casa, tells Cointelegraph that the inheritance of cryptocurrencies has long been an issue for crypto-natives looking to ensure that their digital holdings are passed on accordingly. \u201cIt\u2019s not overlooked. Many people recognize it as a big problem they want to solve but they haven\u2019t had good tools to solve it yet, so most people either don\u2019t have a solution, or have cobbled together something that they hope will work but don\u2019t feel good about,\u201d Neuman said. Casa has offered an inheritance feature to its highest membership tier in the U.S. for the past few years. Neuman said the new offering will be available to all Casa members and differs from the existing high-tier feature, allowing users to transfer Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) holdings to benefactors. Related: Casa Releases Self-Custody Bitcoin Wallet Focused on Privacy The offering aims to ensure that the process of managing cryptocurrency holdings of deceased individuals is straightforward, secure and resistant to malicious actors. Neuman said that instances where inheritance plans have not been made have been \u201cprecarious and stressful,\u201d adding: \u201cWhen we\u2019ve tried to help recover assets for people who don\u2019t have an inheritance plan and have passed away, it has taken anywhere from 6-12 months to figure everything out. Even then, the chance of actually recovering the assets is low.\u201d The offering hinges on a Casa\u2019s user designating a recipient to a specific token vault in its proprietary app. The recipient then creates a free Casa account and scans a QR code provided by the vault owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner\u2019s mobile key. Related: Casa launches multisignature Ethereum self-custody vault The key can only be imported by the specified account and the recipient can\u2019t initially use it or see the vault balance as Neuman explains: \u201cIf the vault owner passes away, the recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a six month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner.\u201d If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in their app. If the timer runs out after six months, the recipient can use the shared mobile key and request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This will give them 2 out of 3 signatures required to access the asset. Casa will also offer a five-key vault, where one hardware key is shared with the recipient. The small increase in friction for recipients adds increased security and resilience of a five-key vault for larger holdings. Best guess estimates pin the value of lost Bitcoin at around $140 billion, of which misplaced keys are often a cause. Since its inception in 2016, Casa has promoted multisignature self-custody in the crypto industry. Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security. Casa\u2019s service originally catered to Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.

Powered by Phemex, the timeline allows crypto community members to explore and look back at the important events that shaped the industry into what it is today. This article explores the pivotal period from 2013 to 2015 in the cryptocurrency world \u2014 a time of significant advancements and notable challenges. During this period, the increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) marked a critical shift toward recognizing digital currencies. However, this era also witnessed the dramatic fall of Mt. Gox, underscoring the risks and volatility in the burgeoning crypto market. This epoch also saw the emergence of the first memecoin and the first nonfungible token (NFT), innovations that expanded the crypto landscape\u2019s creativity and functionality. Explore the History of Crypto Most importantly, this is the time period when the Ethereum network was conceived. This groundbreaking development promised to leverage blockchain technology for more than just currency, paving the way for smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). This period was crucial in shaping the trajectory of the cryptocurrency movement, setting the foundation for future innovations and challenges. Shortly after the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, BTC reached a notable milestone a few months later. On March 28, 2013, the price of Bitcoin climbed, beginning to trade at around $92. This price increase led its market capitalization to hit the $1 billion mark for the first time, marking a significant moment in the cryptocurrency\u2019s history. In an event that sparked widespread attention, Bitcoin achieved a remarkable milestone by reaching a new all-time high of $190 on April 10, 2013, during the Cyprus banking crisis. This crisis highlighted the potential benefits of decentralized currencies, leading many to view Bitcoin as a viable alternative to the traditional financial system\u2019s vulnerabilities. Despite the initial surge, Bitcoin\u2019s value experienced a significant drop to $68 just a week after reaching its peak. Later in the year, Bitcoin continued to captivate market observers by surpassing expectations and reaching $1,000 on Nov. 19, first on the BTC China exchange (now known as BTCC) and subsequently on Mt. Gox. This achievement underscored Bitcoin\u2019s growing relevance and the increasing interest in its role as an alternative asset within the broader financial landscape. During this critical period, Mt. Gox, the largest crypto exchange at the time, faced significant challenges. On June 20, 2013, it announced a temporary halt of U.S. dollar withdrawals, setting off two weeks of uncertainty. Although withdrawals eventually resumed, the exchange encountered difficulties processing them efficiently, underscoring the operational hurdles it grappled with. In a significant development within the cryptocurrency community, Mt. Gox announced the suspension of U.S. dollar withdrawals, followed by a stop to Bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7, 2014. This series of events culminated in the suspension of trading on Feb. 24, 2014, and a bankruptcy filing in Tokyo shortly after. The situation escalated when Mt. Gox sought bankruptcy protection in the United States in March 2014, revealing that 750,000 BTC belonging to its customers and 100,000 of its own coins had been compromised, amounting to a loss valued at around $473 million at that time. While the downfall of Mt. Gox marked a turbulent period in the cryptocurrency sector, it coincided with the emergence of several platforms that would become major players in the future. Okcoin, which would later rebrand to OKX, launched its operations on June 1, 2013. Close on its heels, Kraken\u2019s trading platform became operational on Sept. 10, 2013. In the meantime, Coinbase, established in 2012, secured a $25 million Series B funding round in December 2013, led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, showcasing the growth and resilience of new entrants in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape during a period of upheaval. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin introduced the Ethereum network through a white paper, positioning it as a versatile platform for developing DApps. Buterin outlined how blockchain technology could serve purposes beyond just monetary transactions. In January 2014, Ethereum co-founders Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson and Anthony Di Iorio unveiled Ethereum at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami with Buterin. These exchanges now offer users access to a broad array of cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum\u2019s native coin, Ether (ETH), securing its position as the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization. Ethereum has fulfilled its promise by evolving into a central platform for DApps.

The new Toncoin Staking ETP is a 100% physically backed product that tracks the performance of TON while reinvesting staking yields into the ETP for enhanced performance. The product will start trading on the Swiss SIX Exchange under the ticker TONN on March 27, the firm said in an announcement to Cointelegraph on Wednesday. The new crypto investment product aims to provide investors with an opportunity to earn TON staking rewards without the need to set up and manage a staking node. The TON Blockchain uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) model to achieve network consensus, allowing validators \u2014 or network security supporters \u2014 to earn rewards by staking. According to the TON Foundation, users typically need at least 600,000 TON ($2.9 million) to qualify for staking, but users are allowed to join forces and pool their assets together. With 21Shares, investors will be able to enjoy the benefits of staking Toncoin without the technical complexities associated with TON staking. Instead, they will have the convenience and liquidity of traditional financial markets, the announcement notes. According to 21Shares co-founder and president Ophelia Snyder, TONN is the \u201cfirst and only TON ETP\u201d ever launched. Snyder told Cointelegraph that the firm opted to launch a staking ETP instead of a spot one because staking ETPs are \u201csuperior to non-staking ETPs as the staking yield benefits ETP holders.\u201d She added: \u201cA non-staking ETP would forego their income stream which is paid in TON, so for investors thinking in USD terms, their USD on yield cost goes up if TON goes up.\u201d According to the 21Shares website, the Toncoin Staking ETP holds $25 million at launch, equivalent to roughly 5 million TON at the time of writing. The ETP\u2019s net asset value debuts at $20. 21Shares mentioned that the TONN ETP provides a regulated and secure way for investors to tap into The Open Network, a blockchain network used by popular crypto-friendly messengers like Telegram. Related: TON blockchain launches $115M community incentive program \u201cThe Open Network aims to create a comprehensive ecosystem of user-facing services like the super-app WeChat, offering products like a decentralized storage, decentralized VPN, a payments solution and a native wallet to hold crypto directly within the messaging app,\u201d 21Shares announcement noted. The Open Network, or TON, started as \u201cTelegram Open Network\u201d in 2019 and was developed by Pavel Durov\u2019s Telegram. The company was forced to cut involvement in the blockchain project in May 2020 following a long-running legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite dropping TON formally, Telegram continued actively participating in promoting the open-sourced TON technology and Toncoin. TON is one of the few coins natively supported in the custodial cryptocurrency wallet on Telegram, known simply as \u201cWallet.\u201d In line with the ongoing rally on cryptocurrency markets, TON has posted significant growth recently, surging 134% over the past 30 days. At the time of writing, the coin is trading at $4.97, down about 4.5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

The anticipation around the upgrade was due to Dencun\u2019s aim of reducing transaction fees on L2 blockchain networks and increasing Ethereum\u2019s scalability. High transaction costs associated with Ethereum are some of the biggest challenges for mainstream user adoption, for whom even a few cents matter, Ngo said. \u201cThe mainstream users are used to free messaging and free internet.

Still, Litecoin is underperforming the broader crypto market on a year-to-date (YTD) timeframe, as shown below. Let's discuss the primary reasons behind Litecoin's price rally today.

Notably, on March 5, the Litecoin market witnessed the return of over 600,000 LTC tokens \u2014 worth more than $60 million \u2014 into circulation after being untouched for at least 5 years, the highest daily jump on record, according to Glassnode data.

Today's price rally is part of the same rebound. Interestingly, the absorption of revived LTC tokens is similar to what transpired ahead of the cryptocurrency's 2017 bull run. On Dec. 1, 2017, LTC's price started correcting after the revival around 150,100 LTC tokens (~$150 million), the second highest on record as of March 27, 2024. The cryptocurrency rebounded by over 400% afterward to reach the record high of $420. From the fractal analysis perspective, LTC may be poised for a comparable price surge in the near term. LTC's price rally takes further cues from the potential launch of Coinbase's cash-settled Litecoin futures contracts in April. On March 7, Coinbase Derivatives filed an application with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with a targeted launch date for Litecoin \u2014 as well as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) \u2014 futures contracts starting April 1. A cash-settled Litecoin futures product could attract institutional capital to the LTC market, as the market witnessed after the launch of CME Bitcoin futures in December 2017. That is likely one of the primary reasons behind LTC's recent gains. LTC's recent gains further appear on the heels of Litecoin's booming network health. For instance, Litecoin's hash rate reached a record high of 1.244 Peta-hash per second (PH/s) on March 22 and has been treading around the same level since. That is up 40% so far in 2024, indicating that proof-of-work (PoW) miners have been allocating more computational power for mining and securing the Litecoin blockchain. The increasing hash rate indicates miners' confidence in the profitability of cryptocurrency mining, particularly as Bitcoin approaches its fourth halving in April, set to cut BTC mining rewards by half. In turn, this optimism encourages traders to hold or buy LTC, driving up the price. Related: Bitcoin whale accumulation suggests pre-halving BTC rally will continue For instance, the number of richest Litecoin entities \u2014 those holding at least 100,000 LTC \u2014 have been rising throughout 2024, indicating accumulation in anticipation of a bull run. Litecoin's rally has picked momentum after breaking above its multi-year descending trendline resistance, as shown below. Two key indicators suggest LTC can grow further. First, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains within the neutral range of 30-70 and is on an upward trend. Second, the increase in trading volumes alongside the price ascent signals strong trader support for the upward movement. A case of bullish continuation could see LTC's price rising toward the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement line at around $127.25 \u2014 up 30% from current price levels \u2014 by April. Conversely, a retreat from current price levels could have the price retest the descending trendline resistance at $75.50 as support. The $75.50-support aligns with Litecoin's 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave in the chart above). This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

While some are familiar with popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL), numerous tokens continually emerge in the ecosystem. Those interested in holding cryptocurrencies have two main options: a centralized exchange (CEX) wallet or a private (self-custodial) wallet to store them, and both approaches have pros and cons. This article will explain self-custodial wallets and share basic steps to set up a beginner Trust Wallet to take control of your crypto assets. A centralized exchange (CEX) holds crypto tokens on their client\u2019s behalf. It aligns with a standard Web2 arrangement where users create an account, purchase and sell tokens on the exchange, and rely on the exchange to handle their account and its holdings carefully. CEXs are similar to having a bank or stock brokerage account, but that\u2019s where some of the similarities end. The exchange owns the user\u2019s tokens, and in the case of any unfortunate event like a hack or bankruptcy, users would have no recourse to retrieve these funds. Considering the lack of protection and control over deposits and assets by users, the famous adage \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d exists to encourage direct ownership. Exchange failures are not uncommon; hence, a prudent option is to factor in this reality and avoid large exposure. However, CEXs offer an accessible entry point for those new to cryptocurrencies and can be used to purchase tokens for transfer to other wallets. Users can create an account with one of the reputable exchanges available in the industry. Most CEXs will require Know Your Customer (KYC) checks where users need to provide identification, and upon approval, their account can be set up to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Users must ensure that they turn on additional safety features like two-factor authentication to keep their accounts safe. Blockchains are inherently public, making the tokens owned by any particular wallet address visible to everyone. However, a self-custodial wallet is \u201cprivate\u201d because the user controls the access to these tokens alone. What makes self-custodial wallets unique is that users own the seed phrase or the private key required to perform any transaction with that address. As long as users keep their private key secure, they are the only ones who can control the funds in their wallet, i.e., no third party can control or access those funds. Self-custodial wallets typically begin by generating a unique seed phrase for the user\u2019s wallet, which the user must then securely store in a safe place. This could be on a piece of paper or any other medium. However, users should avoid leaving them as plain scripts on a computer or mobile device, as anyone with access to the seed phrase will have full control over the wallet. A self-custodial wallet can take various forms, including a browser extension wallet (MetaMask), a desktop application (Exodus), a mobile application (Trust Wallet) or a hardware wallet (Ledger). These wallets are usually categorized as hot or cold wallets, depending on their intended use and level of security. The wallets on a user\u2019s browser, desktop or mobile phone are generally considered hot wallets since they stay connected to the internet and are more exposed to potential malicious hacks and security threats, while cold wallets (hardware wallets) are usually offline and only connect to the internet when users need to perform a transaction or interaction. Users highly concerned with security often use cold wallets in a one-way interaction, where coins are transferred into the wallet for storage, but the wallet is never connected to any internet-based application, as a strict rule. Some wallets are moving beyond the usual seed phrase mechanism to bring security and simplicity that could help expand adoption. Some mobile wallets offer features allowing recovery by trusted contacts, focusing on biometric security to safeguard assets. Additionally, certain hardware wallets pair with mobile apps and utilize chip cards for asset protection, emphasizing the need to secure the chip card like a safe key. Moreover, multisignature wallets require multiple approvals for transactions, adding a layer of security against unauthorized access and potential fraud. Trust Wallet supports more than 100 blockchains. Anyone can install a Trust Wallet on their mobile device and have it as a browser extension on their laptop. To get started, users can visit the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and download the mobile application. Users can follow the following simple steps to create a new account: Step 1: Install the app on a mobile device. Step 2: Securely write down a seed phrase during the account set-up stage and keep it secure. This is crucial. If a user loses their seed phrase, they will lose access to their wallet and any funds within it. Step 3: Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup. Once users complete the backup and verification process, they are directed to the main wallet interface, where an initial selection of cryptocurrencies is available for funding. Users can directly fund their Trust Wallet using a credit or debit card through the app, thanks to the integration of several providers that sell cryptocurrencies. If a user has an account with a CEX, they can also transfer cryptocurrencies from the exchange to their Trust Wallet. To fund a crypto wallet using a mobile app, a user must: The above steps typically constitute what is known as the \u201ccrypto on-ramp,\u201d where users can convert their fiat currency into cryptocurrency holdings. One of the key tenets of the Web3 ethos is decentralization and self-custody. Therefore, creating a private self-custody wallet is a practical initial step and opens up users to a wider variety of social and decentralized finance opportunities in the future. The below sections will explain how to transfer crypto assets from Coinbase and MetaMask wallets to Trust wallet. First, download and install Trust Wallet, then the user can proceed to send cryptocurrencies from Coinbase to Trust Wallet by following these steps: Self-custodial wallets have significantly evolved from their early days when users needed technical skills to set them up and had to be very cautious to avoid losing their cryptocurrencies. However, seed phrases are just one aspect of the broader picture. The potential for losing a wallet due to misplaced seed phrases or private keys, coupled with the lack of straightforward methods for transferring wallet ownership to family and friends, remains a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of these wallets by everyday users. Future self-custodial wallets would ideally not rely solely on seed phrases but a combination of biometrics and layers of authentication and approvals to make it easy to onboard more users and provide them with peace of mind and security around the ownership of their digital assets. In terms of privacy, future regulations may require KYC procedures for individual wallet addresses to transact. Therefore, the adoption of self-custodial wallets is primarily aimed at enhancing control over a user\u2019s crypto assets and accessing opportunities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem rather than preserving anonymity on the blockchain.","tags":"#Coinbase, #Cryptocurrencies, #Wallet, #Adoption, #Private Keys, #MetaMask, #Self Custody, #Trust Wallet, #How to"},{"date":"Mar 27, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/ripple-xrpl-defi-integration-amm","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"XRPL blockchain plugs into cross-chain DeFi","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Ripple\u2019s underlying XRPL blockchain is set to unlock a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities following the launch of a natively built automated market maker (AMM) protocol. Ripple recently announced the release of the XLS-30 AMM protocol, built in partnership with the XRPL community, as a feature to benefit its blockchain ecosystem. The AMM is expected to expand the DeFi capabilities of the XRPL ecosystem and enable cross-chain DeFi use cases across 50 blockchains. XRPL\u2019s blockchain ecosystem has an existing decentralized exchange (DEX) featuring a conventional order book, which does not include some of the advanced features that new DeFi protocols have pioneered over the past two years. Related: Ripple CTO seeks community consensus for XRPL AMM feature adoption A spokesperson from Ripple told Cointelegraph that the AMM lays the foundation for further DeFi development on the XRPL blockchain. Integration with cross-chain messaging services like Axelar will broaden the reach and utility of XRPL-based DeFi solutions across several blockchain ecosystems. The AMM has been in development since June 2022, as Ripple chief technology officer and XRPL co-founder David Schwartz reflected on in a recent X post. The AMM aims to complement and expand the existing order book system with XRPL. XRPL\u2019s DEX previously operated solely on order books, providing a capital-efficient trading mechanism for highly liquid pairs. Related: Ripple CTO says \u2018tide is turning\u2019 on US regulatory environment Ripple\u2019s team noted that integrating the AMM with order books complements and expands on the existing DEX-powered ecosystem. \u201cBy integrating the AMM with order books, traders can automatically receive the best price across both systems, while liquidity providers can earn yield on their excess liquidity,\u201d the spokesperson added. The AMM allows developers to enable the creation of liquidity pools for any pair of assets issued on XRPL. Ripple also confirmed that the AMM was not explicitly targeted at institutional trading entities but that its functionality might prove useful for high-volume traders or firms. \u201cWhile the AMM does not currently have built-in compliance features, it complements the existing order book DEX, which may be more suitable for large financial institutions trading popular tokens at high volumes,\u201d the Ripple spokesperson said. Adding the AMM to the existing order DEX is touted to provide a robust trading environment for a range of users, from retail traders to institutions. Cointelegraph also understands that Ripple and XRPL are exploring incorporating on-chain regulatory compliance features in an effort to support institutional uptake of its protocol. The AMM allows developers to enable the creation of liquidity pools for any pair of assets issued on XRPL. Ripple\u2019s team believes that cross-chain messaging protocols will be key in attracting capital, crypto developers and traders from other blockchain ecosystems.

The OTC listing for NILA also shows it has been deemed a \u201cShell Risk\u201d \u2014 a label given to companies it thinks is likely a shell company based on its annual financial data and other income-related metrics. On March 25, Nilam Resources, an investment holding company, announced it had entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire a company that plans to hold 24,800 Bitcoin. Nilam Resources claimed the deal had been months in the making. It plans to issue a newly authorized \u201cpreferred stock\u201d in exchange for the Bitcoin, which will be at a \u201cdiscounted rate relative to current market prices.\u201d A day later, its share prices soared, reaching a new all-time high of 33 cents, up 1,700% from 1.8 cents last week. The company\u2019s current market cap currently stands at $280 million, according to OTCMarkets. However, many crypto-natives aren\u2019t convinced the firm will be able to follow through with its ambitious plan, with some suggesting the announcement is some kind of \u201cmarketing stunt.\u201d Bitcoin analyst and Adamant Research editor Tuur Demeester said he removed his initial tweet sharing Nilam\u2019s announcement on X after \u201ca commenter pointed out that it\u2019s indeed a stunt from a dying penny stock.\u201d Quinten Francois, a crypto YouTuber and co-founder of Web3 company WhereAt Social also accused the filing of being a \u201cmarketing stunt\u201d \u2014 common among failing small-cap stocks.

Led by strong inflows into BlackRock\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s funds, the 10 recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net inflow of $418 million on March 26, according to Farside Investors data. Fidelity\u2019s fund generated its largest daily inflow since March 13, notching $279.1 million on March 26 \u2014 as the investment giant snapped up an additional 4,000 BTC. This marked the second consecutive day the fund has seen inflows exceeding $260 million. Additionally, BlackRock\u2019s fund attracted inflows of $162.2 million. However, its daily inflows remain low compared to inflows earlier this month, which averaged over $300 million per day. Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF fund had its best day since March 12, notching $73.6 million in inflows, while Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton and Valkyrie all saw more than $26 million worth of inflows across their respective funds. Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued to bleed \u2014 notching a daily outflow of $212 million; however, it was not enough to outweigh the net inflows of its competitors. Since converting from a trust to an ETF on Jan. 11, Grayscale has shed a whopping 277,393 BTC worth roughly $19.5 billion at current prices.

Giga co-founder Brent Whitehead described the expansion as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d for his firm in a March 26 post on LinkedIn. \u201cThis move not only broadens our operational landscape but also aligns with our vision to mitigate flaring globally.\u201d Gas flaring is the burning of the natural gas associated with oil extraction. Methane is released as part of the process, which Giga then converts into electricity to power its Bitcoin mining rigs. The expansion will see Giga place a large shipping container with thousands of Bitcoin miners on top of an oil well, divert the excess gas into generators, and then harnessing that energy to power Bitcoin mining rigs, according to a March 26 CNBC report. Giga\u2019s Argentina mining site \u2014 based in the province of Mendoza \u2014 has been in a test phase since December and has already mined between $200,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin, the firm\u2019s other co-founder, Matt Lohstroh, told CNBC. However, the firm is still waiting to import all necessary equipment before it can fully scale the operation. Until then, the firm doesn\u2019t expect to turn a profit. Argentina boasts the second-largest shale gas reserve in the world, according to a recently published academic paper from the University of Michigan. The firm\u2019s Bitcoin mining operation will also reduce methane emissions, Whitehead told CNBC. \u201cBy capturing stranded natural gas to power modular data centers for energy-intensive computing, Giga is actively contributing to reducing global methane emissions.\u201d IT services company Exa Tech will help Giga handle operations onsite, while oil and gas firm Phoenix Global Resources will provide the gas needed to power the Bitcoin miners. Giga first launched its Bitcoin mining operations in 2019 and has 150 megawatts worth of containers installed in its facilities in Texas and Shanghai, according to CNBC.

The wallet address of the exploiter shows that it interacted with the Munchables protocol at 9:26 am UTC, extracting a total of 17,413 ETH, per DeBank data. The exploiter\u2019s wallet address then transferred $10,700 worth of ETH through the Orbiter Bridge, transferring the Blast ETH back into native ETH. At 10:05 pm UTC, the wallet sent an additional 1 ETH to a fresh wallet address. ZachXBT claimed the exploit stemmed from the Munchables team hiring a North Korean developer known by the alias \u201cWerewolves0943.\u201d In a March 27 X post, Solidity developer 0xQuit claimed that the Munchables attack had been planned from the outset, with one of the developers upgrading the Lock contract \u2014 which is meant to lock tokens in for a specified time \u2014 with a new implementation shortly before launch. \u201cThere were appropriate checks to ensure you couldn\u2019t withdraw more than you deposited. But before upgrading, the attacker was able to assign himself a deposited balance of 1,000,000 Ether,\u201d 0xQuit explained. \u201c[The] scammer used manual manipulation of storage slots to assign himself an enormous Ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appears legit.

In letters filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 26, five individuals called on Judge Lewis Kaplan to impose a light sentence on SBF. The letters, from people who knew Bankman-Fried personally or were impacted by the collapse of FTX, highlighted SBF\u2019s vegan lifestyle, his experience dealing with autism, and the exchange\u2019s plan to repay users. Dr. Adam Hesterberg, who lived with SBF from 2012 to 2014, argued the former FTX CEO should receive \u201cleniency in his sentence\u201d based in part on converting half of their household to vegetarianism or veganism. Others who did not know the CEO personally suggested that Judge Kaplan consider Bankman-Fried\u2019s atypical \u201cpersonality traits\u201d in and out of the courtroom. \u201cI can speak from experience that the mind of those on the spectrum works differently,\u201d said Maria Centrella, a mother of a child diagnosed with autism. \u201cThough I have never met Sam, I firmly believe that while he may be an MIT grad - he did not fully understand the scope of what was going on and did not have malicious intent.\u201d Prosecutors submitted a sentence recommendation that Bankman-Fried serve between 40 and 50 years for his role in misusing funds at FTX and Alameda Research. SBF\u2019s lawyers recommended he serve 6.5 years behind bars. The maximum allowable sentence gives Judge Kaplan the discretion to sentence SBF for up to 110 years, but many have suggested that this outcome is unlikely.

Remittance rates are growing faster than the global average in the region, and mobile phone and internet penetration will fuel a transition from cash to digital options, the report said. As of 2022, one in ten people worldwide lives in a home that receives remittances worth a total of $831 billion. The average cost of sending remittances to Latin America was 5.8% of the amount sent, compared to a global average of 6.3%, and costs reaching up to 25.5% at times, usually in the poorest regions, Mastercard reported. Competition is increasing, however, sometimes creating a race to the bottom on prices. The report also cited World Bank data that showed that at least half of remittances were transmitted by informal means. The report identifies a number of current remittance options that together \u201cspeak to the emergence of a completely new reality in global remittances.\u201d Latin America currently receives 43% of its remittances digitally, compared to a world average of 52%.

Despite this, investors remain hopeful, citing the surge in activities such as memecoins and airdrops on the Solana network as key factors that could maintain SOL\u2019s positive trajectory and potentially elevate its price above $200. In a broader context, the cryptocurrency market faces potential vulnerabilities, particularly after Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold above the $71,000 mark on March 26. This failure is seen as an indicator of dwindling investor confidence, especially concerning the outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Should institutional investors further reduce their stakes in listed crypto assets, the outlook for SOL and other alternative coins could darken. Further pressure on SOL\u2019s valuation could stem from recent legal actions by the U.S. Justice Department, which has brought criminal charges against KuCoin exchange and two of its founders. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has accused KuCoin of offering unregulated and unlicensed derivatives contracts to U.S. clientele. Prosecutors maintain that the exchange facilitated transactions involving over $5 billion in \u201csuspicious and criminal proceeds.\u201d Overlooking the short-term implications of Bitcoin's spot ETF flows and regulatory uncertainties, the price of SOL tends to respond favorably to growth within the Solana ecosystem. The successful performance of Solana SPL tokens, highlighted by the popularity of memecoins, has bolstered the blockchain's attractiveness to new projects, thereby sustaining demand for the SOL token. A 30-day analysis of the Solana network reveals significant increases in user activity and volume, presenting a challenge to a bearish stance on SOL. Solana has notably narrowed the gap with its direct competitor, the BNB Chain (BNB), according to available data. This data highlights that Solana's decentralized application (DApp) volumes saw a 334% increase in the 30 days leading up to March 26. In comparison, its competitors, BNB Chain and Arbitrum recorded growth rates of 146% and 82%, respectively. Moreover, the Solana network's active addresses surged by 43% to 2.66 million over the same period, outperforming the growth rates of BNB Chain\u2019s 15% and Arbitrum\u2019s 30%. Forecasting the flows of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the market's response to a stricter regulatory landscape is impossible, so investors should focus on derivatives trading metrics to gauge market sentiment. Specifically, the behavior of perpetual contracts, often called inverse swaps, offers insights. These contracts include an embedded rate to balance leverage. Notably, a negative rate signals stronger demand from short sellers. Recent observations highlight a strong leverage demand for bullish positions on SOL, seemingly undeterred by the token\u2019s inability to surpass the $195 mark on March 26. Related: Where is Bitcoin heading next? Market experts chime in To further validate whether the inclination toward leveraged long positions mirrors the broader market sentiment, examining the demand for stablecoins in China can be enlightening. This is because such demand serves as an indicator of retail investors\u2019 movements within or outside the cryptocurrency markets. The premium on USD Coin (USDC) transactions, when compared to the official U.S. dollar rate, is particularly telling. On March 26, the USDC premium in China maintained a level above 3%, indicating a strong demand for converting the local CNY into the USDC stablecoin. This trend suggests sustained interest in cryptocurrencies within China, thereby supporting the optimistic outlook in SOL\u2019s derivatives markets. Although it remains uncertain when SOL will breach the $200 threshold, the current on-chain and derivatives metrics suggest a healthy market environment.

In a March 26 letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, U.S. lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Vice Chair French Hill, urged the commission to address crypto firm Prometheum\u2019s intention to offer institutional custody services for Ether.

Visa Token Service (VST), launched in 2014, serves as a bridge between traditional banking account information and digital payment services such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. Essentially, VST replaces the traditional 16-digit credit/debit card number used by consumers to make purchases with a secure numeric token. This allows consumers to share financial information without exposing their private details or banking information. VST operates on VisaNet, the company\u2019s proprietary network that, according to company documentation, is capable of handling more than 56,000 transaction messages a second. One of the more common use cases for tokenized payment methods is for cross-border payments and international travel. Exchanging cash or conducting wire transfers across currency types comes with myriad friction points. The use of tokenized assets such as cryptocurrency or tokenized payment services such as VST can avoid much of the hassle involved in these transactions. A recent study by Visa found that 97% of travelers to the Asia-Pacific region prefer to make payments by means other than cash. In 2023, this led to an average spend of $2,525 per trip. The \u201ctokenization\u201d of traditional assets into digital currencies and payment facilitators has grown significantly in the wake of COVID-19. As travel continues to flourish as the world recovers from the pandemic, the need for international payment methods with low fees and friction has become increasingly cited by consumers as driving factors in how and where they make purchases. Visa\u2019s head of products and solutions for the Asia-Pacific region, TR Ramachandran, said in a press release that tokens \u201cpave the way for the future of commerce.\u201d \u201cThe innovation possibilities are immense with tokenised payment credentials that can unlock new and more personalised consumer experiences beyond physical Visa cards.

The new platform will provide secure data storage and give users control over access to their data, as well as improving processing and reaction times. According to the statement: \u201cThis platform incorporates agile development methods into Web3 technology and develops with an emphasis on speed.

According to Dmytro Kutsenko, founder and CEO of WhiteList Zone, existing OTC whitelist markets operate in a gray area with a high risk of scam. \u201cIt is very easy to lose your money or miss out on an interesting project. And if you want to invest in a Web3 project with tokens, you have to lock up funds across numerous launchpads and do a number of other activities. Whitelisting for new Web3 projects is a real struggle.\u201d https://t.co/W7z22UE3gr \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 20, 2024 Dmytro\u2019 project, WhiteList Zone, is a new whitelist marketplace for early-stage Web3 projects focused on making the process more transparent, secure and accessible. The project became the main topic of Cointelegraph\u2019s discussion on Twitter Spaces. According to Kutsenko, WhiteList Zone sources projects from reputable partners such as exchanges and launchpads. These partners have already vetted the projects to some degree. The marketplace then does its own analysis, looking at project details, social media presence, team composition, and investor interest. \u201cWe don\u2019t take projects off the street without good analysis and due diligence on our part. We look at all of these parameters before accepting a project,\u201d Dmytro said. He also emphasized the importance of social media presence for any project. \u201cCommunities play a big role in our decision, because every good project has a large and active community that remains regardless of the platform,\u201d WhiteList Zone\u2019s CEO said. Influencer support and a professional website (especially for token sales) also indicate a more established and potentially safer investment opportunity. But even high-profile projects can fail, underscoring the inherent risk in any Web3 investment. \u201cAnyone involved in Web3 investment should DYOR for a project they\u2019re going to get in,\u201d he noted. The speaker advised examining elements such as the strength of community engagement on social platforms, the percentage of real followers versus bots, the professionalism of the project\u2019s website, and partners or backers. Speaking further about WhiteList Zone, Kutsenko elaborated on the support they provide to projects: \u201cWe work with various types of Web3 projects, as well as communities and companies. For projects, we provide additional marketing support, offering them additional revenue to promote their initiatives, along with additional perks. For communities, we have a referral system and early investment opportunities for those interested in getting involved in the early stages of promising projects. This robust network is beneficial to individual investors who can access the hottest and most promising projects on the far-flung platforms. For now, NFT projects can apply directly to the WhiteList Zone, while token sale projects are primarily sourced through partners. However, any project can apply for an \u201caccess whitelist,\" which provides early access to exclusive events or limited communities. WhiteList Zone plans to bundle these access whitelists with additional perks from partners and its user community, creating a valuable opportunity for investors. WhiteList Zone is currently in alpha testing. Once fully launched, different whitelists will be open to all users, with a tiered system that leads to potentially more profitable and interesting projects. In addition, an AI analytics tool will be available to users: it will scour publicly available data on each project, analyzing social media presence, team information, and economic factors, and then generate a personalized score and detailed review, enabling users and investors to make informed decisions. The vision for WhiteList Zone is multifaceted, according to Kutsenko: \u201cA platform where anyone can easily and safely access investment opportunities in different types of projects, including closed alphas. We\u2019re building the infrastructure and ecosystem that can become effective marketing tools for projects to engage audiences and raise funds. Meanwhile, launchpads and exchanges can increase their profitability, accelerate the industry and growth through various operational opportunities.\u201d","tags":"#Blockchain, #Cryptocurrencies, #Investments, #Adoption, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Mar 26, 2024","summary":"","author":"Nancy Lubale","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-whale-accumulation-suggests-that-the-pre-halving-btc-rally-will-continue","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin whale accumulation suggests pre-halving BTC rally will continue","type":"Blog","category":"Market Analysis","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) price rose above $71,000 for the first time since March 15 as capital flows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turned positive. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC has risen more than 0.55% over the last 24 hours to hit a weekly high at $71,582 on March 26. Several factors are fueling BTC\u2019s current price movement, including consistent spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the overall positive investor sentiment among institutional investors. Let\u2019s look at the factors behind Bitcoin\u2019s rally on March 26. Large Bitcoin investors have been adding to their holdings in anticipation of price increases in the future. Data from market intelligence firm Santiment shows that the percentage of wallets holding between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC has increased from 23% on Jan. 1 to 25.17% on March 26. As shown in the chart below, the percentage of those holding between 10,000 BTC and 100,000 BTC saw a sharp spike from 11.68% on March 2 to 12.42% on March 21 before slightly dropping to current levels of 11.98% Bitcoin whale accumulation is supported by reducing BTC deposits on exchanges. According to Glassnode data, the number of deposit transactions to known exchange wallets started decreasing on March 5, when BTC\u2019s price climbed above $69,000.This drop continued on March 19 despite the price falling more than 9% on the day to close below $65,000, with deposits to exchanges declining from 109,420 transactions to 55,505 on March 25. TheDecreasing transfer of BTC to exchanges suggests a lack of intent to sell, which is generally a bullish sign. Instead, there has been an increase in the number of whales transferring Bitcoin from exchanges. On March 11, blockchain tracker and analytics firm Whale Alert flagged several transactions transferring large amounts of BTC from exchanges to self-custody wallets. On March 25, one holder transferred 2,400 BTC, worth $169.5 million, from the Coinbase crypto exchange to an unknown new wallet. Another whale withdrew 4,797 BTC, worth about $339 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet. In a recent report, market data provider Glassnode said, \u201cThe significant buying power of ETFs is set to overshadow the traditional supply squeeze effect expected from\u201d the upcoming Bitcoin halving set for April this year. Glassnode analyst Marcin Mi≈Çosierny wrote that the \u201csupply dynamics of Bitcoin are increasingly influenced by the actions of long-term holders (LTHs).\u201d Mi≈Çosierny advised traders to \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the activity of LTHs, as their \u201cdecisions to sell or hold can significantly impact market liquidity and sentiment.\u201d The analyst added: \u201cReaching an ATH before the halving presents a new scenario, yet the cycle\u2019s progression mirrors past trends if aligned from the April 2021 ATH. \u201d As the name implies, the Bitcoin supply halving is an event where the reward for mining new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain is cut in half. After the next halving, the BTC rewards issued to miners per block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital shared a chart showing the \u201c4 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving\u201d in a March 25 post on the X social network, saying the \u201ccurrent cycle has been a story of Re-Accumulation Ranges\u201d and adding that there is a \u201cpossibility for price going into the Halving is further consolidation at highs\u201d \u2014 the \u201cRe-Accumulation\u201d phase. As Bitcoin\u2019s halving draws near, investors are rushing to place their best positions for the event. Related: Bitcoin ETFs see $15M comeback as BTC price taps best close in 10 days Bitcoin traders and analysts are now focusing on the next level for BTC after its rally back above $70,000. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that whales added more than 80,000 BTC when the price dropped to $64,000. According to the blockchain analytics firm, this buying appears to be the momentum \u201cbehind Bitcoin\u2019s move back to the $70K range.\u201d The firm\u2019s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) model shows that BTC sits on relatively strong support around the $64,000 level compared with the resistance it faces in its recovery path. What is clear is that traders are determined to hold the price above $70,000. According to independent analyst Daan Crypto Trades, investors should be ready for a \u201ccrazy\u201d rise as $100,000 becomes the focus for the BTC price.

The Dogecoin chart fractal below highlights the similarities between DOGE's ongoing price performance and those recording after the completion of the 2018-2020 bear market. For instance, in 2018-2020, Dogecoin experienced a prolonged sideways movement within the $0.0012 to $0.0056 range. This phase occurred at the chart\u2019s base levels, between the 0.236 and 0.0 Fibonacci retracement lines, underlining a period of relative market equilibrium with low volatility. Mirroring the earlier consolidation pattern, Dogecoin has \u2014 once again \u2014 entered a consolidation phase, but at a higher price range between $0.055 and $0.181. Interestingly, these new bounds also align with the 0.236 and 0.0 Fib retracement levels, respectively. The current attempt to surpass the 0.236 Fibonacci threshold is akin to the breakout observed in the previous cycle, which may indicate a significant shift in market sentiment if the price sustains above this level, currently at $0.181. Fundamentals such as quantitative easing played a key role in sending Dogecoin prices up by more than 15,800% in 2020. Interestingly, the memecoin market is witnessing similar catalysts in 2024 as it attempts to break above its 0.236 Fib line resistance. In 2020, Dogecoin's price surged past its 0.236 Fibonacci level, partly fueled by increased cash liquidity resulting from the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy of lowering interest rates. Likewise, Dogecoin's current efforts to breach the 0.236 Fibonacci threshold coincide with the anticipation of three potential interest rate cuts in 2024. Dogecoin\u2019s 2024 price trends draw further similarities from the 2020 fractal due to the occurrence of Bitcoin halving, events that halve the reward for mining new blocks. Remarkably, following Bitcoin's third halving on July 11, 2020, Dogecoin's price surged by an astonishing 34,300%. Similarly, after Bitcoin's second halving, Dogecoin experienced a rally of over 6,350%, showcasing its potential for delivering high returns to investors seeking opportunities in alternative cryptocurrencies after halvings.

Elon Musk's active and public support of Dogecoin during 2020 and 2021 played a crucial role in its dramatic price increases while elevating its ranking among the top cryptocurrencies. Now, in 2024, the billionaire entrepreneur is eyeing a move toward integrating DOGE into mainstream platforms. For instance, on March 14, Musk said his electric vehicle company, Tesla, could add DOGE payments for purchasing cars at some point in the future. Furthermore, Musk\u2019s \u201ceverything app\u201d X (previously known as Twitter) established an XPayments account for its forthcoming payment functionality. There\u2019s a growing expectation that the X app will roll out in-app payment capabilities by mid-2024, which may include cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Technically, Dogecoin\u2019s weekly relative strength index (RSI) has crossed above 70, an overbought zone, which raises its potential to enter a correction or consolidation phase in April. Nonetheless, a clear breakout above the 0.236 Fib resistance could send DOGE's price toward the 0.382 Fib line at around $0.26 by April's end. That is up approximately 35% from current price levels. Conversely, a decisive pullback from the 0.236 Fib line risks bringing Dogecoin's price toward its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) at around $0.095, down about 48% from current prices.

Gone are the days of a standard laptop providing enough hardware for Bitcoin (BTC) mining. As the April Bitcoin halving fast approaches, BTC mining difficulty \u2014 a measure of how difficult it is to create one new BTC \u2014 recorded new historical highs in mid-March with 83 trillion hashes, which refers to the amount of processing and computing power being given to the network through mining. The ever-increasing costs of Bitcoin mining hardware and the skyrocketing difficulty form a barrier for users who want to participate in building the future of money. The discussion of Bitcoin mining for individuals has shifted from maintaining expensive hardware and looking for cheap electricity to finding a way-through solution that can simplify their entrance to the mining market by decreasing the cost and leveraging the risks. GoMining, a Bitcoin mining provider known for its innovative Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate (LBH) protocol, introduces a flexible and gamified approach to BTC mining by attributing its computing power to nonfungible tokens (NFTs) as real-world value. Backed by a fleet of in-house BTC mining devices, GoMining NFTs enable a simple way to start mining instantly for individuals. GoMining, a member of the Bitcoin Mining Council, distributes daily mining rewards generated from its nine data centers in different countries to holders of GoMining NFTs proportional to the amount of mining power and energy efficiency they opt for. For seamless global access to daily BTC mining, GoMining has launched the Mine Box Collection with a new miner generation logic. Instead of offering specific starting computing power and energy efficiency attributes, Mine Box NFTs are fully scalable, ranging from 1 to 5,000 terahashes per second. Once the initial mining power is selected, the user can pay with Tether (USDT), GOMINING tokens or any available fiat payment method to generate an NFT exclusively crafted for them. Mine Box NFTs have an energy efficiency level equal to 35 W/TH, which can be upgraded to 20 W/TH \u2014 an efficiency level comparable to the most modern ASICS in the market. The platform also offers users access to advanced analytics with key insights, including a historical data-based mining calculator, readily available whenever a BTC miner is purchased or upgraded. Users who don\u2019t want to take volatility risks and see predictable results can take the Bitcoin mining route with GoMining, which provides a lifetime ownership of real share of Bitcoin mining power by holding an NFT that distributes daily rewards. GoMining strives to provide equal and seamless access to Bitcoin mining for everyone, enabling users to generate value from Bitcoin mining without the need to maintain costly infrastructure on their own.  GoMining has nine data centers located in different parts of the world. Source: GoMining GoMining CEO Mark Zalan said that the team\u2019s mission is to provide customers access to the constantly growing Bitcoin mining market, adding: \u201cBy focusing on individuals, we aim to open up the fledgling industry to a much broader pool of supporters, allowing them to share in the financial and technological advancements happening right now.\u201d GoMining continues to build new data centers around the world to make BTC mining accessible to a broader audience, with the goal of achieving 25 million terahashes per second in 2025. The future of Bitcoin mining lies in solutions that prioritize sustainability, accessibility and efficiency. With each advancement, the world moves closer to a future where Bitcoin mining is not just a pursuit for the technically adept or financially robust but a viable, rewarding endeavor for anyone passionate about contributing to the blockchain revolution.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Mining, #Bitcoin Mining, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #NFT"},{"date":"Mar 26, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-block-art-marathon","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin block art? Marathon showcases visualization potential of block building","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"A Bitcoin Core contributor has immortalized Marathon Digital\u2019s logo into the data visualization of a Bitcoin block by using the mining firm\u2019s template building tools. X user Portland.HODL laid claim to the intriguing piece of \u201cblock art\u201d, a custom graphic crafted by ordering transactions in a block that can be then seen on Bitcoin indexer website. Blockchain indexers visualize bitcoin transactions using square blocks and color gradients based on transaction sizes and fee rates. Marathon Digital shared details of block 836361 which it successfully mined on March 26. The firm dubbed it the M block and wanted the visualization to demonstrate its template building capabilities and technology stack. The company explained that by owning its mining pool, it can craft the order of transactions to create a form of block art. While not offering this specific output capability as a service, the mining company speculated that this could present a wave of creative potential not yet explored in the Bitcoin space. Related: Bitcoin halving will be a litmus test for inefficient ops: Mining execs Marathon also noted that the Bitcoin network should exclude blocks from full pay-per-share (FPPS) calculations to ensure more accurate miner fee estimates. This is to avoid any effect that Marathon\u2019s experiments might have on network fees. Portland.HODL claims to have successfully crafted the block\u2019s visualization through a long process of trial and error. The process of creating this block art made use of OP_RETURN transactions in the Bitcoin protocol. This is a type of transaction that allows for a small amount of arbitrary data to be included in a transaction. The data is typically used for embedding messages or metadata onchain. If a user carefully crafts the content of these OP_RETURN transactions and orders them correctly, an image or pattern emerges when the block data is visualized. Before a block is mined, all transactions wait in an area called the mempool. A miner can create numerous transactions to generate this kind of art once mined into a block. They would develop transactions with outputs that, when visualized, correspond to the pixels of the desired image. Creating block art would also require a miner to modify their software to select specific transactions that will form the desired pattern instead of prioritizing transactions that maximize profit based on the fee density or satoshis per byte.

The last Bitcoin halving \u2014 where rewards for mining a block are sliced in half roughly every four years \u2014 saw Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) volatility index go beyond 9%. So far, there have been three halvings \u2014 in 2012, 2016, and 2020 \u2014 with the next halving expected to occur in mid-April. While investors holding Bitcoin don\u2019t have to do anything, its impact on the market could mean a lot to them and the asset as a retail investment tool. Bitcoin\u2019s rollercoaster cycles can be tempting to investors looking for short-term gains. And while Bitcoin\u2019s halving events have historically been followed by price appreciation, every analyst will tell investors that past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. In equities markets, analysts often say that \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market,\u201d and the same can be said about Bitcoin. Blockchain.com president Lane Kasselman told Cointelegraph that it\u2019s \u201cgenerally not recommended to try to time the market in the Bitcoin space.\u201d According to Kasselman, a \u201cgreat deal of past predictive models have proven to be completely inaccurate.\u201d Instead, a suggested strategy would be to dollar-cost average, which means buying small, fixed amounts of Bitcoin on a regular basis, regardless of its price. Dollar-cost averaging is a method that helps reduce the emotional impact of investing, instead allowing investors to use a fixed schedule. While this means that investors may miss out on significant gains as they wait for their scheduled investment, they can also avoid the significant drawdowns that characterize the cryptocurrency market. Kate Lifshits, partnerships lead at cryptocurrency exchange ChangeNOW, told Cointelegraph that for retail investors, it\u2019s \u201ccrucial to find that perfect balance between the excitement of amazing but potential gains and the hard reality of increased volatility.\u201d She advised investors to do their own research and \u201capproach with caution, diversify their portfolios and manage risks effectively.\u201d Lifshits said that savvy investors know to look beyond the hype surrounding Bitcoin and consider factors that can influence its price, including inflation, macroeconomic trends and the technology underpinning the network. Going beyond the hype and practicing proper risk management also involves proper education, as investors who have a clear strategy and know their risk profile are less likely to give in to emotions. Emotional trading often leads to impulsive decisions, which in a volatile market can be made just before a major change in price direction. Vishal Sacheendran, Binance\u2019s head of regional markets, told Cointelegraph that it\u2019s essential for investors to \u201cthoroughly comprehend the crypto industry and the specific asset they\u2019re investing in.\u201d According to Sacheendran, aligning individuals\u2019 understanding of their unique risk tolerance with their own research \u201ccan help shape an investment strategy that serves their needs.\u201d He added: \u201cThe process of self-education helps investors understand these different characteristics, use cases, values and ultimately how to balance potential gains and risks.\u201d Sacheendran noted the \u201cincreasing wealth of information out there for everyone\u201d to learn more about the space. Recent: Bitcoin ETFs could soften BTC price retracement before the halving Charles Chong, director of strategy at cryptocurrency mining firm Foundry Digital, told Cointelegraph that retail investors who aren\u2019t engaged in daily trading \u201cshould adopt a long-term horizon,\u201d as \u201cunderstanding the core reason behind holding Bitcoin\u201d is paramount. This allows investors to \u201cremain steadfast amid the market\u2019s short-term fluctuations often following halving events.\u201d While education and forming an investment strategy are important steps, investors must also be aware of the macro influences on Bitcoin price. Bitcoin is still a relatively small commodity compared with other asset classes like equities or fixed income and isn\u2019t immune to global macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rates. Thomas Perfumo, head of strategy at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, told Cointelegraph that rising expectations of falling interest rates in developed countries have \u201csupported the risk-on trend playing out across asset classes, including equities and crypto.\u201d Investors, he said, turned to assets like Bitcoin because of persistently high inflation, how easy these assets are to access and their ability to act as a store of value. Becky Sarwate, head of communications at crypto exchange CEX.IO, told Cointelegraph that ahead of the upcoming halving, the overall health in equities markets, coupled with the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, could be supporting BTC\u2019s recent price rise \u2014 but she noted that \u201cboom times always come to an end.\u201d She said that part of what attracts investors to Bitcoin is its \u201cinternal safeguards against inflation,\u201d which are partly exemplified by its halvings, adding: \u201cThese structural bulwarks slow the trickle of BTC discovery and anchor its circulating capacity to avoid a glut in supply. As interest rates cool, traders and institutional investors will have more capital to deploy across speculative markets.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s popularity with retail investors can be traced back to its roots, as it started off publicized through newsletters and forums through word-of-mouth, with no central entity behind it. In its early years, liquidity was too thin for large players to enter the market without making a splash, and its unproven history kept institutions at bay. This meant that sentiment about Bitcoin often revolved around price action, not activity on-chain or the cryptocurrency\u2019s development. Social media hype specifically targeting retail investors focused heavily on what\u2019s going on in the markets rather than under the hood. Sacheendran said that crypto is a \u201cunique asset class where retail investors manage to gain exposure earlier than institutional investors.\u201d This, Sacheendran said, has resulted in \u201crobust community involvement\u201d that can see a lot of hype around significant events like halvings that generate a lot of noise, making it critical for investors to be able to \u201cremain focused on the essential aspects when making decisions.\u201d To Kraken\u2019s Perfumo, there\u2019s more to it. Bitcoin\u2019s halvings, he said, remind us \u201cof Bitcoin\u2019s sound money design,\u201d as the cryptocurrency combines limited supply with global liquidity, divisibility, value density, decentralization and censorship-resistant access to an online market. He added: \u201cWe think it\u2019s the most superior form of sound money. This fourth halving is symbolic in that the growth in Bitcoin\u2019s annual supply will fall to less than 1% for the first time in its history, and ~94% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist will have been mined by this April.\u201d However, given that halvings are highly predictable \u2014 occurring every 210,000 blocks \u2014 and Bitcoin has risen over 70% so far this year, one has to wonder whether the event is already priced in. The halving\u2019s predictability could, according to the efficient market hypothesis \u2014 which states that asset prices reflect all available information \u2014 mean that its impact is already reflected in the market. Nikita Zuborev, chief analyst at exchange directory BestChange, told Cointelegraph that the halving is \u201cabsolutely\u201d priced in and is one of the factors behind BTC\u2019s rise this year. According to Zuborev, historical data \u201cshows that the halving factor is included in the price a year before the event\u201d but is only reflected months after the halving due to the \u201ctime lag between miners accumulating and selling\u201d their coins on exchanges. Binance\u2019s Sacheendran noted that despite broad awareness of the halving, past events have nevertheless led to dramatic price swings and surges. Kraken\u2019s Perfumo said the question of whether the Bitcoin halving is already priced has arisen during every previous cycle and always ends in surprise when the market performs well. He suggested that instead, observers should look at how far cryptocurrency adoption has come along. Perfumo said that as of 2023, estimates \u201csuggest that 10% or less of the global population has adopted crypto in some capacity,\u201d adding: \u201cThese market cycles bring a lot of new interest, which accelerates the adoption rate of crypto. If you believe in the empirical trajectory of adoption in other technological disruptions, adoption usually hits a \u2018tipping point\u2019 where it starts to accelerate significantly. This is the bigger story, and the question is whether the halving in of itself supports growth in adoption.\u201d Given this context, the symbolism of this halving dramatically strengthens Bitcoin\u2019s narrative of sound money and could be more relatable to a mass audience. Nevertheless, Perfumo suggested that the halving is \u201cunlikely to drive wider use of Bitcoin as a currency.\u201d For adoption to grow, Bitcoin would have to be less volatile and used to buy everyday products and services while being more affordable for these transactions. Innovations, including layer-2 scaling solutions, are moving in that direction, but the halving wouldn\u2019t help here. To CEX.IO\u2019s Sarwate, halvings are \u201cgreat for generating buzz,\u201d but there\u2019s little about them that \u201cargues for BTC\u2019s everyday use.\u201d Instead, these events underline Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, a sentiment echoed by ChangeNOW\u2019s Lifshits, who noted that by reducing issuance, halvings reinforce \u201cBitcoin\u2019s deflationary nature.\u201d Lifshits added that halvings make Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a \u201clong-term store of value and medium of exchange in the digital age\u201d clear and move the conversation away from price speculation to its broader utility in the future of the financial system. The future of Bitcoin and the makeup of the industry supporting it will be defined by the long-term impact of these halving events, according to Charlie Schumacher, vice president of corporate communications at Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings. He told Cointelegraph that halvings are of crucial importance for miners, who play \u201can indispensable role in upholding Bitcoin\u2019s integrity\u201d and must find innovative ways to ensure their work continues profitably. Blockchain.com\u2019s Kasselman said that halvings have historically represented a significant shock for Bitcoin\u2019s supply, with the first bringing the number of BTC produced yearly from 12% to 6% of the total supply. Kasselman added that the second halving brought that number to 3%, and because 90% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply has now been mined, these havings will start having a smaller impact. Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s To him, investors shouldn\u2019t focus on the short-term implications of these events but should instead move to understand why Bitcoin has been getting so much attention since it first launched: \u201cThese halvings that take place every four years demonstrate that Bitcoin is now the most scarce fungible asset in the world, which has the potential to completely change the way we think about money, savings and investments.\u201d The upcoming Bitcoin halving is a reminder of Bitcoin\u2019s core appeal as a scarce, decentralized asset. And while its impact is hard to predict with certainty, it\u2019s a reminder that Bitcoin\u2019s long-term scarcity remains assured. Approaching the halving with caution and doing your own research while maintaining a long-term perspective is critical as Bitcoin ultimately moves, over time, closer to truly being the future of finance.

Worldcoin operates through scanning individual\u2019s irises via its Orb devices, which it exchanges for a digital ID and its own cryptocurrency. Worldcoin was founded by Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of artificial intelligence developer OpenAI. According to the company, over 4.5 million people in 120 countries have signed up with Worldcoin. Portugal reports that 300,000 people have already provided their biometric data for the project. The CNPD said these measures come after receiving \u201cdozens of reports\u201d on the collection of data from minors without the proper authorization from parents or legal authorities. It stated: \u201cGiven the current circumstances, in which there is illegality in the processing of minors\u2019 biometric data, associated with potential violations of other GDPR standards, the CNPD understood that the risk to citizens\u2019 fundamental rights is high, justifying urgent intervention to prevent serious or irreparable damage.\u201d Related: Data privacy and security concerns worry nearly half of tech industry consumers: Report Paula Meira Louren√ßo, president of the CNPD, called the measure \u201cindispensable and justified\u201d to effectively defend the public interest in safeguarding fundamental rights, especially those of minors. The complaint was addressed to the Worldcoin Foundation, which is the entity behind the Worldcoin data collection initiative. These troubles follow a slew of other complaints from regulators around the world. Kenya\u2019s government continued to uphold its ban on the project despite what it said was \u201cpressure\u201d from the United States to relax its stance. Legal authorities in Spain have also told Worldcoin to cease activity in the country after complaints that local users could not withdraw their consent. It was also alleged that data collection was being collected from minors. Despite these bans, on March 18, Worldcoin released a statement assuring that it operates \u201clawfully in all of the locations in which it is available\u201d and is designed to fully comply with related laws. On March 22, the project announced that it would be open-sourcing its software and providing a new \u201cpersonal custody\u201d privacy feature to give users more control over their data.

Curio alerted its community of the exploit and highlighted that they are addressing the situation. The company said that a MakerDAO-based smart contract used within Curio was breached. However, the company assured its users that the exploit only affected the Ethereum side and that all Polkadot and the Curio Chain contracts remained secure. Web3 security firm Cyvers estimated that the losses from the exploit are about $16 million.

With this, the attacker acquired a small number of Curio Governance (CGT) tokens, allowing them to gain access and elevate their voting power in the project\u2019s smart contract. With the elevated voting power, the attacker performed a series of steps that ultimately allowed the execution of arbitrary actions within the Curio DAO contract. This led to the unauthorized minting of 1 billion CGT. In the report, Curio said all the funds affected in the exploit will be returned. The team said it would release a new token called CGT 2.0.

Slow transactions and high latency due to the scalability issues on many blockchain infrastructures are inherently incompatible with the dynamic nature of the gaming world. Development and implementation operational costs tend to skyrocket due to inadequate software development kits (SDKs) and a lack of interoperability between games and gaming platforms. Many modern games require fast processing to keep the gameplay enjoyable, and this is where layer-2 (L2) solutions with highly tailored features come forth. L2 networks have the potential to smoothen the experience for both developers and end-users, facilitating a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps) \u2014 including Web3 games \u2014 to be built on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). GAIMIN, the DePIN provider and a decentralized data processing network, has launched its L2 blockchain in partnership with BNB Chain and Movement Labs to deliver Web3 technology and services to the gaming industry. BREAKING üì¢@GaiminIo, @movementlabsxyz and @BNBChain collaborate to create the fastest gaming blockchain in the world. A Move language based L2 on BSC with 150k TPS, the lowest latency, native gaming and DePIN features, and watched by millions of gamers. Litepaper linküëáüèº pic.twitter.com/XehAFxWq49 \u2014 GAIMIN (@GaiminIo) February 21, 2024 The L2 gaming blockchain by GAIMIN aims to lower the barriers for game developers who seek to move their projects to Web3. It removes the requirement for high-performance hardware to process a blockchain transaction while rewarding users for allowing their devices to participate in the network. As BNB Chain\u2019s \u201cPartner for Web3 Esports Growth Initiatives,\u201d GAIMIN is working closely with opBNB \u2014 the L2 solution for BNB Chain \u2014 to deliver frictionless L2 functionality. Technology developed by Movement Labs, the global network of modular blockchains, also enables the GAIMIN L2 blockchain to process over 150,000 transactions per second on the blockchain while significantly lowering the L2 confirmation latency and reducing gas fees through batching and compressing data. The strategic partnerships help GAIMIN offer an L2 network with high speed, low latency and scalable Web3 services to the gaming industry. The new platform is powered by the gaimin.cloud, a DePIN of PC-based devices delivering more efficient blockchain transactions and critical tasks for game development, such as video rendering and artificial intelligence (AI) data processing. The DePIN enables the creation of networks that focus on different processing requirements and provide different levels of performance and capacity. Through gaimin.cloud, GAIMIN has access to large numbers of globally available processing hardware. For example, if an AI data processing task specifically needs an NVIDIA graphic processing unit (GPU), the GAIMIN L2 blockchain can find the matching GPUs from the DePIN, create a subnetwork for this task and forward any upcoming AI data processing jobs to that subnetwork. Gamers can use GAIMIN\u2019s PC app to allow their devices to participate in the network and receive rewards commensurate with their level of data processing participation. Each device can become a blockchain node, increasing resilience and speeding up approvals. The gas fees paid for each transaction will be returned back to the users as part of GAIMIN\u2019s strategy, thereby making gamers the driving force behind their own dedicated gaming blockchain. GAIMIN CEO Martin Speight stressed that \u201cGAIMIN was set up by gamers, for gamers with a philosophy of \u2018No Gamer Left Behind.\u2019\u201d He added that GAIMIN\u2019s DePIN, gaimin.cloud, puts gamers in a pivotal position in the transformation of the gaming industry. \u201cBuilding the gaming L2 blockchain on BNB Chain, with opBNB, Movement Labs technology and GAIMIN\u2019s DePIN will deliver the paradigm shift for the gaming industry to move to Web3.\u201d As Web3 gaming evolves, it promises a future where fast, immersive experiences are the norm, enabled by technologies overcoming today\u2019s scalability and cost barriers. From its Web3 Games Launcher to the L2 blockchain and DePIN, GAIMIN aims to contribute to this shift to foster an inclusive, community-driven gaming ecosystem.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Adoption, #Games, #Web3, #Gaming"},{"date":"Mar 26, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ana Paula Pereira","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/lower-etf-demand-btc-selling-pressure-post-halving","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Lower ETF demand, unrealized gains may weigh on BTC selling pressure post-halving","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"A slowdown of inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combined with a high volume of unrealized gains from traders could lead to bearish pressure on the Bitcoin price after the upcoming halving event. According to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, unrealized profits from Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally are driving up selling pressure. An eventual slowdown of inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months could result in further pressure on Bitcoin (BTC) prices. CryptoQuant\u2019s net unrealized profit and oss (NUPL) indicator supports the analysis. The indicator\u2019s warning sign is the 0.7 mark, indicating that Bitcoin investors may be ready to take profits, further driving prices down and increasing selling pressure. On March 17, the NUPL indicator reached 0.606, up 0.41% from the previous 24 hours, despite recent BTC price corrections. \u201cFor a bearish outlook for price: 1. Slowdown in ETF Bitcoin purchases and 2. Getting into the halving at a high level of unrealized profits for traders, as highly likely traders would sell to take profits,\u201d Moreno said about possible price-depressing events. The Bitcoin ETFs recorded one of their lowest net inflow days on March 14, with just $132 million in net activity, their lowest level in eight trading sessions and an 80% decline from the previous days. A possible downward trend, however, may not be as severe as previous bear markets, as institutional investors typically engage in portfolio rebalancing strategies, which could temper volatility rather than increase it, James Butterfill, head of Research at CoinShares, told Cointelegraph. \u201cVolatility in the last bull market in 2021 was 120%. It is now only 45%, and prices have risen above all-time highs. We believe this is due to the dampening effect of portfolio rebalancing,\u201d he said. Bitcoin ETFs have so far been in high demand. The cumulative net inflows into the crypto products surpassed the $12 billion mark on March 15, while industry insiders anticipate further demand as brokerage firms speed up due diligence to offer clients Bitcoin ETFs. Capital flowing through Bitcoin ETFs is counteracting the negative price effects of miners sales ahead of the halving \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary mechanism. The halving cuts the reward for mining new blocks by 50%, thus reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin are generated. This year\u2019s reduction will slash Bitcoin miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. The cost of mining, however, remains the same or may even increase as miners usually improve operations to remain profitable after the event. CoinShares anticipates the average cost of production post-halving for crypto miners to be at $37,856. \u201cLooking at price performance of the miners year to date highlights investor concerns for the miners around the halving, but I believe many are being tarred with the same brush, so to speak, as average costs to mine Bitcoin vary greatly, but those with higher costs to seem to have been hit harder,\u201d said Butterfill. Historically, miners have sold more of their BTC reserves before the halving to maximize profits, and 2024 is no exception. Data from CryptoQuant shows miner reserves at their lowest level in two years, with 1.81 million Bitcoin held by miners on March 15. The Bitcoin halving takes place every four years, with the next expected to happen around April 19, 2024.

On March 25, the IMF published a report on the potential role of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on the economies of the Pacific Islands countries. In a 58-page text, the IMF\u2019s senior economic experts highlighted the challenges faced by the dozens of countries and microstates located in a Pacific Islands area: \u201cLimited and unequal access to financial services contributes to persistent poverty and inequality. The countries also are highly dependent on remittance flows, which makes them disproportionately impacted by diminishing correspondent banking relationships.\u201d The IMF believes these nations can benefit from the digital money revolution by developing payment systems, expanding financial inclusion and mitigating the loss of correspondent banking relationships. Related: Global policymakers are still pushing CBDCs despite their failures While the report predictably focuses on CBDCs, a cause heavily advocated by the IMF, it also mentions private stablecoins backed by foreign currencies. The IMF discourages smaller Pacific Island countries (PICs) from issuing their own sovereign stablecoins due to the lack of oversight capacities. However, the only private stablecoin explicitly mentioned in the report is Tether (USDT). Overall, the report states that the best option for PICs with existent national currency and mature banks is a two-tier CBDC, whereby the central bank issues but delegates the operation to private intermediaries. As for others: \u201cForeign currency\u2013based stablecoins could be a realistic alternative for countries without their own currencies, though only with robust regulation and supervision.\u201d As the summary of current PICs\u2019 financial systems shows, none of them officially uses private crypto or stablecoins, while only several \u2014 Fiji, Palau, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu \u2014 are exploring a CBDC. The IMF remains one of the leading international advocates for implementing CBDCs.

A Bitfinex report delving into market dynamics around the upcoming Bitcoin halving unpacks a changing dynamic in the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem over the past decade. It suggests that publicly listed Bitcoin mining firms mark a shift away from a decentralized vision of individual miners contributing to the security of the network for personal gain. \u201cThese corporate entities, with their focus squarely on shareholder returns, operate on a vastly different scale and with distinct priorities compared to their smaller counterparts,\u201d an excerpt reads. The report highlights the imperative to maximize profitability and manage investor expectations as a critical reason for strategic decisions prioritizing financial performance over the Bitcoin community\u2019s altruistic ideals. Related: Bitcoin halving will be a litmus test for inefficient ops: Mining execs These are other qualities and ideals inherent to Bitcoin, which include securing the Bitcoin network, egalitarian access to the network and censorship resistance. The current landscape offers both opportunities and challenges the network\u2019s foundational principles. The analysts note that the influx of capital and \u201cprofessionalization\u201d of mining operations by publicly traded firms can lead to increased hashing power, potentially enhancing the overall security and stability of the Bitcoin network. Conversely, this leads to concerns about centralization and the influence of corporate interests, given that Bitcoin\u2019s network was intended to be open, borderless and resistant to control by single entities. \u201cAs these companies grow and consolidate their position, the Bitcoin community watches closely to ensure that the network\u2019s decentralized ethos and the principles of Satoshi\u2019s game theory design remain intact, even as the mining landscape evolves,\u201d the analysts explain. The report also suggests that \u201cWall Street funding\u201d in corporate mining has fundamentally altered the incentive structure of the network. The resource disparity favors corporate miners\u2019 ability to scale operations, secure more affordable energy contracts, and invest in emerging technology. The Bitfinex report adds that large-scale miners increase their efficiency and profitability at a scale unreachable by the average individual miner or large independent competitor.

Questions over the future of independent miners, hobbyists and the geographic spread of the network\u2019s hash rate all come into focus. The report states that independent miners must innovate and collaborate to ensure viability. Mining pools offer a means for smaller miners to combine computational power for shared rewards to remain competitive. Hobby mining\u2019s sustainability could hinge on continuous innovation in mining technology and methods, including developing more energy-efficient hardware and exploiting renewable energy sources. The analysts also highlight the geographical diversification of mining as a critical factor in maintaining the network\u2019s decentralization. Emerging markets with access to renewable or untapped energy resources offer fertile ground for mining operations.

Bakkt\u2019s incoming president and CEO, Andy Main, said the company will focus on several initiatives this year. The executive explained: \u201cOur focus for 2024 is on a set of strategic initiatives that will provide our business with efficient scale, including broadening our client network, expanding our product set and prudently managing expenses.\u201d Within the report, the company also published its expectations for its performance in 2024. According to the company, it is expecting full-year revenue of between $3.2 billion to $5.1 billion. This includes gross crypto revenues of $3.2 billion to $5 billion. However, it also expects its crypto costs to be similar to its revenue in crypto, seemingly predicting to break even in its crypto business. Related: Bakkt shifts focus to custody services, adds support for DOGE, SHIB, other coins Main said in the report that its new balance sheet helped put the company in a position to alleviate conditions that placed doubt in the company\u2019s ability to continue. On Feb. 7, Bakkt filed an amendment to its quarterly report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, with a section containing a note that it may \u201cnot be able to continue as a going concern.\u201d This meant the company was running low on cash to fund its operations in the next year. However, with its latest report showing positive results, Main said that this alleviated the conditions that raised concerns about its capabilities to continue its business. Furthermore, the company\u2019s incoming president expressed excitement about the crypto space\u2019s improving market conditions and said it would help them execute their key priorities and drive the company toward profitability.

ARK also offloaded 275,933 and 128,137 HOOD shares from the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), respectively. ARK\u2019s latest Robinhood sale is the largest one since the company started actively stacking HOOD stock last year. The sales came amid Robinhood seeing significant success, with its price surging 36% over the past 30 days.

That strength continued after the close, with Bitcoin heading past the $71,000 mark at the time of writing. Commenting on the latest market events, financial commentator Tedtalksmacro noted that the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had returned to net inflows. These had seen \u201cred\u201d flow days throughout the week prior, with weak uptake combined with record outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). \u201cAfter 5 consecutive outflow days, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw +$15.4M USD flow in on Monday. +262M from Fidelity,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThe bid is back.\u201d While GBTC outflows remained significant at $350 million, per data from United Kingdom-based investment firm Farside, BTC/USD managed to shrug off any barriers to the upside. In a characteristically optimistic outlook on what might be to come, popular trader and analyst Matthew Hyland thus saw the path toward six-figure BTC price territory reopening. \u201cIf this turns into the clearing of this final area for Bitcoin then increased likelihood of a run up to $100k is incoming,\u201d he told X followers. Previously, Hyland revealed a reset on a classic BTC price metric to levels that last occurred when Bitcoin traded at $40,000 in late January. Daily relative strength index (RSI) values flushing below the key 50 level on March 20, he subsequently concluded, had been a \u201cgood signal\u201d for the rebound.

In a March 25 post to X, Santiment wrote that Osmosis had seen over 169 commits on GitHub in the last 30 days. The decentralized perpetuals exchange dYdX stood in second place with 145 commits, while derivatives liquidity protocol Synthetix came in third with 116.

The total value locked (TVL) and overall trading volumes on Osmosis significantly increased between early October and March 15. Much of the uptick in activity can be traced back to a surge of interest in airdrop farming on Cosmos-related infrastructure throughout the wider crypto sector, with Osmosis being the primary DEX on Cosmos. Several projects, such as data availability blockchain network Celestia and multilayer RollApp deployer Dymension, use core elements of the Cosmos ecosystem for their networks and have now yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in airdrops for farmers.

The dYdX v4 network has generated over $60 billion worth of trading volume since going live on Jan. 25, per DefiLlama data. Meanwhile, the TVL on the Synthetix protocol has also been steadily increasing since mid-February and currently stands at $994 million across the Ethereum and Optimism networks.

The reduced reliance on Geth helps to address a long-feared centralization risk for Ethereum, with concerns a critical bug in an execution client with a 66% or more share could stop the chain from finalizing. One commentator however, warns that the industry shouldn't decalre victory just yet though. On March 22, Coinbase Cloud revealed that \u201croughly 50%\u201d of its validators switched to Nethermind, which helped bump the execution client\u2019s share up to 22%, according to Client Diversity. Besu owns a 10% share of Ethereum validators, while Erigon \u2014 which is also being supported by Coinbase \u2014 has a 2% share, bringing the total minority client share to around 34%. Execution clients on Ethereum play a major role in handling transactions and executing smart contracts on the blockchain. Geth is widely regarded as the most advanced client. However, its strong preference among Ethereum validators has led to an imbalance in execution client diversity over the last few years. \"We can\u2019t declare victory yet,\u201d Lachlan Feeney, founder and CEO of Ethereum infrastructure firm Labrys told Cointelegraph. Feeney claims the methodology Client Diversity uses to obtain its figures is flawed and that Geth needs to move a \u201cdecent amount below the 66% threshold to account for any margin of error before we are confident that a supermajority bug isn\u2019t possible.\u201d The \u201creal victory\u201d cannot be declared until no singular client controls greater than a 33% share, Feeney added. He emphasized the importance of solo staking in diversifying executions clients, which would also prevent those stakers from being subjected to a supermajority bug on Geth. Related: Vitalik Buterin on fix for Ethereum centralization: Make running nodes easier Ethereum decentralization advocate \u201cSuperphiz\u201d recently voiced that a critical bug in Geth could potentially wipeout 80% or more of Ether (ETH) staked on the network.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has seen daily outflows since its launch on Jan. 11 \u2014 totaling over $14 billion as of March 25. Many, including Bianco Research founder and former Wall Street analyst Jim Bianco, have pointed to GBTC\u2019s fees as \u201cthe problem.\u201d In a March 25 X post, he speculated at least half of GBTC outflows were those moving to lower-fee ETFs. Grayscale\u2019s ETF charges a 1.5% per year management fee, five times that of the 0.30% average of the other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bianco said two possible reasons why Grayscale doesn\u2019t drop the fee. Firstly, it could be a bet that GBTC holders won\u2019t leave as the asset manager \u201canalyzed its holders\u2019 tax bill [...] And concluded they are \u2018stuck\u2019 as it is too costly to leave until they need the money.\u201d GBTC wields assets under management of nearly $24.7 billion as of March 25, per YCharts data. Bianco also believes Grayscale\u2019s firmness on its fees could result from optimism that Bitcoin\u2019s price \u201cwill moon well over $100k in the next year or two.\u201d \u201cUnder this scenario, [Grayscale] are betting the price of BTC will rise enough to increase their assets (for which they charge a fee) to \u201coffset\u201d most or all their outflows,\u201d Bianco wrote. If BTC falls, he added, \u201cthen this strategy could prove disastrous\u201d as GBTC selling could ramp up \u201cand \u2018stuck\u2019 tax bill holders find these bills shrink enough that they can leave and never return to GBTC again.\u201d \u201cExpect GBTC to be a constant selling source until it\u2019s held by dead people, those who forgot they owned it, or those \u201ctrapped\u201d with giant tax bills if they sell it.\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted in response to Bianco\u2019s theory that \u201cthere may never be an inflow to GBTC ever.\u201d \u201cMy guess is we see a few more big outflow days and then a slow trickle into eternity,\u201d Balchunas added. \u201cIf BTC price goes up [...] They\u2019ll be just fine revenue-wise.\u201d United States spot Bitcoin ETFs only came about due to Grayscale winning a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission last year which forced it to review Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert GBTC to an ETF. \u201cWhy did GBTC spend all the time and effort to sue the SEC to allow it to convert to an ETF and only manage it like this (so that it will slowly bleed out)?\u201d Bianco asked. Answering, Balchunas speculated that Grayscale maybe knew that even if GBTC were to \u201cbleed out every last investor,\u201d the ETF hype would \u201cpump BTC enough\u201d to offset the losses, and its assets under management would remain stable. Related: BlackRock\u2019s ETF could flip GBTC in Bitcoin holdings within 3 weeks Grayscale had also long said it would convert GBTC, so it \u201chad to follow through\u201d and didn\u2019t lower fees as it\u2019s \u201cTOUGH to kill 80% of your revenue stream in one shot,\u201d Balchunas added. Grayscale likely \u201cunderestimated just how brutally competitive\u201d the U.S. ETF market is, Balchunas said, and maybe wasn\u2019t expecting the cutthroat fee war issuers started in a bid to gain market share. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart postulated another reason could be that Grayscale was acting to try to help bankrupt crypto lender Genesis \u2014 both are subsidiaries of crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis had over 62 million GBTC shares used to collateralize loans made by Gemini Earn users and the two companies were in a long legal fight over them. \u201cThere was 100% a selfish interest in just being able to get out of those positions at [net asset value],\u201d said Seyffart.

First launched in February 2021, the Pixelmon project became an instant sensation for all the wrong reasons, explained the project\u2019s now-CEO Giulio Xiloyannis in an interview with Cointelegraph. The project was launched on Feb. 25 by a 19-year-old developer who promised to deliver a Pokemon-esque game where people could collect, trade, train and battle monsters called Pixelmon. However, the project became the laughingstock of the crypto world after raising $70 million in Ether (ETH) at the time, only to reveal 68 \u201cquestionable\u201d NFT characters upon launch, including \u201cKevin\u201d \u2014 an awkward-looking character that became the mascot of what was later dubbed the \u201cworst NFT project ever.\u201d Xiloyannis said when he swooped in to acquire the Pixelmon project in May 2022, he knew immediately that all of the artwork would need to be redone if the team were to revive the project and make something of it for its community. The only NFT that wouldn\u2019t be revamped was Kevin, which Xiloyannis described as a symbol of crypto's resilience and something that should never be altered. \u201cYes he\u2019s a funny meme, but he's the symbol that nothing ever dies in blockchain \u2014 that there is this resilience in the industry. That\u2019s why we kept him as a symbol and that\u2019s why we keep nurturing him.\u201d Xiloyannis is aware of how the term \u201cfractionalized NFT IP\u201d could be confusing to many but says the reality of it is relatively simple once it\u2019s broken down. He pointed to Pokemon as an example of how Pixelmon fits into the seemingly complex cross-section of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and intellectual property rights. \u201cImagine if Nintendo had minted 100 NFTs of Pikachu in the 90s, and by owning one of them, you had a 1% right to royalties from Pikachu\u2019s usage,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time it gets used on a shirt, on a mug, or a purchase of a skin in-game, you receive royalties on-chain paid to your account equal to 1% of the total royalties of Pikachu.\u201d Unlike other NFT-based blockchain games, which use NFTs to enforce \u201cgated\u201d access to the game, the soon-to-be-released Pixelmon will be completely free to play, something that Xiloyannis believes holds the key to real adoption among blockchain-based games. By owning a Pixelmon NFT, holders are entitled to royalties whenever the monster\u2019s likeness is used outside of the game, much in a similar way to how royalties would be paid to the owner of a hypothetical Pikachu NFT every time it was emblazoned on a piece of merch or appeared in another show or game. The owners of Pixelmon NFTs are paid out in the form of the MON Protocols\u2019 native MON token, which recently conducted a token pre-sale for holders and distributed select amounts of MON to holders based on the rarity of their respective NFTs. While Xiloyannis said he \u201cobviously\u201d believes in the fractionalized IP model, he explained some of the potential risks that could come along with it for holders. Outside of the worst-case scenario \u2014 where the game simply doesn\u2019t pick up any traction and NFT holders aren\u2019t sufficiently reimbursed for their initial investment \u2014 Xiloyannis says the main concer lies in the distribution of attention. \u201cFractionalized IP ownership is ultimately a very, very subjective bet on which character is going to get love. You could end up purchasing an asset that gets used a lot in-game, but nobody spends money on outside of the game,\u201d he explained. Ironically, Xiloyannis explained this is one of the reasons that the infamous \u201cKevin\u201d could become one of the most sought-after NFTs in the collection, as holders try to make a bet on which character will be the most used. In the last month, several of the 119 available \u201cOG Kevin\u201d NFTs have sold for over 4 ETH (roughly $14,000). However, Xiloyannis warned that trying to pick the right monster could be like buying the NFT of an unpopular Pokemon before the game launches, only to later realize you didn\u2019t select the right one. Related: Web3 games must be \u2018fun and engaging\u2019 to be sustainable \u2014 OKX exec \u201cThere's the risk is that you have a very skewed set of holdings where you have essentially a curve where the top of the curve is super happy because they bet on the right character, but the tail would be very unhappy,\u201d he said. The second-biggest risk Xiloyannis says, is the structure of the Pixelmon company itself. Built on a decentralized model of governance, Pixelmon \u2014 which is the perpetual licensee of all the IP rights \u2014 vets all licensing agreements through its community of holders. \u201cImagine a paradox scenario. Disney wants to put one of our characters inside the next Frozen movie and yet for some weird reason, our holders vote no. So there is some business risk there. And that business risk is essentially the biggest risk.\u201d \u201cIn the end, we were convinced that letting early fans \u2014 the people who know what really made this great \u2014 control where this goes is probably better for the longevity of an IP than, you know, like, letting Netflix destroy The Witcher,\u201d he added. Xiloyannis added that the community of Mon Protocol had grown significantly over the last eighteen months, currently boasting over 1.12 million wallets in March 2023. The monster-battling element of the game \u201cBattle Arena\u201d is slated for launch later this year, while the open-world role-playing segment \u201cHunting Grounds\u201d is set to be released in 2025. Several crypto firms are looking to Pixelmon with growing optimism. On March 19, Blockchain game publisher Immutable launched a $100 million fund, choosing to allocate a significant portion of that capital to Pixelmon. Additionally, on Feb. 1, Pixelmon raised $8 million in a seed investment round, including firms such as Animoca Brands and Delphi Ventures.

Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently shared concern over a \u201clack of engagement\u201d from the SEC, and have since reduced their odds for an approved spot Ether in May to 25%. In a March 25 post on X, Balchunas said it was a \u201cpessimistic 25%,\" adding the lack of engagement seems to be \u201cpurposeful\u201d as opposed to \u201cprocrastination.\u201d Related: Pundits worry SEC\u2019s Ethereum probe could be used to hold back ETFs However, Salm said the recent approval of Ether Futures ETFs and regulation of those products as commodity futures put the spot Ether ETFs in a strong position to be approved as futures and spot products have a \u201chigh correlation.\u201d A similar conclusion was reached by Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal and Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week. BlackRock, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex are among the spot Ether ETF applicants vying for SEC approval. The SEC must decide on VanEck\u2019s application by May 23 and analysts predict all applicants will learn their fate on that date. Magazine: \u2018Am I sorry?

The project looked at four use cases, not all of which involved CBDC, according to the report it released on the test results. It experimented with digital trading with atomic (instantaneous) settlement using smart contracts. It connected tokenization platforms to facilitate atomic delivery versus payment and worked with financial infrastructure firm CLS Group to show the connector\u2019s capability of connecting existing foreign exchange infrastructures using CBDC. The fourth use case, involving using its Liquidity Saving Mechanism algorithms to reduce fragmentation of liquidity across platforms, was described as a \u201cpaper exercise, accompanied by bilateral discussions.\u201d The project used R3\u2019s Corda and the Hyperledger Fabric and Besu blockchains to demonstrate the connector's interoperability among them. It concluded: \u201cA single point of access provided by Swift can enable institutions to reuse their existing channels, reach new networks, and bring down participation costs.\u201d SWIFT also emphasized that traditional financial solutions will continue to exist and demand interconnectivity as well. With the completion of the sandbox experiments, SWIFT plans to further develop the beta version of its connector, concentrating on the implementation of smart contracts across networks, cryptographically locking and releasing tokens across networks and preserving data and programmability of tokens across networks.

Data from blockchain analytics platform Artemis reveals that Solana\u2019s weekly transfer volume for stablecoins reached $364.7 billion, overtaking the Ethereum network, which reported $152.99 billion. Other top chains like Tron and BNB Chain saw volumes of $101.57 billion and $22.75 billion, respectively. The figure adds to the total stablecoin transfer volume for March, which currently stands at $804 billion, almost eclipsing the $960 billion in Solana stablecoin transfer volume for February. Moreover, March\u2019s $804 billion to date is 3,410% more than the $11.56 billion stablecoin transfer volume in March 2023. Solana currently accounts for 42.3% of stablecoin market share, which is a significant increase from the 1.9% share it held a year ago. Stablecoin activity on Solana started picking up in October 2023 and has steadily increased by 1,770% since then. Ethereum, which has always been an industry leader for stablecoin transfer volume, has trailed Solana since the beginning of the year. The layer 1 blockchain had a market share of more than 31% in December 2023 but has since lost its dominance to Solana, currently accounting for about 27% of the stablecoin transfer volume. The third-largest blockchain for stablecoin transfers is Tron, with $ 101.57 billion over the last week and $366.5 billion so far in March. Related: Base TVL doubles in a month as pundits tip memecoins to drive adoption In addition to stablecoin volumes, there has been an uptick in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Solana, pushing its total value locked to $4.55 billion, its highest level since April 2022, according to data from DefiLlama. This has also been evidenced by the increased decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, where Solana surpassed Ethereum and other chains on March 19. Trading in Solana-based DEXs increased by 70% during the week, running up to Mach 19 to $3.37 billion. Volume on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges rose a mere 0.63% to $3.05 billion over the same period. There are 26 DEXs on Solana, according to data from Alchemy. Orca is the largest DEX on Solaba, accounting for 88% of the total volume. This performance in the Solana network has been fueled by growing interest in memecoins within the ecosystem led by Book of Meme (BOME), Dogwifwhat (WIF), BONK and Slerf.

A total of $888 million was withdrawn from the spot ETFs, marking a significant shift from the previous week's $2.57 billion inflow. This has led to speculation about the sustainability of Bitcoin's rally to $70,000 on March 25. Some market participants had argued that institutional inflows were a key driver behind Bitcoin's all-time high of $73,755 on March 14, casting doubt on the 9% gains seen between March 23 and March 25. Further raising concerns is the fact that this rally occurred while the S&P 500 index was unable to maintain its all-time high of 5,260 set on March 21. Analyst venturefoundŒûr, on March 20, suggested that Bitcoin was facing a reality check after FOMO from ETF investors drove it to a new high before the halving, effectively \"trapping\" those who bought at the peak. While a 15% gain from March 20 to March 25 shouldn't dismiss bearish concerns outright, Bitcoin's market behavior suggests that its bullish momentum isn't solely reliant on spot ETF inflows. Some traders believe that the recent approval of a $1.2 trillion spending package by the United States on March 23 serves as a key positive catalyst for Bitcoin. This is particularly true in light of the U.S. Federal Reserve's forecast model predicting three interest rate cuts throughout 2024. With the U.S. deficit expected to reach $1.6 trillion in 2024, the pressure on government debt repayment intensifies as interest rates hover above 5.25%. The concurrent rise to all-time highs of scarce assets like gold, Bitcoin, real estate, and the stock market suggests a weakening U.S. dollar. Ultimately, the performance of the North American currency against the euro and the British pound is less relevant as investors seek refuge from fiat currency devaluation. Concluding that Bitcoin's price will continue its upward trajectory due to monetary expansion might seem premature. However, bears arguing that the U.S. fiscal trajectory will lead to a recession\u2014which could negatively affect risk-on assets\u2014miss a crucial point: Bitcoin's price has already surged 64% year-to-date in 2024, leaving those waiting for a dip behind. To gauge whether professional traders have become more pessimistic about Bitcoin following the disappointing spot ETF inflow data, one should examine the BTC monthly futures contracts. In neutral markets, these contracts typically command a premium of 5% to 10%, accounting for their longer settlement period. Data indicates that the annualized BTC futures premium was largely unaffected by the net spot ETF outflows. Currently, an 18% level is viewed as optimistic, suggesting buyers are willing to pay a premium to open leveraged long positions. Related: Bitcoin ETFs could soften BTC price retracement before the halving Examining the Bitcoin options market is crucial to determine if the March rally to $70,000 has increased the demand for strategies to hedge against potential price corrections. Typically, if traders expect a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will exceed 7%, whereas periods of enthusiasm often show a skew below 7%. Since March 13, the BTC options 25% delta skew has remained in a neutral range, indicating a balanced demand for bullish and bearish options strategies. Notably, there were no signs of panic as Bitcoin tested the $62,000 support on March 20. The indicators from Bitcoin derivatives markets suggest a strong price resilience despite the recent spot ETF outflows, supporting the likelihood that the $70,000 support level is gaining strength.

In a suit filed on March 25, the plaintiffs also asked the court for clarification of the limits of the SEC\u2019s authority in light of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Beba created 100,000 BEBA tokens and has airdropped 60,880 of them so far, according to the suit. The tokens are intended to be freely traded and are expected to increase in value. The SEC \u201cwill take the position that BEBA tokens are investment contracts and that the airdrop is a securities transaction subject to registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933,\u201d it continued. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs argued that token recipients do nothing to become eligible for the airdrop or take actions that involve no \u201cmeaningful consideration, like \u2018following\u2019 Beba on social media.\u201d Therefore, there is no common enterprise in the airdrop.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows the BTC price climbed from an opening of $67,212 to an intra-day high of $70,306 on March 25. At the time of publication, BTC was trading at $70,268, up 7.5% over the last 24 hours. Bitcon\u2019s recovery follows a period of price downturn that has seen the cryptocurrency fall as low as $60,771, corroborated by negative ETF inflows. Could the surge in multiple BTC price metrics be a sign of things to come? Last week \u201cmarked the end of a 7-week cycle\u201d of inflows into crypto investment products as investors withdrew more than $942 million, according to a March 25 report by CoinShares. The report noted that last week marked the \u201cfirst outflow following a record 7-week run of inflows totaling US$12.3bn.\u201d The crypto asset management firm attributed the large outflows to the recent drawdown in crypto prices, which \u201cwiped US$10bn off total assets under management (AuM) but remain above prior cycle highs at US$88bn.\u201d CoinShares analyst James Butterfill said, \u201cWe believe the recent price correction led to hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US, which saw US$1.1bn inflows, partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale\u2019s significant US$2bn outflows last week.\u201d The poor sentiment was mostly focused on Bitcoin, which accounted for \u201c96% of the flows\u201d totaling $904 million, \u201dwhile short-bitcoin also saw minor outflows totaling US$3.7m.\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said that the large outflows witnessed by the spot Bitcoin ETFs last week were probably driven by bankrupt lender Genesis selling GBTC shares. Bitcoin has recently experienced a notable surge in its Age Consumed metric over the past few days. According to data from market intelligence firm Santiment, the number of dormant BTC addresses moving BTC surged to 162.89 million on March 23, the highest in over two years. Age Consumed is a metric that tracks the movement of previously idle BTC coins. The metric shows the number of BTC changing addresses daily multiplied by the number of days since they moved. Spikes signal a potential increase in price volatility. This spike in Age Consumed suggests that previously dormant addresses holding Bitcoin are now re-entering circulation, indicating a revival in network activity. This was evidenced by a surge in transaction volume, as shown in the in chart below. As Bitcoin\u2019s Age Consumed metric grows, transaction volume increases, a precursor to potential price jumps in the BTC price.

As such, a number of large-cap altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last week. They were led by BNB Chains\u2019 BNB, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Toncoin (TON, which have produced 7%, 20% and 46% gains in the last seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Though it won\u2019t be the first such halving event, the crypto world is poised to enter the unknown, as recent all-time highs in price and a somewhat crowded mining landscape bring mystery and suspense to what could become one of the most important days in cryptocurrency history. The months leading up to the halving have seen the approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States as well as a new all-time-high Bitcoin (BTC) price of $73,679 set on March 13, 2024. Whether the price will deflate, rocket or maintain after the April halving event is anyone\u2019s guess \u2014 there are no guarantees. But if the past is any indicator of the future, previous halving events can be studied to get an idea of how this year\u2019s could play out. Bitcoin block number one was mined with a reward of 50 BTC on Jan. 3, 2009. The first halving event occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, and reduced that reward to 25 BTC per block. At the time, BTC was sitting at $12.20. Quick fact: If one had spent $100 on BTC the day of the first halving, they'd have snagged 8.9 BTC. Then, if they had managed to hold their coins until March 13, 2024, when BTC reached its most recent all-time high, the $100 investment would have been worth $655,743. After the first halving, the price of BTC shot up from $12.20 to around $1,000 by the end of 2023. The second halving event happened on July 9, 2016. This brought the reward for mining a single block to 12.5 BTC. At the time, Bitcoin was valued at around $640. By July 2017, it had risen to $2,550. May 11, 2020, brought the third and most recent halving event. Bitcoin mining rewards were reduced to 6.25 BTC per block and traded for about $8,750 at the time. Within a year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of approximately $62,000. With this year\u2019s halving set to happen in mid-April, both the price of BTC and speculation surrounding the event have reached all-time highs. Analysts are predicting everything from around $75,000 just after the halving occurs to $250,000 or more within about a year of the halving. As history has shown, the price of BTC has typically skyrocketed over the next year after halving events, but some drawbacks and recessions have occurred in the months between the date of the halving and upward momentum. It\u2019s important to note that predictions concerning market movements are just that \u2014 predictions. Nobody knows for sure whether Bitcoin will fall, moon or stabilize after the halving. However, history has seemingly favored the bold, with all-time highs tending to follow halving events. Aside from concerns over price, there are unanswered questions surrounding network security in the post-halving world. At the far end of the spectrum, there are potential security risks involved in the halving due to the potential for smaller miners to be forced out of the scene. With rewards slated to be reduced by 50%, those miners operating at the edge of profitability/loss could find themselves staked out of the rewards spectrum and seeking a sell-off or unaided exit. It\u2019s possible a transient flux of mining availability could cause ripples throughout the Bitcoin network that reduce hash rates and lower overall security. However, on the other end of the spectrum, previous halving events have had almost no discernible effect on overall network security, and many analysts are predicting smooth sailing for the network itself.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Business, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving"},{"date":"Mar 25, 2024","summary":"","author":"Rakesh Upadhyay","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/price-analysis-3-25-spx-dxy-btc-eth-bnb-sol-xrp-doge-ada-avax","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Price analysis 3/25: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, AVAX","type":"Blog","category":"Price Analysis","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week positively and is trying to maintain above the $70,000 level. Analysts are hopeful of a reversal this week following five successive days of negative inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week. Goldman Sachs said its clients are showing a strong appetite for the firm\u2019s future and options offerings. Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, said the firm\u2019s larger clients were showing greater interest in the crypto sector following the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. The demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is likely to remain strong barring a sharp fall in Bitcoin. That could keep the retracements shallow as market participants will jump in to buy the dips. What are the key resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out. The S&P 500 Index continues to rise inside the ascending channel pattern, indicating that the buyers remain in command. The up move is likely to face selling at the channel\u2019s resistance line. If the price turns down from the resistance line, the index could extend its stay inside the channel. The bullish momentum could pick up on a break above the channel, and the index could soar to 5,450. Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average (5,147), it will indicate that the bulls are rushing the exit. That may accelerate selling and tug the price down to the 50-day simple moving average (5,018). The negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) warns of a possible correction in the near term. The bears pulled the U.S. dollar Index (DXY) below the 20-day EMA ($103) on March 20 but could not sustain the lower levels. The index turned up sharply on March 21 and climbed back above the moving averages, indicating aggressive buying at lower levels. The index could rise toward the solid overhead resistance at 105. If the price turns down from this level, the index may remain range-bound between 102.50 and 105 for some more time. On the contrary, if buyers drive the price above 105, it could start a trending move toward 107. There is a minor resistance at 106, but it is likely to be crossed. Bitcoin broke out of the pennant formation of the past few days, signaling that the bulls have seized control. If the bulls maintain the price above $69,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to surge to the overhead resistance at $73,777. This level may act as a significant roadblock, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $80,000. Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The bears will try to sink the price below the pennant. If they do that, the pair could tumble to the 50-day SMA ($59,018). Ether (ETH) has broken out of the 20-day EMA ($3,521) on March 25, indicating that the bulls have asserted their supremacy. If buyers maintain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The ETH/USDT pair could rise to $3,679 and thereafter rally to the overhead resistance at $4,094. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from $3,679 and plunges below the 50-day SMA. That could indicate the start of a deeper correction to $3,056 and then $2,868. BNB\u2019s (BNB) relief rally has risen above the overhead resistance at $590, an important level to watch out for. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $590, the BNB/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and jump to $645. This level may pose a strong challenge, but if overcome, the next stop may be $692. If bears want to prevent the up move, they will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA ($534). If they do that, the pair may drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $500. Solana (SOL) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($168) on March 24, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will try to push the SOL/USDT pair to the formidable resistance at $205. If the price turns down from $205, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA and remain between these two levels for a few days. A break and close above $205 will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could rise to $243 and eventually to $260. The strong support on the downside is the 20-day EMA, below which the pair could reach the 50-day SMA ($134). XRP (XRP) has been hovering around the 20-day EMA ($0.62) for the past few days, indicating a tussle between the buyers and sellers. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. The XRP/USDT pair could swing between the uptrend line and $0.67 for a while. If bulls propel the price above $0.67, the pair could rally to the overhead obstacle at $0.74. The bears are expected to fiercely defend this level. On the downside, a drop below the uptrend will put the bears in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair could then collapse to $0.52. Related: BTC price battles for key $69K as Bitcoin nears short liquidation zone Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) relief rally has reached the stiff resistance at $0.19, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. The 20-day EMA ($0.15) is sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. If buyers do not give up much ground from the current level, the likelihood of a rally above $0.19 increases. The DOGE/USDT pair may jump to $0.23 and subsequently to $0.30. Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that the pair may continue its range-bound action between $0.12 and $0.19. Cardano\u2019s (ADA) recovery has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.66), a crucial resistance to keep an eye on. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that the bears continue to view the relief rallies as a selling opportunity. The ADA/USDT pair could then again drop to $0.57. If this support gives way, the pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. Conversely, if the price rises above $0.70, it will suggest that the bulls are back in the game. The pair will then attempt to climb to the overhead resistance at $0.81. If this level is scaled, the next stop is likely to be $0.92. Avalanche (AVAX) has stayed above the breakout level of $50 in the past few days, indicating solid demand from the bulls. Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in command. There is a minor hurdle at $58, but if it is crossed, the AVAX/USDT pair could retest the critical resistance at $65. The bears are likely to mount a strong defense at this level, but if overcome, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $87. If bears want to prevent the upside move, they will have to drag the price back below $50. That may accelerate selling and sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($44).

According to a March 25 Reuters report, SEC attorney Devon Staren said in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that Terra was a \u201chouse of cards\u201d that collapsed for investors in 2022. The civil trial kicked off more than a year after SEC officials filed a lawsuit against the blockchain firm in February 2023, alleging that Terra and its co-founder Do Kwon \u201corchestrat[ed] a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud.\u201d Kwon was not present on the first day of the trial. The Terraform Labs co-founder was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for using falsified travel documents and sentenced to four months in prison. Though he reportedly had been released on March 23 while awaiting extradition to either the U.S. or his native South Korea, no decision had been made at the time of publication. The SEC alleged Terra and Kwon misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD (UST), an algorithm stablecoin that depegged from the U.S. dollar. The impact on Terra (LUNA) and other tokens likely contributed to a significant crypto market downturn in 2022 in which several companies declared bankruptcy. Related: US Supreme Court case could change crypto industry regulation The trial was initially scheduled to begin in January. However, SEC officials joined with Kwon\u2019s legal team to push back the start date to March in anticipation of the Terraform Labs co-founder joining in his defense in person. In December 2023, Judge Jed Rakoff granted summary judgment in favor of the SEC over Terra dealing with unregistered securities and in favor of Kwon and the platform for the offer and sale of security-based swaps. Terraform\u2019s trial is one of many cases in the crypto space expected in court in 2024. On March 28, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will be sentenced following his conviction on seven felony charges.

The drop was fueled, in part, by outflows from the 11 new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin. A total of $836 million in funding left the funds between March 18-21, according to data compiled by Farside Investors. Are new investors getting cold feet? How likely are they to continue holding Bitcoin if the downward spiral continues? (It is, after all, the first time that Bitcoin hit a new historic high before \u2014 rather than after \u2014 its halving, scheduled to occur in April.) Related: Bitcoin maxis are about to kick off the altseason as BTC turns institutional We asked three investors for some analysis and tips for trading today\u2019s market. Since the ETFs launched, Bitcoin has been dancing to the equity markets beat. At specific moments in the day, liquidity surges and price action become inevitable. 4 p.m. in London, FX Fix: Cryptocurrency funding resets align perfectly here. 9:30 a.m. in New York: U.S. cash equity markets open, and the game begins. 5 p.m. London: European traders head home, while New York enjoys lunch. 4 p.m. in New York: U.S. cash equity markets close, creating another opportunity. These moments have been our golden hours for capturing big BTC moves and pocketing tidy profits. But beware: outside these windows, liquidity shrinks, and price swings turn ferocious. Being right pays off big, but a wrong move can be catastrophic. Tip: Ride the equity market\u2019s liquidity swells. My secret sauce? A lightning-fast momentum strategy. I buy weakness, sell strength, and keep tight stops. The result is that I've outperformed Bitcoin by 10% this month. The recent decline in ETF investment was likely due to the latest Federal Reserve (FOMC) meeting \u2014 markets and institutions tend to go risk-off before FOMC meetings. Additionally, the Bank of Japan has started increasing its interest rates, which hurt the risk on markets. That's normal. Ultimately, this event should not have any impact on the markets at all. Powell was dovish on the economy's outlook, through which risk-on assets quickly rallied back upwards. Finally, it shouldn't be the case that current ETF buyers are momentum-based. These first purchasers of the ETF are likely going to be long-time holders, but it could be that overall first-glimpse interest in the ETFs will decline over time the higher Bitcoin rises. That's entirely normal. Related: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs Tip: My advice would be to be counterintuitive: Buy Bitcoin dips when you can get in for a relatively low price. Use any Bitcoin price correction between 15-40% to accumulate for the next big bull cycle. I think people understand the volatility of digital assets thanks to past headlines. Anyone buying into ETFs is doing it for exposure to the asset class. Today\u2019s buyers would do well to be cognizant of separating the \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out) type of buying from long-term demand. Understand that volatility will continue in the near term, and ask yourself if you\u2019re buying into an ETF with plans to trade the volatility or if you\u2019re investing in the long-term narrative. If you\u2019re doing it for the former, get ready to actively focus on timing and momentum. If you\u2019re doing it for the latter, remember dollar-cost-averaging (DCAing) is your friend. Tip: I've been pretty actively placing \"stink bids\" for weeks like this in which we see \"wicky\" price action where dips are filled quickly. Given historical activity around the halving, the recent demand on the institutional side, and the retail demand for memecoins, it feels like there's a constant bid across all tokens from the majors to specific altcoin narratives. The market is in buy-the-dip mode and it feels like there needs to be some massive headwinds for a larger pullback to occur.

The upside move recovered the previous week\u2019s losses and has traders wondering if a new all-time high is in store.. Let\u2019s look into the reasons why Bitcoin price is up today. As Bitcoin price remains within striking distance of new all-time highs, investor sentiment has waivered as measured by the Market Prophit index. The sentiment decrease could be due to the record outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite a bevy of macro headwinds and over 31,000 BTC outflows from GBTC, Bitcoin price has quickly recovered. Even with the rapid Bitcoin price recovery, BTC continues to leave exchanges.

Despite these outflows, $1.1 billion of new spot Bitcoin ETF inflows were present for the week proceeding March 25. This marked the first time in 7-weeks that outflows were greater than inflows. According to CoinShares data, institutional investors pushed $12.3 billion into crypto year to date in 2024. For context, for the entire year of 2021, crypto products set a record with $10.6 billion in yearly inflows. Of the $12.3 billion pushed to crypto assets in 2024, over $11.9 billion has flowed to Bitcoin specifically. The total assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin dwarfs other digital assets, with $68.8 billion currently deployed.

The number of Bitcoin wallets holding non-zero amounts of BTC has remained above 51 million for the entirety of 2024. Not only are there more Bitcoin wallets than ever before, but because of consistent month-over-month price growth, on March 24, only 3% of wallets are at a loss.

Essentially a federation of independent platforms, the Fediverse allows users on different servers to communicate with one another. While pundits and analysts are still debating the reasons behind the move, Meta says it was in line with its commitment to decentralization and privacy. A claim that can be somewhat substantiated by the current business climate. Threads is Meta\u2019s answer to microblogging, a short-form media-sharing paradigm where users post and interact with easily digestible snippets of content. X is the undoubted leader in the space, with approximately 335 million monthly users in 2024. However, that number doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. When Elon Musk purchased X for $44 billion in October 2022, the social media site had approximately 368 million monthly users. That indicates a decline of 33 million users, or about 10% of the total user count. Much of this has been attributed to churn over the perceived polarization of X via Musk\u2019s increased presence. Millions of people celebrated the purchase as, in their view, a win for so-called \u201cinternet free speech,\u201d while others fled X over what they considered a right wing takeover of the world\u2019s most popular microblogging platform. Many of those who fled the site propped up decentralized offerings in the Fediverse \u2014 such as Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey \u2014 as destinations for those fleeing Twitter and its new management. As it stands, X remains the most popular microblogging site by a far stretch, but it also exists in a state of evident decline. Both revenues and user counts are down year over year since Musk\u2019s takeover. Although user count did see a brief bump in 2023, the subsequent decline has wiped out those gains. Threads, on the other hand, seemingly has nowhere to go but up. It currently has about 130 million active monthly users. Meta\u2019s latest announcement that Threads and Instagram would both be joining the Fediverse could be seen as a move to counter Musk and X\u2019s continuing trend towards centralization. Musk, the world\u2019s richest (or second richest, depending on any given day\u2019s market movement) person, has often stated that his intent with X was to build an \u201ceverything app\u201d where users would communicate, monetize media, conduct financial transactions, and host their personal and professional brands. The Fediverse, on the other hand, is a suite of decentralized protocols allowing native third-party integration and, as Meta pointed out in its recent blog post, giving users control over their data: \u201cOne way to think about the fediverse is to compare it to email. You can send an email from a Gmail account to a Yahoo account, for example, because those services support the same protocols. Similarly, in the fediverse you can connect with people who use different social networking services that are built on the same protocol, removing the silos that confine people and their followers to any single platform. But unlike email, your fediverse conversations and profile are public and can be shared across servers.\u201d As users continue to trickle away from Musk\u2019s centralized Big Tech offering, the X \u201ceverything app,\u201d decentralized offerings such as Mastodon offer a different lease on the idea of microblogging. And, arguably, the addition of Threads and Instagram brings with it a potential level of user activity previously unseen in the Fediverse.

The new protocol will use the dollar-based TRI token backed by collateral assets to make it easier for users to acquire leverage and hedge risks. The interest-bearing tfBILL, a tokenized short-term United States Treasury bill product, will be the first collateral asset used to back TRI. Other TrueFi pools, RWA from different protocols and other crypto-native assets could also be used. A user could mint TRI on Trinity using tfBill or other assets as collateral and swap it for a stablecoin on an automated market maker. The user could then mint TRI through a smart contract it calls a vessel, borrow up to 92% of the loan-to-value ratio in TRI, swap that for the stablecoin again, mint more TRI and repeat the process. Eventually, the process would allow the user to earn up to 15\u201320% net yield. Alternatively, a user could swap stablecoin for TRI and stake it in the sTRI vault, earning fees for a yield \u201cexpected to be near or above T-bill rates.\u201d TRI could also be traded on secondary markets.

This time, market observers are asking whether this part of the halving \u2014 which in previous years saw double-digit percentage losses \u2014 will be softened by the presence of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have the potential to bring large amounts of institutional investment into BTC. The 2024 Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April and will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin\u2019s history. Halvings decrease the supply of new BTC, ensuring its scarcity. According to crypto analysis firm Rekt Capital, the first stage is called the pre-halving downside phase, which sees bearish price movements due to investors anticipating the event. The second stage \u2014 the pre-halving rally \u2014 records significant price increases due to moves by short-term investors who want to reap the benefits of the halving hype. At the time of writing, many market observers believe Bitcoin has entered the third stage: a pre-halving retracement. This phase records downward price movements mainly due to investors anticipating incoming sell pressure and exiting their positions \u2014 and this is where investors expect Bitcoin ETFs to play a crucial role. The fourth stage, reaccumulation, starts after the halving takes place and may last up to five months. At this point, most hype is lost, and many investors exit their positions as they get bored due to stagnant price movements. However, at the end of this reaccumulation phase comes the fifth stage of halving: the parabolic uptrend. This is where the Bitcoin price can recover from the third and fourth stages and hit a new all-time high (ATH). In early January, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs to be listed and traded on registered traditional exchanges. This landmark decision allowed skeptical traditional investors to include Bitcoin among their assets, increasing demand for the flagship crypto. Recent data shows that the demand for Bitcoin ETFs is too substantial to be ignored. On March 4, global Bitcoin exchange-traded products (including Bitcoin ETFs) surpassed 1 million Bitcoin in assets under management. On March 5, Bitcoin ETF products broke a new record, reaching a cumulative $10 billion in trading volume, which marked the highest level since their inception in January. Considering that these surges were recorded while gold and other ETF products recorded significant outflows, could this suggest a potential investment shift toward Bitcoin ETFs? Recent: Ethereum Dencun upgrade lowers transaction fees for L2s Such an increase in demand for Bitcoin from traditional investors is not something the market has witnessed before. According to bullish market observers, the inflows through Bitcoin ETFs will be a hedge against falling prices during the retracement. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor recently said, \u201cThe approval of spot ETFs is going to be a major catalyst that\u2019s going to drive the demand shock, and then that will be followed in April with a supply shock.\u201d The connection between Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin halving will appear in the third and fourth stages of the halving process. The third and fourth stages of the halving usually record falling Bitcoin prices, as mentioned above. This happens as the investors who opened shorts to ride the halving hype exit their positions. Miners who anticipate this retreat also sell their Bitcoin holdings before their rewards are cut in half to maintain some liquidity. After these players leave the market, new investors who bought in for the hype get disappointed and leave their positions. All these factors mean one thing only: falling demand. However, the halving phases are not the only things that can trigger a price dump. During the first week of March, the Bitcoin price fell after a whale sold 1,000 Bitcoin all at once. Data showed that this wallet had been holding Bitcoin since 2010, and the sudden exit triggered an overall decline in Bitcoin prices. Institutional activity, particularly within Bitcoin ETFs, played a significant role in shaping market dynamics. Accounting for billions of dollars in trading volume, the ETFs successfully influenced the market sentiment toward a positive trajectory. Assuming that the exponential growth of Bitcoin ETFs continues, data reported by Blockworks suggests that by the time the third and fourth stages of the halving arrive, the inflows through Bitcoin ETFs could create enough force to combat the falling prices, which, in turn, would provide a stronger base for the parabolic uptrend and result in even higher ATHs at the fifth stage. Mario Nawfal, the host of The Roundtable Show on X, told Cointelegraph, \u201cThe expected halving retracement is becoming a very consensus view, no different to the \u2018sell on the news\u2019 consensus we experienced when the ETFs were first approved by the SEC. Thus, when we got the news and correction, as the thesis was so consensus, the dip was shallow and short-lived.\u201d \u201cThe real story going forward is actually the huge imbalance we see between the supply of BTC and structural inflows that our sources indicate are being planned, with institutions, family offices, and endowments and foundations having not yet concluded their rebalancings and asset allocation into BTC or crypto assets generally. The real story will be the lack of supply to handle the inflows and the disruption that comes with it,\u201d he said. On the other hand, some experts are not confident that the inflows through Bitcoin ETFs can provide the aforementioned once-in-a-lifetime opportunity during the 2024 halving. Nicholas Sciberras, a senior analyst from Collective Shift, argues that while Bitcoin EFTs could pull in enough inflow to hedge against the selling pressure, they could also contribute to the selling pressure if the demand for Bitcoin ETFs doesn\u2019t continue as positively as it is today. Therefore, instead of balancing out the decreases expected in the third and fourth stages of halving, they can amplify it. JPMorgan\u2019s prediction for the bearish scenario also argues that Bitcoin could fall as low as $42,000 after the halving. The bank expects the prices to follow the usual halving sequences and critically fall after the halving hype is over. For instance, since its launch in January, Grayscale Investments has been experiencing considerable outflows from its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF. The sell-offs amounted to billions of dollars in January alone. This could point to investors\u2019 decreasing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, or it could simply be associated with Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, showing that it might not meet the expectations or needs of investors. Recent: Greens\u2019 push to end German cryptocurrency tax exemption sparks debate If it\u2019s the former, then by the time the third and fourth stages of the halving arrive, inflows to spot BTC ETFs might decrease, thereby not affecting the expected price drops of the halving. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told Cointelegraph, \u201cYou may argue that the ETF buyers aren\u2019t even that into the mission of Bitcoin. But, as I\u2019ve told many people, don\u2019t underestimate their ability to hold on because most of them are going to have a 60/40 core and guardian, kinda low-cost indexing. Plus, because they\u2019ve got all the serious stuff covered there, they\u2019re going to have more tolerance for the hot sauce. So, no matter how high or low it goes, I just don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that much. I think the ETF holders will be stronger than people think.\u201d Most would say that it\u2019s not possible to be 100% certain about something in the crypto market. While Sciberras\u2019s scenario is possible, there is less than a month to the halving, and judging by the performance of the Bitcoin ETFs, the bearish scenario seems unlikely. Nevertheless, while most of the community expects Bitcoin ETFs to benefit from some of the halving stages, only time will tell to what extent it will affect them, if at all.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #ETF, #Adoption, #Tokens, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #Trading"},{"date":"Mar 25, 2024","summary":"","author":"Savannah Fortis","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/avalanche-chainlink-collaborate-on-chain-asset-settlement","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Avalanche and Chainlink collaborate on Australasian on-chain asset settlement","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Chainlink Labs have released the results of a recent collaboration that aimed to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum blockchain networks for on-chain settlement solutions. ANZ used an interoperability solution provided by Chainlink called the cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP), which allowed it to demonstrate how clients will be able to access, trade, and seamlessly settle tokenized assets across networks in different currencies. Through CCIP ANZ simulated the purchase of tokenized assets on the Ethereum network at a price denominated in one stablecoin, with transaction initiation and settlement occurring on Avalanche in another stablecoin. Central to this initiative is the concept of \u201cDelivery vs. Payment (DvP)\u201d \u2014 a standard settlement protocol for securities transactions. By tokenizing assets and payments on the same blockchain infrastructure, ANZ could potentially modernize traditional DvP processes, and ensure an atomic, non-intermediated settlement. Lee Ross, the technology domain lead at ANZ, commented on the collaboration saying: \"Chainlink\u2019s CCIP played a key role in abstracting away the blockchain complexity of moving tokenized assets across different chains and ensuring atomic cross-chain DvP.\u201d This specific simulation had an ANZ customer using the bank\u2019s digital asset services (DAS) portal to obtain a tokenized ANZ-issued New Zealand dollar stablecoin (NZ$DC) via Avalanche. On the Ethereum network, it then purchased tokenized Australian nature-based assets issued as NFTs and denominated in tokenized ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoins (A$DC) According to the announcement, ANZ used its own Avalanche Evergreen Subnet for its Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) compatibility, permissioning and customized gas token. Related: Former Blockchain Global director restricted from leaving Australia Anurag Soin, the product lead of digital added services at ANZ said: \u201cWe look forward to continuing to test how blockchain, smart contracts, and tokenization can improve the rails of the global financial system.\" ANZ's collaboration with Chainlink and Avalanche highlights the continuing convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) within the tokenized asset ecosystem. It provides banking services to more than 8.5 million retail and institutional customers across nearly 30 markets. As the project progresses, ANZ said it aims to deploy the solution on blockchain mainnets, pushing for a new era of blockchain-enabled asset settlement in the financial services industry. In February, the American investment bank and financial services provider Citigroup partnered with Ava Labs -\u2014the developer of the Avalanche network \u2014 to complete a proof-of-concept for tokenizing private equity funds via the Avalanche blockchain.

As previously reported, Binance hinted at exiting Russia in early September 2023 as top local executives including vice president of Eastern Europe Gleb Kostarev stepped down. A few weeks later, Binance claimed it sold its entire Russian business to the newly created exchange CommEx, but it declined to disclose any details about CommEx founders or executives. Subsequently, CommEx emphasized that it operated independently of Binance, but admitted that some of its core members were former Binance staf. The mysterious deal quickly sparked chatter among local crypto enthusiasts, who saw lots of similarities between Binance and CommEx websites, calling the new exchange a \u201cRussian version\u201d of Binance.US. At the time of the sale, Russia was the top market in terms of user visits on Binance.com, accounting for 6.9% of total visits.

Pseudonymous crypto investor Orlando took to X to voice his concerns in a March 23 post: \u201cLike everyone else, I\u2019m disappointed with how the DED situation unfolded. The treasury spent money, and many people recently bought and held DOT, driven by the excitement around this experimental DED memecoin.

Circle\u2019s decision to discontinue support for USDC on Tron had a domino effect, as Binance \u2014 the crypto exchange with the highest trading volume \u2014 followed suit. On March 25, Binance announced its decision to cease support for Tron\u2019s TRC-20-based USDC deposits and withdrawals from April 5. Crypto investors using Binance have been given 12 days to convert, transfer or cash out their TRC-20 USDC tokens from Binance.

A Binance executive detained by the Nigerian authorities has reportedly escaped detention using a fake passport, according to reports in a local publication citing sources familiar with the matter. The news comes as other reports claim the Nigerian government has launched criminal proceedings against the exchange for tax evasion. According to local media, the charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday. Binance executive Nadeem Anjarwalla and his colleague Tigran Gambaryan have been detained in a guest house for several weeks in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. However, Anjarwalla reportedly fled detention on Friday, March 22, after he was taken to a nearby mosque for prayers. Anjarwalla reportedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East airline. However, it is unclear how he managed to board the international flight, as his British passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remains in the custody of the Nigerian authorities. According to an immigration official, the Binance executive fled Nigeria on a Kenyan passport, and authorities are now trying to determine how Anjarwalla acquired the passport, as he had no other travel documents while in custody. According to reports, the men were granted several privileges while in detention, including using cell phones. Anjarwalla, the regional manager for Binance in Africa, and Gambaryan, a United States citizen who is the head of Binance\u2019s criminal investigations team, were taken into custody upon their arrival in Nigeria on Feb. 26. \"We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue,\" a Binance Spokesperson told Cointelegraph. The men were detained after a magistrate court in Abuja received a criminal complaint against them.

In January 2022, Sultan Gustaf Al Ghozali minted NFTs with photos of himself that he took every day for five years. The collection, called \u201cGhozali Everyday,\u201d gained support from crypto community members, netting Ghozali, who was still a student, over $1 million. When Ghozali graduated from college in 2023, he posted on X that he would finally stop taking selfies. He said he was lucky to have made money from the \u201cstupidest idea\u201d he came up with. After disappearing from X for months, Ghozali reappeared as interest in memecoins surged. On March 24, he announced the second iteration of Ghozali Everyday \u2014 a memecoin and NFT hybrid project on the Base blockchain. Since its launch, Ghozali\u2019s presale has surpassed its 400 Ether (ETH) cap. At the time of writing, the presale address reached 527 ETH, around $1.8 million. However, Ghozali wrote on X that he would refund those who sent more ETH after the cap was reached. Amid the Bitcoin (BTC) uptick, interest in memecoins has resurfaced, driven mainly by Solana traders. Data showed that presale projects on Solana raised $100 million in just three days from March 15 to 18. Community members described the Solana memecoin frenzy as \u201cpeak degeneracy,\u201d with users blindly sending Solana (SOL) tokens to founders announcing \u201cpresales\u201d without any guarantee that they would get any tokens back.

BTC price action is displaying renewed energy as the market consolidates higher \u2014 can bulls manage a return to price discovery? That is the best scenario on the table for the monthly close. Bitcoin\u2019s hardwon comeback contrasts with last week\u2019s grim mood, which witnessed precipitous losses. The retracement from current all-time highs near $74,000 at one point passed 17%, and while still modest by bull market correction standards, it made many nervous. This week, the landscape is different \u2014 at least so far. A CME gap to the upside has become one to the downside, and investor anticipation of a fresh attack on the highs to come is climbing, not falling. Combine that with an inbound mining difficulty increase and classic bullish signals are plain to see. Beyond Bitcoin, a classic set of macroeconomic triggers is waiting in the wings to potentially inject some added volatility into risk assets. Cointelegraph takes a closer look at these issues and more in the weekly rundown of near-term BTC price catalysts. In strong contrast to before, the weekend was mostly a success story for Bitcoin bulls. A slow grind higher culminated in a weekly close of just under $67,200 on Bitstamp, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms. While this is, in fact, $1,200 lower than the previous week, it canceled out the majority of recent losses, which saw BTC/USD reach local lows of less than $61,000 on March 20. Now, a gap to the downside on CME futures markets is the target to watch for popular analyst Mark Cullen. When they appear over a weekend, gaps either up or down form a common price lure, with BTC/USD \u201cfilling\u201d them within days or even hours when the new trading week begins. \u201cLets see if that CME gap gets filled in the next 24hrs,\u201d Cullen wrote in part of a post on X, adding a chart showing what he described as \u201careas of interest.\u201d A look at market participants\u2019 views prior to the Wall Street opening nonetheless reveals strong reservations about the strength of the Bitcoin bull market. Fellow trader JT outlined a range of oscillators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), all calling for a trend reversal, with \u201coverbought\u201d signals present on two-week timeframes. \u201cBottom line: Bitcoin is overbought on the 2-week oscillators and would need a close over $69.1K for bulls to regain momentum,\u201d part of a recent X commentary reads. Prior to the weekly close, however, trader Alan Tardigrade saw a different narrative present on daily RSI data. The metric, he suggested, was breaking out of a downtrend in place for much of March. \u201c$BTC is ready for the next week Pump,\u201d he summarized. Analyst Kevin Svenson drew similar tentative conclusions based on another indicator, the daily Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). Closely tied to the spot price narrative is the United States-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These saw something of an anomaly last week, clocking five consecutive days of net negative flows for the first time in their short lifespan. These were driven in no small part by record outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), reportedly impacted by moves from bankrupt crypto lender Genesis. Now, commentators are likewise hoping for a return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think market participants are going to do tomorrow night when ETF flows turn positive again?\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets and growth at crypto lender Maple Finance, queried at the weekend. Thompson noted that despite the net outflows wrought by GBTC, the biggest ETF providers have retained their inflows, concluding that \u201cnew buyers are not selling.\u201d \u201cGBTC Sold 31,000 BTC last week and price fell ~ 1%,\u201d Thomas Fahrer, CEO of crypto-focused reviews portal Apollo, continued this week. \u201cIncredible demand to soak up that sell pressure.\u201d Fahrer directly tied \u201ccooling\u201d GBTC outflows to a positive BTC price response to come. This week sees the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index headline U.S. macro data prints. PCE, known to be the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, follows last week\u2019s decision not to cut interest rates. While markets were already prepared, subsequent language from Fed Chair Jerome Powell ignited bets of successive cuts coming before the end of the year. The latest data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool puts the odds of a May cut at 13.7%, up from less than 10% previously. The odds for June are 66%. This week, Powell will speak again, potentially reinforcing those convictions. His March 29 conference appearance nonetheless coincides with the Good Friday holiday, on which stock markets will be closed. \u201cAfter two hot inflation reports this month, all eyes are on the PCE inflation report,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter thus concluded in its weekly diary dates rundown. Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro meanwhile highlighted last week\u2019s U.S. spending package, worth $1.2 trillion, as laying the foundations for further risk-asset upside. \u201cFed confirmed QT will slow soon. Rate cuts coming by year end,\u201d part of one recent X post states. \u201cYou need more BTC!\u201d Despite recent BTC price volatility to the downside, Bitcoin network fundamentals are priming themselves for upward continuation. The latest estimates from monitoring resource BTC.com show mining difficulty holding at this week\u2019s automated readjustment. This will keep the difficulty at or near all-time highs of around 95 trillion, while hash rate paints a similar picture. Raw data from MiningPoolStats shows a new record peak of 741 exahashes per second on March 24. Miners continue to brace for the upcoming block subsidy halving on April 20, which will cut Bitcoin\u2019s emission per newly mined block by 50% to 3.125 BTC. Analyzing the impact of the halving, however, investor Mike Alfred predicted a mass reorganization as miners adjust to the new subsidy regime. \u201cWe will see a major correction in global hashrate post-halving,\u201d he concluded last week. \u201cThere is A LOT of very old equipment on the network squeezing a last bit of profit out before they go in to the dustbin of history. The big public miners all have new equipment coming. Super profits are imminent.\u201d Crypto market sentiment as a whole may still be \u201cgreedy,\u201d but mainstream interest already appears to be waning. Related: Bitcoin price aims for a bullish weekly open \u2014 Will DOGE, TON, STX and FTM follow? The latest data from Google Trends shows that after a modest spike during the recent trip to new all-time highs for BTC/USD, search intensity for Bitcoin is headed back down. Search volume reached only a fraction of its 2021 highs, the figures show, as the average Google user shrugs off Bitcoin\u2019s return to form. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, meanwhile, lingers just below its \u201cextreme greed\u201d zone at 75/100. For statistician Willy Woo, creator of data resource Woobull, however, the power of the Bitcoin bull market is not to be underestimated any more now than before. Comparing Bitcoin to the S&P 500 last week, Woo drew a clear distinction between \u201cTradFi\u201d and Bitcoin market behavior. \u201cIn TradFi bear markets are steep, people freak out,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cIn Bitcoin bull markets are steep, people FOMO.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

A new proposal would see a boost to wind energy for industry use to accelerate carbon neutrality plans, but \u201cBitcoin and cryptocurrency, which use a lot of our energy, are not part of that mission,\u201d Jakobsd√≥ttir said.

With the crypto market again on the rise, venture capital firms are again coming back around to crypto after their hiatus last year \u2014 and Hack VC is one of them. The venture firm is reportedly raising $100 million for a fund aimed at seeding crypto startups, Bloomberg reported on March 23, citing people familiar with the plan. Just last month, Hack VC raised $150 million for a similar crypto and artificial intelligence-focused fund. Hack also raised a $200 million early-stage crypto startup-focused seed fund in February 2022. The crypto market has been on a run so far this year, with Bitcoin twice nailing new all-time highs in March, which has seen VC funding perk up. Blockchain game publisher Immutable launched a $100 million fund for blockchain games last week, and last month VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) put $100 million toward Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer. Bloomberg reported a $50 million nonfungible token (NFT)-aimed raise in the works at Hivemind Capital and a $69 million round for the blockchain Berachain. Compare that to the $5.75 billion across 58 funds crypto-focused VCs raised last year \u2014 below 2022\u2019s record year of $37.7 billion across 262 funds, Galaxy Digital reported in January. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has floated a conceptual Ether (ETH) staking framework dubbed \u201crainbow staking,\u201d which aims to address the blockchain\u2019s centralized staking ecosystem. In a March 21 speech at ETHTaipei, Buterin acknowledged that liquid staking and \u201cstaking in general\u201d had become centralization risks to Ethereum. He said there weren\u2019t enough solo stakers \u2014 those who deposit 32 ETH worth over $111,500 to be a validator \u2014 because it\u2019s expensive and technically difficult. Many who want to stake their ETH instead use a liquid staking protocol such as Lido \u2014 currently the most popular \u2014 which has no minimum deposits and gives users a 1:1 token to use on-chain. The solution, to Buterin, is rainbow staking, with the idea being \u201cyou explicitly split up into two kinds of staking, and you call it heavy staking and light staking,\u201d he said. Heavy staking is slashable \u2014 where staker\u2019s ETH is taken from them as punishment for bad behavior \u2014 and signs all of the blockchain\u2019s slots. Light staking, conversely, isn\u2019t slashable and signs slots based on a lottery. \u201cYou basically try to explicitly separate out those two and potentially require both heavy stakers and light stakers to sign off on a block in order for the block to get finalized,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you try to add the security of both of those approaches together.\u201d Rainbow staking aims to reduce reliance and provide a competitor to liquid staking protocols, but Buterin conceded that more research on the concept is needed before it goes live on the blockchain. Polygon\u2019s beta zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) is back online after a ten-hour outage on March 23 due to an issue with its blockchain sequencer. The zkEVM came back after the outage on March 23 at nearly 9:00 pm UTC, at block number 10989776. In a March 25 X post, Polygon said its Ethereum layer 2 scaling zkEVM had resumed operations after it pulled it into an \u201cemergency state\u201d so its team could apply a fix. It said a detailed post-mortem of the issue is coming \u201cearly next week.\u201d Earlier, Polygon said its zkEVM was down due to \u201can issue with its sequencer,\u201d which organizes, batches and makes sure transactions are in order for sending to Ethereum. The outage only impacted its zkEVM and not its toolkits like Polygon PoS or its Chain Development Kit (CDK). Blockchains deployed using its CDK were also unaffected.

In February, Tron\u2019s founder, Justin Sun, announced a roadmap for Tron\u2019s Bitcoin layer-2 solution in an X post, which would allow stablecoins and tokens to move between Tron and Bitcoin. \u201cThis integration will not only link TRON directly with Bitcoin but also facilitate access to over $55 billion in value to the Bitcoin network, thereby injecting financial vitality into Bitcoin,\u201d said Sun at the time. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Tron spokesperson said the plans would \u201clikely\u201d involve creating a wrapped version of USDT. The Tron network is currently home to more than half of USDT\u2019s $104 billion issued across multiple blockchains. \u201cAs the home of leading stablecoins like USDT, we bring significant liquidity and stability to the table,\u201d Tron told Cointelegraph on Feb. 22. The integration would likely attract new users to the Bitcoin ecosystem and expand the network\u2019s use cases, particularly in decentralized finance, they added. Sun said a Bitcoin layer-2 solution would allow Tron-based tokens to interact and interoperate with Bitcoin \u201cseamlessly.\u201d \u201c[It will aim to] maintain the speed and low fees of POS systems while ensuring the safety of POW & UTXO in conjunction with BTC L2!\u201d The Tron spokesperson said the plan is only in its concept phase but will \u201clikely\u201d go ahead. For the time being, the firm will leverage existing cross-chain protocols to bridge USDT and other tokens between Bitcoin and Tron. Part of Tron\u2019s plan also involves collaborating with several Bitcoin layer-2 protocols. A rival stablecoin to Tether, USD Coin (USDC) could be a different story as Circle, its issuer, ceased minting USDC on Tron in February. The Tron spokesperson said a recent surge in community interest to expand Bitcoin\u2019s functionality and scalability was one of the main reasons why it considered building a layer-2 solution. Developing decentralized applications on Bitcoin could potentially improve Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price dynamics, too, as fees would be denominated in BTC, they added.

Liquid-based Tether (L-USDT) is one of the few United States dollar-denominated stablecoins currently circulating on a Bitcoin layer-2 network.

Max Minton, head of digital assets for Goldman Asia Pacific, said that many of his firm\u2019s largest clients had recently become active or were \u201cexploring getting active\u201d in the crypto sector, according to a March 24 report from Bloomberg. Minton added that much of the increased appetite for cryptocurrency stems from the approval of ten new Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in January, which rubber-stamped the crypto assets as being a more integral part of traditional markets. \u201cThe recent ETF approval has triggered a resurgence of interest and activities from our clients.\u201d Minton explained that the bulk of the fresh demand comes primarily from Goldman\u2019s existing clients by way of his firm\u2019s options and futures offerings, with hedge funds being the most involved of its clients. Goldman Sachs reported a record $2.8 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2023. Notably, Goldman currently does not offer any spot crypto products to its clients, despite having launched its first crypto trading desk in 2021. The desk only provides exposure to crypto derivatives, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) options and futures. \u201cIt was a quieter year last year, but we\u2019ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,\u201d Minton said. Minton said that Goldman\u2019s clients were primarily using their derivatives to gain exposure to the volatility of crypto as well as making weighted predictions on where prices were headed in the mid-term.

Minton also looked to the potential approval of a spot Ether ETF in the U.S. as potentially shifting his firm\u2019s institutional clients toward Ether. However, Bloomberg ETF analysts have pegged the chances of an Ether ETF approval by May at just 35%, with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s prolonged \u201cradio silence\u201d to would-be fund issuers being seen as increasingly bearish. Regardless of an ETF approval, Minton added that Goldman would seek to expand into \u201ca wider universe of clients,\u201d including asset management funds, banks, and more specialized crypto asset firms in the future.

The DeFi platform\u2019s team posted a statement on X on March 24, stating it has returned all assets to wallets that were successfully recovered by white hat hackers and has also revoked permissions to AugustusV6. According to ParaSwap, 213 addresses still have not revoked allowances to the flawed contract. Revoking a smart contract usually involves disabling or terminating its functionality on a blockchain and preventing it from accessing the user\u2019s wallet and tokens. Last week, ParaSwap said it had discovered a vulnerability in a newly launched smart contract, but timely intervention by white hat hackers prevented a large loss of assets from the platform. In a separate update, the team stated that it had taken the first step by submitting a comprehensive report to the appropriate authorities, kickstarting the investigation into the stolen funds. ParaSwap is collaborating closely with blockchain analytics and security firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs and is \u201cactively engaged in identifying hacker addresses and tracing the movement of the funds.\u201d The team added that they had initiated contact with the identified hacker addresses through on-chain messaging, urging the return of the stolen user funds. If the hacker does not respond by March 27, \u201cwe will assume you appropriated the funds with unlawful intent, and we will pursue all criminal, legal, and administrative avenues\u201d to recover them, it added. At the time, the losses were reportedly small, with initial findings revealing that the hackers got away with just $24,000 before the vulnerability was discovered.

This shows that traders remain long-term bullish and are buying the dips. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju expects inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to increase if Bitcoin nears support levels. Young Ju said the new Bitcoin whales, who purchased Bitcoin ETFs, have an on-chain cost basis of $56,000. He anticipates buying to pick up if Bitcoin\u2019s price reaches $56,000. Another positive sign that could support Bitcoin\u2019s price is that outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are slowing down. According to Fairside Investors data, the outflows from GBTC dropped to just $170 million on March 22. This suggests that the selling pressure could be reducing. If Bitcoin ends March above $61,130, it would be the first-ever seven-month winning streak. Could a recovery in Bitcoin trigger buying in select altcoins? Let\u2019s look at the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. Bitcoin has been trading near the 20-day exponential moving average ($65,364) for the past few days, indicating a battle between the bulls and the bears for supremacy. The 20-day EMA is gradually flattening out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The BTC/USDT pair could swing between $60,775 and $69,000 in the near term. If the price remains below the 20-day EMA, the support zone between the 50-day simple moving average ($58,438) and $60,775 may come under pressure. If this zone cracks, the correction could deepen to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $54,298. On the upside, a break and close above $69,000 could open the doors for a retest of $73,777. If this resistance is scaled, the pair may ascend to $80,000. The 4-hour chart shows the bears are capping the relief rallies at the 50-SMA. Hence, this becomes an important level to watch out for. If bulls push the price above the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bearish pressure could be reducing. The pair may then rise to $69,000, which is likely to act as a major hurdle. The immediate support to watch on the downside is $62,260 and then $60,775. If bears sink the price below this support zone, the selling could pick up, and the pair may slide to $59,000. Dogecoin (DOGE) has been range-bound between $0.12 and $0.19 for the past few days. The bulls cleared the $0.16 hurdle on March 24, opening the doors for a rise to $0.19. The 20-day EMA ($0.15) has started to turn up, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. A break and close above $0.19 could start the journey toward $0.23 and later $0.30. Instead, if the price turns down sharply from $0.19, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The DOGE/USDT pair could slide toward the solid support at $0.12. The bears will have to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($0.12) to indicate that the uptrend could be over. The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-EMA, indicating a positive sentiment. Buyers will try to push the price to the overhead resistance of $0.19, where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If bulls do not cede ground to the bears from $0.19, the likelihood of a rally above $0.20 increases. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That may open the doors for a fall to $0.14. Toncoin (TON) surged above the $4.60 resistance on March 23, indicating the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone signal that buyers are in command. The long wick on the March 23 and 24 candlesticks shows profit booking above $5, but if the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, the TON/USDT pair could extend the rally to $5.64. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to drag and sustain the price below $4.60. That may tempt short-term traders to book profits, pulling the pair to the 20-day EMA ($3.79). The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $5 resistance, but have failed to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. This is a positive sign as it suggests that the traders are holding to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. The first support on the downside is the 20-EMA. A slide below this support will suggest that the short-term traders may be booking profits. That could pull the price to the 50-SMA and later to $3.50. Related: Terra founder Do Kwon released in Montenegro The bulls propelled Stacks (STX) above the $3.40 overhead resistance on March 20, indicating that the uptrend remains intact. Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have an advantage. If buyers maintain the price above $3.40, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum, and the STX/USDT pair could rally to $4.29. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and skids below $3.40, it will signal that the markets have rejected the higher levels. The pair may slump to the 20-day EMA ($3.07). A bounce off this level will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below the 20-day EMA could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($2.65). The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-EMA, signaling that the sentiment remains positive. There is a minor resistance at $3.75, but if this level is crossed, the pair may reach $4. The crucial support to watch on the downside is the 20-EMA. If this level gives way, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair may then drop to $3.22. A break below this support could accelerate selling and sink the pair below the 50-SMA. Fantom\u2019s (FTM) long wick on the March 22 candlestick shows profit booking near $1.23. The selling accelerated on March 23, and the bears are attempting to sink the price below $1.02. If they succeed, the FTM/USDT pair could tumble to the 20-day EMA ($0.89). This remains the key short-term level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will signal that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The pair may then retest the $1.23 level. A break above it could clear the path for a rally to $1.50 and eventually to $2. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That could tug the price to the next significant support at $0.72. The bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the 50-SMA to be challenged. Buyers are trying to push the price back above the 20-EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could rise to $1.12 and then to $1.16. Alternatively, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. The pair may then start a downward move to $0.80. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This glitch disrupts transactions and pools, which has prompted the management to update users about fund deposits. According to a post on the X social platform, the technical team at RippleX has identified a discrepancy in a limited number of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger, leading to transactions being processed incorrectly. AMM pools are liquidity pools used on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate trading without the need for traditional order books. In an AMM pool, traders can swap assets directly with the pool rather than with other traders. The pool contains reserves of various assets, and prices are determined algorithmically based on the ratio of assets in the pool. Due to the continuing technical issue, RippleX has recommended its users no longer deposit funds into the affected AMM pools. This preventive action is meant to eliminate any possible complications that the current glitch may cause. Those with liquidity provider (LP) tokens in these pools are advised to redeem them until the matter is resolved. Nevertheless, RippleX\u2019s technical team is actively addressing the bug and focusing on restoring regular operations within the AMM pools. The company said it is committed to resolving this issue promptly and has engaged with community members to assist in troubleshooting.

According to a Bloomberg report, he was released on Saturday, March 23. The Supreme Court halted the extradition of the Terraform Labs co-founder to South Korea, suspending a lower court\u2019s ruling. Kwon is currently facing fraud allegations in both South Korea and the U.S. stemming from the Terra collapse, which resulted in the loss of approximately $60 billion in market value in 2022. Prison director Darko Vukcevic reportedly said by phone: \u201cWe released Do Kwon from prison as his regular prison term for traveling with fake papers ended. Since he is a foreign citizen and his documents were withheld, he was taken for an interview to the police directorate for foreigners, and they will deal with him further.\u201d The decision to release Kwon reportedly came from the Council of the Supreme Court, which is set to review a decision that could grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea. In South Korea, penalties are comparatively milder than in the U.S., where prosecutors seek to prosecute Kwon for the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin\u2019s $40-billion collapse in 2022.

Extradition to either country awaits further court deliberations, with no specified timeline provided after the announcement on Friday. If extradited to the United States, the Terraform Labs co-founder would likely face eight felony charges filed by prosecutors in March 2023.

However, the services they can provide may struggle to gain momentum due to government restrictions on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms aimed at curbing free market promotion, according to Ray Youssef, the CEO of NoOnes, a financial communication and P2P app. A recent report by Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed an amendment to the rules guiding platforms offering crypto services and suggested a hike in the registration fee for crypto exchanges from 30 million naira ($18,620) to 150 million naira ($93,000). Speaking with Cointelegraph, Youssef, who is the co-founder and former CEO of the shuttered P2P exchange Paxful, said the increase is an invitation for the crypto \u201cbig boys\u201d like Coinbase and other major companies to operate in the Nigerian market. He emphasized that the government aims to restrict P2P services to address foreign exchange challenges, and exchanges willing to forgo P2P support can operate smoothly in Nigeria. However, this strategy conflicts with the Nigerian crypto market\u2019s strong preference for P2P trading, posing a considerable obstacle for exchanges. However, Youssef remains optimistic about Nigeria\u2019s chance of maintaining its position in the ecosystem despite the recent regulation challenges. Related: Nigerian court orders Binance to disclose all user data Youssef said the government could use the abundance of P2P traders in Nigeria as an asset and treat crypto stakeholders as allies to understand how to use crypto to the advantage of the nation\u2019s economy. Nigeria is currently the largest P2P crypto market in the world, which came about after the Central Bank of Nigeria banned institutions from buying and selling crypto in 2021. In December 2023, the Nigerian government lifted the 2021 crypto ban, enabling crypto exchanges to apply for licenses in Nigeria. Commenting on the recent partnership between Gluwa and the Nigerian government to improve the adoption of the nation\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eNaira, Youssef said the government could have taken a different approach when introducing the CBDC by leveraging it to stimulate local economic growth, providing credit to aspiring entrepreneurs and encouraging the younger generation to embrace it. The Nigerian government has often been at odds with cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance ceased operations using the naira on March 8 after Nigerian government criticism of crypto exchanges singled it out in February.

A majority of the European Parliament\u2019s lead committees have scrapped a 1,000 euro ($1,080) limit on cryptocurrency payments from self-hosted crypto wallets as part of new anti-money laundering laws. On March 19, the European Union\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee passed the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), which the European Council and Parliament provisionally agreed to in January. An earlier proposal that saw businesses limited to 1,000 euros if using a self-hosted crypto wallet to transact was removed along with a provision that aimed to implement identity checks on self-hosted wallets receiving funds. However, crypto exchanges, called crypto asset service providers (CASPs) in the EU, must perform \u201ccustomer due diligence\u201d \u2014 identity verification checks \u2014 on users who carry out business transactions of at least 1,000 euros. The law works alongside the crypto-focused Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) laws and others to cement existing prohibitions on CASPs from providing accounts for anonymous users or for privacy coins such as Monero (XMR), which hide information about transactions. CASPs must also \u201capply mitigating measures\u201d to transfers between their platform and self-custody wallets \u2014 where users hold their private keys \u2014 which include at least verifying the identity of the exchange wallet holder where funds from a self-custody wallet were sent. The laws limited cash payments to $10,800 (10,000 euros) \u2014 with EU member states able to set lower limits \u2014 and banned anonymous cash payments over $3,240 (3,000 euros). The AMLR is expected to be fully operational within three years \u2014 sometime in 2027 \u2014 after it gets approval from the EU Council and the European Parliament plenary which next sits on April 10. In a March 21 X post, Pirate Party Germany European Parliament member Patrick Breyer called the new laws a \u201cwar on cash.\" In a press release, Breyer outlined his opposition to the bill, saying it compromises economic independence and financial privacy.

In a post on X on March 22, Young Ju said spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF netflows could rise even as the BTC price decline continues. Using data from the historical net flow trends, the CEO noted that demand for Bitcoin ETFs usually kicks in when the cryptocurrency traces to certain support levels. According to data from analytics firm BitMEX Research, the spot BTC ETFs have recorded negative net flows for the last four trading sessions, characterized by continuing outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF and declining inflows to other BTC ETFs. Young Ju noted that new BTC whales, especially ETF buyers, have an on-chain cost basis of around $56,000, and he expects significant inflows to the ETFs to resume if Bitcoin dips to this level. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, BTC\u2019s price has fluctuated between $62,000 and $68,000 in the past week. Young Ju suggests that a further decline in price is possible, given that corrections typically see a maximum drop of around 30%, which would see Bitcoin drop to around $51,000 from its recent all-time high of $73,750.

The United States Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been at the center of attention for arguably the wrong reasons this week. Inflows have declined significantly versus the start of March, while GBTC outflows hit record highs, producing five consecutive days of net reductions in assets under management (GBTC).

In his own assessment of the week\u2019s flows, he remained optimistic on near-term BTC price action, suggesting that tailwinds for a return to price discovery could be in place by next week. \u201cNow we'll most likely have a sideways weekend and potentially consolidate a bit more next week before the path up to new ATH,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLots of people shaken out, lots of people waiting for lower.

On March 20, Bloomberg reported data sourced from cryptocurrency exchange Lemon Cash revealing that nearly 35,000 customers in Argentina purchased Bitcoin in the week ending March 10, double the weekly average compared to 2023. A major factor for the increase in demand is the ongoing decline of the nation\u2019s currency. Over the past twelve months, the peso\u2019s value against the United States dollar has plummeted, dropping from $0.0049/peso in March 2023 to $0.0012/peso at the time of publication. However, it was noted that Lemon wasn\u2019t the only platform seeing a surge in demand. Other major exchanges in Argentina, such as Ripio and Belo, reported similar trends. According to the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, Manuel Beaudroi, stablecoin purchases in Argentina declined from 70% to 60% as Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge attracted more interest. \u201cThe user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.\u201d He also claimed that Belo has seen volume in Bitcoin and Ether increase \u201ctenfold so far in 2024 compared to the same period last year.\u201d However, a recent report suggests that interest in stablecoins might still exist, as Argentines may choose not to use the well-known exchanges within the country to purchase them. On Feb. 12, Cointelegraph reported that Argentines are using black market exchanges, known locally as \u201ccrypto caves,\u201d to buy U.S. dollar stablecoins in an effort to escape strict currency controls and the rising inflation of the peso.

Ether has seen a 9% decline over the past week, underperforming when compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, leading traders to speculate whether the current support level of $3,200 will hold. For context, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by 2.5% during the same timeframe. From a bullish viewpoint, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) remains a key catalyst. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing the matter, with a final decision anticipated by May 23. However, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart does not consider approval as his base scenario. The recent upgrades to the Ethereum protocol should not be overlooked. The Dencun hard fork, which took place on March 13, aimed at enhancing the network's scalability and improving layer-2 data processing capabilities, is highly sought after by rollup solutions. As a result, transaction fees for most applications on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have significantly decreased. Cointelegraph notes that, in theory, Dencun\u2019s enhancements are expected to encourage Ethereum users to embrace layer-2 solutions. Data indicates a surge in 7-day volumes for Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base by 145%, 144%, and 203%, respectively, thereby alleviating some of the downward pressure on Ether\u2019s price that was attributed to high gas fees. It's worth noting that competitors like BNB Chain (BNB) and Solana (SOL) provide significantly lower transaction fees at the base layer, which often appears more accessible to newcomers. Despite the positive impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, Solana\u2019s decentralized application (DApps) volumes have increased by 57% over the last week, according to DappRadar. The bearish outlook for Ether\u2019s mid-term price is bolstered by the increasingly complex regulatory environment in the United States. Cointelegraph reported on March 20 that the SEC is scrutinizing companies for possible connections with the Ethereum Foundation, aiming to classify Ether as a security. This move by the SEC was reportedly sparked by Ethereum\u2019s transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network, with several U.S.-based companies being asked to submit financial records and documents related to their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation. Market experts, including Van Buren Capital and lawyer Scott Johnsson, suggest that the SEC's probe into Ether's status as a security serves as \"an additional pretext to deny\" the spot Ether ETF applications. However, this perspective is not universally shared, with Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, arguing, \"The SEC has no valid reason to reject the Ether ETP applications.\" To understand if professional traders flipped bearish after Ether\u2019s price decline, one should use the ETH options 25% delta skew as a proxy. A skew metric rising above 7% indicates anticipations of a price drop, whereas a negative 7% skew typically reflects bullish sentiment. From March 21 to the present, the ETH options 25% skew has increased from 0% to 5%, suggesting a cautious skepticism toward the $3,200 support level. However, one might argue that despite an 11% correction in Ether's price over a week, the skew metric has stayed in neutral territory, showing little sign that bearish sentiment has intensified. Looking at the bigger picture, the Ethereum network maintains its leading position in terms of deposits, with a total value locked (TVL) of $94 billion. The initiative by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, to launch a tokenized asset fund on Ethereum solidifies the network's prominence. Consequently, there seems to be no compelling reason to doubt that Ether's support at $3,200 will break in the near term. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The shares are being shopped through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), according to CNBC\u2019s sources. This is likely due to the fact that FTX is bankrupt, as SPVs are essentially separate corporate legal entities that exist to ensure a parent company can meet its legal obligations in the event of insolvency.

According to a March 22 report from Montenegrin news outlet Vijesti, Kwon will be allowed to leave prison on March 23 after being held in custody for roughly a year but forced to surrender his travel documents to prevent him from leaving the country. The decision to release Kwon reportedly came from the Council of the Supreme Court, which is set to review a decision that could grant or deny extradition to his native South Korea. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for using falsified travel documents with his colleague, Terraform Labs\u2019 former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon.

Tabata\u2019s comments came during a seminar held by Human Academy featuring former Square Enix president Yoichi Wada and Tabata, who is now the CEO of JP Games. According to a Google translation of a report from Japanese news source 4Gamer, the two gaming industry luminaries discussed the future of gaming with topics ranging from \u201cwhat is required of creators now\" to \u201cthese people are not suitable for creators\". Creators who haven\u2019t tried generative artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT or dabbled in Web3 and metaverse development won\u2019t be able to keep up with the needs of the industry going forward, according to Wada and Tabata.

The pullback has dampened sentiment in the short term, resulting in net outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for four straight days, according to data from Farside Investors. However, the Bitcoin bull market is not yet over, according to a report by CryptoQuant. The on-chain data analytics firm said the bull market generally ends with \u201c84%-92% of investment\u201d from the short-term holders, which currently is at 48%. The correction before the Bitcoin Halving is a healthy sign for the long-term sustainability of the bull market because parabolic moves are rarely sustainable. Every dip shakes out the weak hands and allows the stronger hands to add to their positions. Will Bitcoin and altcoins continue their correction, or is it time for the recovery to begin? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin rebounded sharply off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $61,736, indicating that traders view the dips as a buying opportunity. The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) has flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, suggesting a range-bound action in the near term. The BTC/USDT pair may face resistance at $69,000 and support at $60,775. A consolidation near the high is a positive sign, showing the bulls are holding on to their positions and not rushing to the exit. A break above $69,000 could open the doors for a retest of the all-time high at $73,777. The downside support is at $60,775, followed by the 50-day SMA ($57,623). Buyers are expected to defend this zone with vigor. Ether (ETH) snapped back from the 50-day SMA ($3,161) on March 20, but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA ($3,537). The ETH/USDT pair turned down from the 20-day EMA on March 22, indicating that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. Sellers will make one more attempt to break the 50-day SMA support. If they succeed, the pair may collapse to $2,717. Instead, if the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, it will signal that the pair may remain between the moving averages. The bullish momentum could pick up after the pair rises above $3,700. The pair may then reach the overhead resistance at $4,100. BNB (BNB) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($520) on March 20, but the relief rally faces resistance near $590. The long wick on the March 22 candlestick shows selling near $590. The bears will again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and open the gates for a drop to the breakout level of $460. This level is likely to witness aggressive buying by the bulls. On the upside, a break above $590 could push the BNB/USDT pair to the stiff overhead resistance at $645. If this resistance is taken out, the uptrend may continue, and the pair could rally to $692. Solana (SOL) witnessed solid buying at the 20-day EMA ($163) on March 20, but the bulls could not drive the price above $205. The failure to clear the overhead resistance shows that the bears are active at higher levels. If the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal advantage to bears. The SOL/USDT pair could slump to the strong support at $126. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bulls continue to buy on dips. The pair could then rise to $205. If this level is scaled, the pair may ascend to $267. XRP (XRP) bounced off the uptrend line on March 20 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.62) on March 21, signaling buying at lower levels. If buyers shove the price above $0.67, the XRP/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and travel to the formidable resistance at $0.74. This is an important level to watch out for because a break above it could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend to $0.95. On the contrary, if the price turns down and maintains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that higher levels are attracting sellers. The pair may oscillate between $0.67 and the uptrend line. A slide below the uptrend line could tug the pair to $0.52. The bulls successfully defended the $0.57 support in Cardano (ADA) on March 20 but are struggling to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.63). The 20-day EMA ($0.67) has turned down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have the upper hand. Sellers will make another attempt to sink the price below the $0.57 support. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $0.53 and later to $0.46. On the other hand, if the price rebounds off the $0.57 support, it will suggest that the bulls are defending the level. The pair will then make another attempt to rise to the 20-day EMA. A break above $0.70 will indicate that the correction is over. Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) relief rally rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.15) on March 20, indicating solid buying at lower levels. The bulls are trying to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the DOGE/USDT pair will again attempt to rise above $0.16 and challenge the overhead resistance of $0.19. This level may prove to be a difficult hurdle to cross. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.12 and $0.19. The next leg of the uptrend is likely to begin after buyers kick and maintain the price above $0.19. The pair may then rise to $0.23. Related: Is Bitcoin price going to crash again? Buyers have managed to keep Avalanche (AVAX) above the breakout level of $50, suggesting they are trying to flip the level into support. The marginally rising 20-day EMA ($51) and the RSI in the positive territory show that the bulls have the edge. The AVAX/USDT pair could gradually increase to the $62 to $65 resistance zone. Sellers are expected to protect this zone with vigor. If the price turns down from this zone, the pair may consolidate between $50 and $65 for a few more days. The uptrend could resume after buyers overcome the obstacle at $65. The pair could thereafter climb to $75. The trend will favor the bears if the price plunges below $50. The failure of the bulls to push Shiba Inu (SHIB) above the breakdown level of $0.000029 suggests that bears are selling on rallies. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.000027) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if the price rises above the resistance line. The SHIB/USDT pair could rise to $0.000035 and eventually to the strong resistance at $0.000039. Alternatively, if the price continues lower and breaks below $0.000023, the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA ($0.000018). The bulls are trying to push Toncoin (TON) to $4.60, but the long wick on the March 22 candlestick shows stiff resistance from the bears. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($3.54) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in control. If buyers do not give up much ground from the current level, the possibility of a break above $4.60 remains high. If that happens, the TON/USDT pair could start the next leg of the rally at $5.64. Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, the pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It\u2019s unclear what price tag the government intends to use for the aircraft, which cost $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, according to October 2023 court filings. Prosecutors said they intended to reimburse up to $1.8 million related to maintenance and upkeep and $183,000 for delivery of the Legacy, assuming the proceeds from the sale were sufficient.

After a variety of projects using new technologies, the pillar of the current international payments system has thrown its weight behind a unified ledger payment model. SWIFT looked in particular at tokenization and the shared ledger model, according to a post on its website. Common infrastructure could provide real-time balance to all of the participants in the shared ledger, it said. That\u2019s not to say messaging is unneeded, SWIFT was quick to add: \u201cShared ledgers are not well suited to carrying and storing high volumes of data due to the way data is synchronised across parties and the computing power required. This is where a messaging layer fits in.\u201d \u201cFor transactions to be frictionless, additional types of data also need to be transferred to enable value-added services such as AML, compliance, sanctions screening, trade and accounts receivable reconciliation,\u201d it continued. Related: WEF 2022: SWIFT probably won\u2019t exist in 5 years, says Mastercard CEO Rather than starting a unified ledger from scratch, SWIFT suggested the creation of a state machine \u2014 \u201ca dynamic model that reflects the current state of transactions and balances across institutions\u201d \u2014 that could be built on the ISO-20022 messaging technology already in use. It could work on a blockchain or on a centralized platform like SWIFT\u2019s Transaction Manager. Unified ledger technology has been embraced by the International Monetary Fund in its XC platform and by financial institutions participating in the Regulated Liability Network. The Bank for International Settlements has also endorsed the model. SWIFT, which was founded in 1973, settled on the unified ledger model after considering several other options. In 2022, it teamed up with fintech firm Symbiont in a pilot project to upgrade its information delivery to corporate clients through Symbiont\u2019s blockchain-driven Assembly platform. SWIFT argued against the use of a unified ledger in a 2023 report in favor of SWIFT as a \u201csingle point of access\u201d to different blockchain networks. SWIFT plays a key role in the imposition of economic sanctions worldwide. In February 2022, at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission ordered the removal of an unknown number of Russian banks from SWIFT.

Bitcoin (BTC) futures play an essential role since traders can use leverage; thus, the larger this market becomes, the greater its price impact. The aggregate Bitcoin futures open interest reached a $36 billion all-time high on March 21, up from $30 billion two weeks prior. Moreover, the market leader, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), achieved an $11.9 billion open interest, surpassing the inflow of United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their inception. Despite the successful debut of spot ETFs, some analysts anticipated reduced volatility, given that these instruments trade over $3 billion per day on average. However, recent data indicates the opposite, as Bitcoin\u2019s volatility has increased in the last four weeks. Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day volatility surged above 80%, marking its highest level in over 15 months. For comparison, the S&P 500 index volatility stands at 13%, while WTI oil futures stand at 23%. Even stocks traditionally considered volatile in the traditional market, such as Nvidia and Unity Software, currently exhibit volatility of 72% and 59%, respectively. Volatility examples in Bitcoin include a 10% correction on March 19, reaching a low of $60,795, followed by a 12% gain on March 20. This unforeseen price swing resulted in $375 million of forced liquidations in BTC futures contracts over two days. While this movement may not directly impact holders, it certainly influences the trajectory of the bull run and, more significantly, Bitcoin\u2019s risk perception by the broader market. The Bitcoin futures market, like any derivatives instrument, is a double-edged sword: It enables leveraged bullish and bearish bets. While entities aggressively shorting BTC futures may seem detrimental to the spot Bitcoin price, ultimately, the derivatives trade must be settled, either through buying back the contract or forced liquidation. Consequently, if Bitcoin\u2019s price was suppressed by investors using leveraged shorts, one should anticipate the movement to eventually reverse, leading to short-term buying pressure. This partly explains why high futures open interest is linked to increased volatility. Some analysts attribute the added volatility to excessive leverage, while others simply attribute it to \u201cmanipulation.\u201d X user Amit Kukreja, for instance, alleged that market makers have been pursuing leveraged longs and shorts. He claimed that stocks directly related to the sector, such as the miner CleanSpark, gained 7% on the day Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed to $68,000. While suppositions can be made, it is impossible to ascertain the rationale behind each market participant\u2019s intentions. To determine whether Bitcoin futures contracts have been used to exert negative pressure on BTC\u2019s price, one should analyze the monthly contracts premium. These are the preferred instruments of professional traders due to the absence of a funding rate. To compensate for the extended settlement period, sellers typically demand a 5% to 10% premium relative to spot markets. Related: History of Crypto: Bitcoin \u2014 Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s response to the global financial crisis The BTC futures premium has maintained levels above 16% for the past three weeks, which is typical of bullish markets. Furthermore, the indicator has not significantly declined even after Bitcoin\u2019s price fell by 17.6% between March 14 and March 20. If anything, the demand for leverage on Bitcoin\u2019s futures appears to be more heavily concentrated on the buy side. Conversely, if the Bitcoin price continues to downtrend, those leveraged buyers might face forced liquidation, leading to drastic consequences given the $36 billion open interest.

But now the credibility, the sponsorship, and the support for crypto have completely changed,\u201d he said during the AMA. He also believes that Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to be the focal point thanks to ETFs, with less regulatory debate around its classification as a security and lower-risk option. Kimmel noted that the size of the investment that institutions are bringing to the market is much larger than retail investors. Highlighting the prevalence of large over-the-counter (OTC) trades focused primarily on Bitcoin, Kimmel explained that the same trends are evident within M2. However, altcoins are also starting to gain momentum, with utility tokens such as the platform\u2019s MMX attracting institutional interest. The primary use case for MMX is to increase returns within M2\u2019s Earn program. By burning MMX tokens, users can increase their yields on locked crypto holdings. This burning mechanism also reduces MMX\u2019s overall supply, which had an initial supply of 500 million. MMX holders will also benefit from reduced trading fees, a rewards program, and access to higher tiers within the upcoming payment card program. As noted by Kimmel, M2 prioritizes user empowerment through features designed to make crypto more accessible and appealing to retail investors. The platform\u2019s flagship product, the Earn program, with its flexible lockup periods and interest earned in deposited currency (10.5% for Bitcoin and Ethereum), caters to diverse risk appetites. There\u2019s also an early redemption option for a fee, covering unexpected needs. With a surge of institutional interest in crypto, the question may arise as to whether this shift contradicts the core principles of Web3. Kimmel argued: \u201cThe majority of people want convenience. When they can call someone if something goes wrong and there is actually someone there to fix it. That may go against the crypto ethos of having no middlemen and not being dependent on third parties. But there\u2019s still a significant market for that, a very important part of crypto that drives innovation. However, you must have that regulated aspect to make it available to a broader audience, especially for institutions.\u201d Kimmel also noted that M2 accepts all investors, including SMEs and institutions, to emphasize trade finance solutions. The platform plans to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, aiming to simplify payments within the trade finance space. M2\u2019s roadmap also includes crypto lending, additional investment options and structured products, suggesting a clear product roadmap through the year. Kimmel also teased upcoming features such as crypto debit cards, the launch of a referral program and additional language support.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Blockchain, #Markets, #Cryptocurrency Exchange"},{"date":"Mar 22, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-7-win-streak-month-first-time","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin eyes 7-month win streak for the first time","type":"Blog","category":"Markets News","content":"Bitcoin could be on track to close its seventh consecutive month in the green for the first time in history.

Dencun launched on March 13 with the promise of ushering in a new era of faster and cheaper transactions. Ethereum has historically struggled to ratchet up the speed of its base layer in line with demand, so Dencun shifts focus by scaling with the aid of layer 2s. According to Brian Gallagher, co-founder of Partisia blockchain, the update is not a minute too soon as competition from rival blockchains threatens to erode Ethereum\u2019s market dominance. \u201cThe timing for Ethereum to launch its Dencun update [couldn\u2019t] wait any longer,\u201d Gallagher told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that Solana is growing its market share away from Ethereum, particularly in the new token launch, on-chain DEX [decentralized exchange] swaps and NFT [nonfungible token] arenas, where retail traders tend to hang out.\u201d Gallagher added, \u201cIt is simply far too expensive to make on-chain transactions still on Ethereum, so alternatives like Solana are rising up to the occasion.\u201d As Gallagher points out, the comparison of fees is not currently flattering for Ethereum. Typical fees on Ethereum are anything from $1\u201320. This starkly contrasts Solana, where fees are a fraction of a cent. As recently as March 5, fees on Ethereum soared above $30. Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues are nothing new. The matter first grew acute when transaction fees rose from under $1 to the $5 mark in September 2020, then above $20 at the end of 2021 and through into 2022. On April 30, 2022, the average fee soared to an all-time high of $197. Previous upgrades to the Ethereum network have attempted to improve the speed and scalability of Ethereum\u2019s base layer. The most significant of these was the Merge, which occurred on Sept. 15, 2022, and completed Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The Merge may have made Ethereum more energy efficient, but if there were any small reductions to transaction fees, they weren\u2019t to last. By March 2023, fees were beginning to creep upward once more. Recent: Bitcoin price retraces 30 days ahead of halving in historical pattern Dencun is different. Instead of attempting to make Ethereum\u2019s base layer more scalable, Dencun focuses on improving interactions with layer 2s, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, making them cheaper. In theory, Dencun\u2019s improvements should incentivize and encourage users to shift traffic from Ethereum\u2019s layer 1, spreading the traffic to other networks. While Dencun is still in its infancy, the early feedback is encouraging. Dencun promised to drop fees on layer 2s by a factor of 10. Data from Dune Analytics shows it has succeeded in that aim and, in some cases, even surpassed it. According to L2 Fees, transaction costs on Optimism and Arbitrum are now below $0.01. With Dencun delivering right out of the gate, there is a palpable sense of excitement among many within the Ethereum community. Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), is among those lauding the development. Johnson told Cointelegraph: \u201cThe Dencun upgrade ushers in a new era for Ethereum, in terms of economic sustainability. For so long, layer 2 developers have incurred costly transaction fees that have hindered accessibility to the network. The ENS developer team is looking forward to improved accessibility for Ethereum.\u201d As for those layer 2s Johson referenced, the buzz from their camps has been noticeable. Arbitrum took to X to declare Dencun, \u201cOne of the biggest upgrades to support layer 2s in scaling Ethereum,\u201d while Optimism said, \u201cToday is going to be a good day.\u201d Given that Dencun has already lowered transaction costs by more than 90%, the general mood of positivity appears justified. Dencun may have succeeded in its initial goals, but the market will determine what happens next. For Dencun to truly succeed, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Loopring, Polygon and others will need to pry users away from the Ethereum base layer. Recent: Greens\u2019 push to end German cryptocurrency tax exemption sparks debate The early signs are encouraging here, too. Data from GrowThePie shows that transaction volume on Arbitrum has increased by 145% in the last seven days, while Optimism has increased by 144%. On-base transaction volume has increased by 203% over the same period. Gallagher says that with Dencun up and running, the focal point over the longer term \u201cwill be on DeFi [decentralized finance] and how this upgrade potentially increases speed and lowers cost. If it fails to lower costs significantly, then I believe market share will continue to grow on other chains that are faster and more affordable.\u201d Given that Dencun is yet to be tested against everything the crypto market can throw at it, Gallagher\u2019s note of caution is a reminder against complacency. But for the moment, Ethereum\u2019s latest upgrade looks like a job well done.","tags":"#Ethereum, #Transactions, #Adoption, #Layer2, #Transaction Fee, #Dencun Upgrade"},{"date":"Mar 22, 2024","summary":"","author":"Nihatcan Yanik","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/innovative-ai-engine-to-decode-and-elevate-web3-community-conversations","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Innovative AI engine to decode and elevate Web3 community conversations","type":"Blog","category":"Spotlight","content":" Chappyz utilizes AI-powered proprietary technology to analyze, score and incentivize relevant conversations, bridging traditional internet spaces with decentralized communities.

A former ENS core team member, Brantly Millegan, noticed the update and posted the news on X. Cointelegraph confirmed the feature by testing it with several ENS addresses, including Vitalik.eth, an address belonging to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain network. The displayed result showed the address particulars, such as Ether (ETH) balance and the time of the latest transaction. The data is collected from Ethereum block explorer Etherscan. Ethereum Name Service allows the use of complex wallet addresses on the internet in the exact way domains are used. For example, instead of complex numbers, you get an ENS address like yourname.eth, which you can easily share. This is similar to quickly accessing websites directly through domains instead of IP addresses. Google has become increasingly involved with crypto and blockchain technology. In May 2023, it introduced native support for Ethereum wallet balances. Initially, users could search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance directly in the search results. This functionality has now been expanded to ENS domains. In 2022, Google integrated a crypto feature enabling some Ethereum wallet addresses to have their Ether balances tracked by the Google search engine, saving the need to make the trip to Etherscan. The feature was first made public by a principal at Google Ventures, Han Hua, in an Oct. 11, 2022 post. In addition, the firm also initiated a countdown to the Ethereum Merge event in 2022 by featuring animated pandas moving in sync. In 2023, Google revised its crypto advertising policy to include \u201cCryptocurrency Coin Trusts.\u201d These products enable investors to trade shares in trusts holding digital assets.

The GoDaddy-ENS partnership eliminates the barrier of high gas fees that previously dissuaded users from bringing domain names over to ENS. ENS enabled the cost-free transition by deploying new smart contracts for resolution. As a result, DNS domain holders can realize a new form of self-sovereignty by having greater control over their own decentralized identities.

According to local media outlet Business Daily Africa, Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Administration of National Government, Kithure Kindiki, told parliament that the government will not lift the suspension it imposed in August 2023 on the activities of Worldcoin. Kindiki said the suspension would remain in effect until assurances of the safety and integrity of financial deals are provided. Speaking to the National Assembly\u2019s Public Petitions Committee, Kindiki revealed that Kenya has encountered pressure from the U.S. government to remove the suspension on Worldcoin\u2019s activities. On Aug. 2, 2023, Kindiki announced the suspension of Worldcoin\u2019s activities until relevant public agencies certify the absence of risks to Kenyans. The cabinet secretary stressed that the government of Kenya is specifically concerned with Worldcoin collecting crucial identification information like iris scans in exchange for a digital ID. Nearly three weeks after the suspension of Worldcoin, the Kenyan government formed a 15-member parliamentary committee headed by Gabriel Tongoyo, a member of parliament, to look into the controversial crypto project. Related: Worldcoin says it\u2019s legal in all countries it operates in despite Spanish ban Worldcoin gained notoriety in Kenya as hundreds thronged venues in the country to register for the program by scanning their iris using Worldcoin\u2019s Orb device and receiving 25 Worldcoin (WLD) tokens worth approximately 7,700 shillings ($54.60) at the time. Apart from the parliamentary committee, a court also suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities after the data commissioner\u2019s office filed a case. The court ordered that the data already collected by Worldcoin between April and August 2023 be preserved pending completion of the lawsuit.

Harry Grieve, co-founder of machine learning compute network Gensyn, spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph during the ETHGlobal event in London about the promise of peer-to-peer computing networks challenging Web2 services like Amazon Web Services. Gensyn is an in-development decentralized network that will enable people to connect to various devices across the internet to train machine learning models. The company is backed by several Web3 venture capital firms and raised $50 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2023. Grieve says the network holds significant potential as the internet changes to a more dynamic representation of information that will empower \u201cself-sovereignty and computational liberty online.\u201d Gensyn has been in development since 2020, with Grieve and co-founder Ben Fielding researching machine learning computing for training and decentralized verifiable systems. The pair have been looking to solve a threefold problem with blockchain-based technology. \u201cHow can you peer with another device and train a machine learning model on that device where A), the device is untrusted? B), your training model can\u2019t fit on that single device. And C, you want the achievable scale of the entire system and unit economic outcomes as good as AWS,\u201d Grieve said. Gensyn\u2019s lite paper describes the protocol as \u201ca layer-1 trustless protocol for deep learning computation.\u201d The network directly and immediately rewards participants for availing computing resources to the network and performing ML tasks. Grieve said the challenge of building the network is verifying completed ML work, which sits at the intersection of complexity theory, game theory, cryptography and optimization: \u201cWe realized that if you want to build this in a decentralized way, you need a way to reach a decentralized consensus about who did what. That\u2019s basically all a blockchain is.\u201d Gensyn takes some inspiration from the ideals of the Bitcoin protocol, and Grieve says he\u2019s a big believer in the old Bitcoin laptop mining days, where users could acquire BTC when it was still possible for smaller devices to be used for mining: \u201cSatoshi gave people the right to their money again; they could generate it from a laptop. They could convert electricity into money. They could convert fiat into something harder.\u201d While the long-term plan is to make Gensyn a tool that allows a wide set of users and hardware to provide or access computing resources for ML training, the initial launch will target users with more graphics processing units (GPUs) because they represent the quickest way to get a lot of feedback. \u201cWe are thoroughly planning on people building on top of Gensyn to make more user-friendly, supply-side, and contribution applications. Ultimately, an individual with a laptop will be able to download our client and run it in a way that connects you to the network,\u201d Grieve said. Related: io.net adds Apple chip support to its cloud-based GPU-sourcing network Apple\u2019s Silicon chips also promise to unlock massive global computing resources. Grieve says that research into Apple M2 and M3 chips shows that the hardware reaches parity with mid-tier, current-generation consumer Nvidia RTX GPUs. This provides two potential major benefits for protocols like Gensyn, which could tap into a broad set of devices to contribute to its global supercluster. Grieve says: \u201cI think people are more likely to have something that looks like a MacBook than a standalone GPU, so it\u2019s a much more like democratizing force if you can contribute that.\u201d Apple Silicon chips are also highly versatile, acting as a \u201csystem on a chip\u201d that could be emulated by other chip manufacturers. Grieve believes the future could have more edge devices that are far more powerful than existing smartphones, adding that decentralizing across lots of devices and verifying device-agnostically is essential. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Solana-based decentralized network io.net will onboard Apple Silicon chip hardware for its artificial intelligence and machine learning services.

Lying and exploiting your friends, portcos, and people around you is another.\u201d In an episode of the Unchained Podcast, Davies refused to apologize to investors for billions lost in 3AC\u2019s bankruptcy and the collapse of 3AC and remained adamant that his professional reputation was still intact despite receiving outsized backlash for his past misdeeds on social media. Davies wrote on X: \u201cWe were traders who devoutly believed in up only forever. Still do. Lenders chose to gamble their own low-risk client\u2019s funds on a high-risk thesis.\u201d However, Pellegrino criticized Davies for misleading and taking advantage of associates and partners. Pellegrino further asserted that 3AC was financially unstable when proposing the arrangement to LayerZero. Davies had not responded to Pellegrino\u2019s posts on X at the time of publication.

Davies and Su Zhu, the co-founders of 3AC, subsequently launched Open Exchange (OPNX), a platform for crypto derivatives and claims trading, in April 2023. However, the platform ceased operations earlier this year, in February. On Jan. 5, 2023, Davies and Zhu were subpoenaed via X because they avoided communication with the relevant authorities and \u201cdid not yield satisfactory cooperation\u201d with liquidators. Zhu was arrested in Singapore last September and was jailed until December for non-cooperation in 3AC\u2019s liquidation inquiries. Davies, however, avoided apprehension. In a recent podcast, Davies said he stayed clear of Singapore to evade potential imprisonment. On Dec. 21, a British Virgin Islands court froze $1.14 billion worth of Davies and Zhu\u2019s assets. 3AC liquidator Teneo is seeking to recover $1.3 billion directly from Zhu and Davies, claiming they took on significant leverage with investor funds after 3AC became insolvent.

The report \u2014 published on March 21 by a group of researchers from multiple United States-based universities \u2014 identified the vulnerability as a side channel exploit, which allows hackers to illicitly obtain end-to-end encryption keys when Apple chips execute commonly used cryptographic protocols. However, unlike conventional vulnerabilities that can be remedied through direct patches, this particular issue is deeply rooted in the microarchitectural design of the silicon itself, making it \u201cunpatchable.\u201d To properly address the flaw, third-party cryptographic software would need to be utilized and could severely hamper the performance of the Apple M-series chips, particularly the earlier iterations, such as the M1 and M2 chips. These findings highlight a major flaw and challenge for Apple\u2019s hardware security infrastructure. Hackers could intercept and exploit memory access patterns to extract sensitive information, such as encryption keys utilized by cryptographic applications.

One user said they believed that Apple would mitigate the problem within their operating system directly \u2014 if not, they would be \u201cmore worried.\u201d Another user said this flaw has been known to Apple for a while and pointed out that it could be why Apple\u2019s M3 has \u201can added instruction to disable DMP.\u201d The user said the previous research on the topic was called an \u201caugury\u201d and dates back to 2022.

The resolution represents the most recent effort among various government initiatives worldwide aimed at influencing the development of AI. The resolution \u2014 initiated by the United States and backed by 123 countries, including China \u2014 was unanimously adopted on March 2, signifying widespread support across all 193 U.N. member nations. The resolution encourages countries to safeguard human rights, protect personal data, and monitor AI for risks. While many AI initiatives lack enforceability, concerns persist regarding the technology\u2019s potential to disrupt democratic systems, exacerbate fraudulent activities, or result in significant job displacements, among other potential negative impacts. The resolution states: \u201cThe improper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems ... pose risks that could ... undercut the protection, promotion and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d Unlike Security Council resolutions, those from the U.N. General Assembly are not legally binding, serving instead as indicators of global sentiment. This resolution urges various entities, including nations, to foster regulatory frameworks for secure AI systems. The resolution seeks to bridge the digital gap between affluent nations and less affluent developing ones, ensuring their inclusion in AI discussions. It also strives to equip developing countries with the necessary technology and skills to leverage AI advantages, such as disease detection, flood prediction, agricultural support and workforce training. In November, the United States, the United Kingdom and over a dozen other nations made a comprehensive global pact outlining measures to safeguard AI from malicious actors. The agreement emphasizes the need for tech companies to develop AI systems with inherent security features.

However, European Union lawmakers granted ultimate approval to the world\u2019s inaugural comprehensive AI regulations on March 13. Following some procedural steps, these rules are anticipated to become operational by May or June. The EU regulations prohibit several technologies, including biometric surveillance, social scoring systems, predictive policing, \u201cemotion recognition\u201d and untargeted facial recognition systems. The White House also aimed to mitigate AI risks for consumers, workers and minorities while enhancing national security through a new executive order issued in October.

In a March 20 order, San Diego federal court Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro denied Silvergate\u2019s June dismissal motion, finding the class group adequately alleged Silvergate knew of FTX\u2019s fraud but benefited from it and unjustly enriched itself at the expense of FTX users \u2014 allegations the bank denies. The court found Silvergate owed a duty of care to FTX customers as its Silvergate Exchange Network \u2014 created to help move funds to crypto exchanges \u2014 was largely for the benefit of FTX customers and \u201cthat a crypto exchange like FTX was virtually impossible before the SEN.\u201d Silvergate banked both FTX and Alameda and \u201cprocessed transfers and accepted deposits that sent FTX customer money to Alameda,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cFTX did not initially have a bank account, so customers were directed to wire money to Alameda\u2019s account.\u201d \u201cSilvergate had a strong incentive to continue accepting FTX and Alameda customer deposits and executing transfers because Silvergate\u2019s business centered around the adoption of the FTX exchange platform and app.\u201d \u201cIt was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,\u201d the order said. Silvergate made income from the translation fees and interest deposited into FTX-related accounts. The order claims Silvergate\u2019s annual income before FTX was $7.6 million \u2014 jumping to $75.5 million after it banked the exchange. The order said in Silvergate\u2019s dismissal motion that the bank claimed it didn\u2019t owe FTX customers a duty of care as its dealings alleged by the lawsuit \u201cwas not a substantial factor\u201d in FTX customers\u2019 inability to withdraw funds \u2014 that was instead the fault of FTX and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

Three separate class actions against Silvergate were combined in April. Silvergate collapsed about a month later, in March 2023, just months after FTX had fallen into bankruptcy in November 2022. Bankman-Fried was found guilty last November on seven charges relating to various fraud and money laundering. His sentencing date is set for March 28.

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s (GBTC) March 21 net outflows of $358.8 million follows a massive week of outflows, with its $642 million on March 18 being the largest day on record, per Farside Investors data. The latest figures bring this week\u2019s total outflows for GBTC to $1.8 billion and mark the fourth consecutive day of net outflows across all 10 Bitcoin ETFs. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated in a March 21 X post that much of Grayscale\u2019s outflows could soon draw to a close, with the majority of them coming from bankruptcies of crypto firms due to their \u201csize and consistency.\u201d \u201cAny Gemini/Genisis outflows likely buying BTC [with] cash hence market holding up,\u201d said Balchunas. \u201cTakeaway: the worst is [probably] close to being over. Once it is, only retail will be left and flows should look more like the Feb trickle,\u201d he added. As of March 21, Grayscale reported that its Bitcoin Trust held a total of $23.2 billion in assets under management. GBTC has shed $13.6 billion since being converted to an ETF on Jan. 11.

On March 22, general partner of Van Buren Capital and finance lawyer Scott Johnsson offered his opinion on why the SEC may have reportedly launched its probe into Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation. One of the theories, according to Johnsson, is that the SEC could be using the probe to placate crypto skeptics who have demanded a tougher stance from the agency. Earlier this month, Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler urged SEC Chair Gary Gensler not to allow any further spot crypto ETF approvals. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also been extremely vocal in her disapproval of these investment products. Another theory, which has gained more traction on X lately, is that the SEC could be using it as a way to deny spot Ether ETFs \u2014 as a non-correlation objection may not hold up. \u201cThe SEC needs a non-correlation objection to deny ETH spot ETFs this year,\u201d said Johnsson. The crypto lawyer explains that denying spot ETH ETFs solely based on correlation analysis may be a temporary solution, as correlation levels are improving over time. Correlation describes the difference between the prices on spot markets and futures and has been a key argument for the SEC for approving or denying crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). However, earlier this month, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the \u201ccorrelations between futures and spot isn\u2019t as strong\u201d before adding that he was \u201cnot nearly as optimistic here vs BTC ETFs.\u201d Finally, Johnsson believes the probe would also help the SEC thread a needle: deny spot Ethereum ETFs while avoiding \u201cundermining the arguments\u201d in its legal action against Coinbase and Binance. In June 2023, the SEC accused Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities, naming 19 tokens. However, ETH was not among them. In an interview with Bloomberg TV earlier this month, the SEC\u2019s Gensler was asked directly about the status of ETH as a security, to which he replied with his usual vagueness, without answering the question. Ultimately, the SEC could end up pursuing a \u201csoft approach\u201d by claiming an ongoing investigation into ETH\u2019s security status rather than making a definitive enforcement action, he postulated. \u201cWe find motivation in the present for the SEC to further an investigation into ETH security status as an additional pretense to deny approval,\u201d he stated. \u201cCould the SEC go full scorched earth? Absolutely, but I\u2019ll still hold my breath for the moment. I\u2019ve heard reasonable arguments that this might be the case, so be warned.\u201d Related: Coinbase argues for spot Ether ETFs as analysts warn of \u2018concentration risk\u2019 ETF Store president Nate Geraci said that the best time for the SEC to argue that ETH was a security was before it approved Ethereum futures trading in October 2023, but they didn\u2019t do that. \u201cAlso too late to make a correlation argument IMO,\u201d he said before adding, \u201cIf ok with grandma buying ETH futures ETF, then why not spot?\u201d In response to the reported SEC Ethereum probe, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal argued, \u201cThe SEC has no good reason to deny the ETH ETP applications.\u201d He added, \u201cWe hope they won\u2019t try to invent one by questioning the long-established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed.\u201d On March 21, U.S. Congressperson Patrick McHenry commented on the SEC\u2019s move against Ethereum, stating, \u201cThis is contrary to the CFTC\u2019s assessment and the SEC\u2019s prior actions,\u201d before adding: \u201cCongress decides the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction and budget, Chair Gensler doesn\u2019t get to make it up as he goes along.\u201d Magazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?","tags":"#Security, #Ethereum, #SEC, #ETF, #Regulation, #Gary Gensler"},{"date":"Mar 22, 2024","summary":"","author":"Brayden Lindrea","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-dca-strategy-extreme-greed-most-profitable","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Backtested DCA strategy suggests selling Bitcoin at \u2018extreme greed\u2019 most profitable","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Selling off a portion of Bitcoin (BTC) when the market is in a state of \u201cextreme greed\u201d is a more profitable investment strategy than just buying and hodling it, a Redditor\u2019s analysis suggests.

The issue could be the reason why many crypto-based apps today offer only limited functionality on iOS devices. \u201cApple\u2019s anticompetitive conduct not only limits competition in the smartphone market, but also reverberates through the industries that are affected by these restrictions, including financial services.\u201d Apple policies have ousted alternative payment systems \u201cin ways that were anticompetitive and exclusionary,\u201d the DOJ said. It also highlighted the 30% Apple tax, a fee the company charges for apps and in-app payments whose \u201ccontent, product, or service it did not create.\u201d The fee and Apple payment systems are fiat-compatible only and have walled off the use of crypto in apps or made it not economically viable for a crypto-based app to offer in-app purchases. Apple offers \u201dcertain enterprise and public sector customers\u201d the ability to offer their own apps through custom app stores, but iPhone users and developers are restricted from such alternative app stores, as they would compete with the Big Tech player\u2019s fees, the DOJ said. \u201cApple often enforces its App Store rules arbitrarily. And it frequently uses App Store rules and restrictions to penalize and restrict developers that take advantage of technologies that threaten to disrupt, disintermediate, compete with, or erode Apple\u2019s monopoly power.\u201d Some nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, such as OpenSea, have disabled functionality on their iOS apps as NFT sales are subject to the 30% fee.

While most other encrypted messaging apps require phone numbers to sign up, Status allows users to sign up to the platform using crypto wallet addresses. However, Status has been at least six years in the making, as it first launched during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in July 2017, raising a staggering $100 million for its native SNT token in less than 24 hours. The project garnered later criticism for being slow to bring a working product to market. In April 2020, the project\u2019s leadership, CEO Jarrad Hope and chief communications officer, Carl Bennetts, were named as individual defendants in a class-action lawsuit \u2014 which declared the sale of the SNT token as being an unregistered securities offering. Fast forward to Nov. 8, 2023, however, and the project has announced the launch of upcoming alpha and beta versions of its app over the coming months. In a Nov. 8 blog post, Status addressed some of the community\u2019s concerns with its development \u2014 saying that its initial vision of creating a consumer-facing super app had \u201cproved overly optimistic.\u201d Related: TON blockchain launches $115M community incentive program Status cited several reasons for development hiccups, including scalability challenges that saw it abandon its \u201cWhisper\u201d protocol, as well as being forced to lay off staff during the 2018 crypto market crash. However, the resurgence of development activity and an uptick in crypto prices beginning in late 2022 saw the firm regain its footing. \u201cThe 2022 bull market endowed us with the financial wherewithal needed to execute Status\u2019 updated strategy, so the next step was to scale the org back up to the resource level required to realize our ambitious vision,\u201d wrote the Status team. The project\u2019s native SNT token is currently changing hands for $0.04, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours and roughly 50% over the last year. SNT remains down 93.4% from its all-time high of $0.68, which it notched on Jan. 3, 2018, per CoinGecko data.

In under a month, Bitcoin miners face the reality of reduced block rewards, which is anticipated to significantly impact profitability and income. Bitcoin mining CEOs told Cointelegraph that the efficiency and scale of mining operations will be critically important as firms clamber for a share of the reduced rewards. Marathon Digital, considered one of the largest mining firms in North America, is among the players that have long been planning for the halving. The firm\u2019s chief growth officer, Adam Swick, told Cointelegraph the halving will be a test to reveal the most efficient and well-funded entities. \u201cWhile the immediate effect is reduced rewards and profitability, these companies are typically more resilient, given their greater access to capital and efficient operations,\u201d Swick explained, warning that smaller operations that are marginally profitable might not survive the halving at all. The importance of operational efficiency, balance sheet management and capital structure for miners will also come to the front, according to OceanBit co-founder Michael Bennet. \u201cMiners with debt burden and maturing securities will sell opportunistically as we continue to break all-time highs to reduce their debt service during the post-halving cycle when the competition becomes more fierce and operational efficiency becomes king,\u201d Bennet said. History also plays a role, as miners have had four years to forecast and plan how to manage operations. Stronghold Digital Mining CEO Greg Beard noted that previous halvings forced mining companies to adapt to lower-margin environments. As profitability margins are reduced, Beard said miners must sell BTC to pay for more efficient miners: \u201cI expect some Bitcoin miners will feel pressure to convert BTC to cash to continue to show growth.\u201d Swick made a similar prediction, noting that Bitcoin\u2019s new all-time high may temporarily increase profitability due to higher transaction fees and the subsequent demand for mining services but will later put pressure on it instead. \u201cIf miners have not developed sufficient resources to weather the halving, we\u2019ll likely see some organizations sell off their BTC reserves, or even divest from operation sites in extreme cases, in order to maintain capital,\u201d Swick said. The Bitcoin halving is hardwired into the blockchain\u2019s code. Every 210,000 blocks mined, which takes four years on average, sees the block reward paid to miners slashed in half. What started at 50 BTC per block mined in 2009 will become 3.125 BTC when the fourth halving occurs in April 2024. The network is also the most competitive it has ever been, with considerable hashing power competing for block rewards. Stronghold\u2019s CEO said the situation may change as less efficient miners face the reality of less profitability: \u201cI expect the hash rate will fall post-halving as less efficient machines are unplugged. The question is, what will be the extent of this decline?\u201d Marathon\u2019s chief growth officer added that the build-up to the halving has provided ample opportunity to obtain capacity. In December, Marathon announced it would acquire two operational Bitcoin mining sites from Generate Capital, with the deal to be completed in early 2024. Marathon said the deal would reduce its cost of mining a single BTC by 30%. Stronghold\u2019s CEO added that the build-up to the halving has already led to a \u201cquartering of mining economics\u201d led by miners adding capacity to their machinery without the price of Bitcoin appreciating in lock-step. $SDIG CEO Greg Beard recently joined @mattxmccoy's podcast to chat about the biggest misconception in the #Bitcoin mining industry - in under 60 seconds.

What\u2019s yours? pic.twitter.com/f1mFUlCuiE \u2014 Stronghold Digital Mining (NASDAQ:SDIG) (@Stronghold_DM) February 21, 2024 \u201cThe recent ETF approval supports the more recent run-up in Bitcoin price and has furthered the existing supply/demand imbalance, so miners who can keep costs low are set to win out the halving as Bitcoin price increases,\u201d Beard said. Miners are under no illusion about the reality of decreased block rewards and the potential impact of profitability. Yet there seems to be an air of confidence from industry players. Related: Energy-efficient miners in US less likely to be impacted by Bitcoin halving Swick predicts a significant consolidation within the Bitcoin mining world, stemming from profitability concerns and the potential need to sell off sites. He also expects to see the development of technologically advanced mining hardware and large operation sites being built and improved energy harvesting solutions that allow miners to subsidize costs. \u201cMining will likely become increasingly decentralized as miners seek unique stranded energy assets and situations where they can be a value-add to energy producers, rather than just a customer.\u201d Bennet, meanwhile, predicts a significant upside for the price of BTC, reflecting directly on the impact of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds driving record levels of demand for Bitcoin. He highlighted that BlackRock and Fidelity alone have accumulated an average of 5,000 BTC per day in the nine weeks since Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the United States: \u201cAs the daily issuance of new Bitcoin decreases from 900 to 450 with the halving, assuming global demand stays constant or increases, we\u2019ll see continued growth in the price of Bitcoin.\u201d Bitcoin was trading at $65,000 with a total market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, ranking it as the 10th most valuable asset worldwide at the time of publication. Institutional interest driven by the investments of Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation of the halving are macro-forces that make Stronghold\u2019s CEO optimistic. \u201cWe must remember that we are still in the early stages of Bitcoin adoption,\u201d Beard said.

It still has to pass a parliamentary vote. Under the legislation, the providers would be subject to the supervision of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA). Currently, cryptocurrency service providers are registered by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and are required to conform to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. The FSA would begin issuing licenses in 2025, and holders of FIU licenses would have to apply for FSA licensing before the end of that year. Estonian Finance Minister Mart V√µrklaev said: \u201cI believe that anyone who takes this seriously and wishes to provide a service will also be able to obtain a new license from the Financial Supervisory Authority.\" Under national law, fines for AML violations top out at 40,000 euros ($43,450). Under the new law, fines of up to 5 million euros ($5.2 million) will be possible. V√µrklaev announced that he had sent the bill, which has not been translated into English, to the government last week. The bill has to be approved by the government before it goes before the Riigikogu, the unicameral Estonian parliament, for a vote. Related: Estonian government will allow extradition of Hashflare defendants The bill would bring Estonia into conformity with the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. It would also change the securities prospectus requirement. While previously, companies wishing to raise capital in the form of shares or bonds worth more than 5 million euros had to prepare a detailed prospectus \u2014 a slow and expensive undertaking \u2014 now the threshold would be raised to 8 million euros ($86.9 million). Estonia positioned itself as crypto-friendly in 2017, when it passed legislation with advantageous laws for crypto firms and easy registration, including e-residency. It cracked down on crypto firms in 2020 after a large-scale corruption scandal unrelated to crypto broke out in the country. In 2020, Estonia revoked 500 FIU-issued crypto company licenses for failing to launch in the country within six months of registration. After months of police scrutiny, the number of crypto firms licensed in Estonia fell from 1,234 at the end of 2019 to 353 in September 2020. In October 2021, the FIU considered revoking all crypto company licenses and relicensing the businesses. It imposed stricter AML requirements at the end of 2021. After that law was amended in 2023, almost 400 virtual asset providers were either shut down or closed voluntarily.

According to the request, the appellate court violated procedure in rejecting an appeal from Kwon\u2019s legal team. It argued only the Supreme Court had the authority to adopt a legal decision in the case. Montenegrin courts have been weighing whether to grant extradition of Kwon to the United States or South Korea, where he could face criminal charges related to his role in the downfall of Terraform Labs.

The platform has already made waves in the crypto sphere, particularly after crypto influencer Ben Armstrong listed his inscriptions, which drove multifold growth for his group members who hold the exclusive ordinals. The inception of cryptocurrencies was fundamentally about shifting financial power back into the hands of individuals, offering autonomy and control unprecedented in traditional finance. Central to realizing this transformative vision is the role of vibrant and active communities. Communities are not just peripheral supporters; they are catalysts for wider adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into daily life. Through community-driven initiatives, knowledge about innovative applications and insights into fluctuating market trends are disseminated more broadly and effectively. Moreover, in the realm of decentralized projects, communities aren't just audiences but active participants. They engage in governance, wielding collective power to steer projects via democratic processes. Beyond governance, communities foster a supportive network, providing invaluable resources for education, troubleshooting and sharing experiences. The strength of such community networks is crucial in ensuring the dynamism and inclusivity of broader crypto ecosystems. Recognizing the importance of communities, Phemex \u2014 a crypto trading platform \u2014 introduced PhemexPulse, a social trading feature designed to foster decentralized, community-driven innovation by integrating with the Phemex Web3 ecosystem. PhemexPulse aims to create a space where traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts can connect, share insights and leverage their digital presence for potential earnings. The social trading feature comes with a model where both followers and content creators, such as influencers and key opinion leaders (KOLs), can earn rewards. Influencers, including Ben Armstrong have already established groups on the platform and listed their ordinals.  Users can become group owners and earn rewards with their followers on PhemexPulse.

Daily activities on the platform, such as messaging, trading and making referrals, are converted into a points-based reward system. Group owners and their followers can all earn points through straightforward actions that are a natural part of their everyday online experiences. A key feature of PhemexPulse is its scoring system, which translates social media engagement into tangible rewards. While points are earned through various activities on the platform, users can convert their points into a competitive allocation of Phemex Tokens (PTs) three times each day. The scoring system is designed to encourage consistent engagement from users, offering them a pathway to earn crypto as a reward for their contributions to the platform. PhemexPulse also houses an Inscription Marketplace, which allows users to trade and collect exclusive digital assets like inscriptions and ordinals that are tied to notable figures in the crypto world. The marketplace serves as a venue for economic activity and fosters a sense of community among followers and their preferred KOLs.  The dashboard of PhemexPulse\u2019s Inscription Marketplace.

Owing to their scarcity and the vibrant engagement fostered by the platform, these ordinals, priced at 1 PT per mint initially, experienced a 7296% surge in value within hours of their launch. They sustained this growth trajectory, achieving a new all-time high (ATH) of 115 PT on March 20, which marks an additional 56% increase following its initial ATH and an overall growth of 11,400%. A user who initially minted 10 inscriptions on the first day, accruing 10 PT, now boasts 1000 PT \u2014 a tenfold increase achieved within a week. Phemex emphasizes its dedication to building a vibrant and engaging community, which serves as the cornerstone for its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia. The ecosystem has already attracted more than 30,000 members, highlighting its appeal within the crypto community. The introduction of PhemexPulse aims to enrich the user experience and improve community involvement, as underlined by Stella Chan, chief operating officer of Phemex: \u201cThe remarkable performance of Ben Armstrong's inscriptions, which have significantly appreciated in value for their holders, underscores the powerful combination of influence and engagement within the crypto ecosystem \u2014 principles at the heart of PhemexPulse. The surge of activity we witnessed in just over a week post-launch affirms our direction in fostering dynamic communities that are committed, interactive and rewarded.

Huang\u2019s comments came during a speech at the Nvidia GTC developers conference in San Jose, California, on March 20. During the event\u2019s keynote speech, Huang addressed the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI). According to a report from TechCrunch, the CEO told reporters that the arrival of AGI was an issue of benchmarking: \u201cIf we specified AGI to be something very specific, a set of tests where a software program can do very well \u2014 or maybe 8% better than most people \u2014 I believe we will get there within 5 years.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of tests Huang was referring to. The term \u201cgeneral\u201d in the context of artificial intelligence typically refers to a system that, regardless of the benchmark, is capable of anything a human of average intelligence could do given sufficient resources. He also went on to discuss \u201challucinations,\u201d an unintended result of training large language models to act as generative AI systems. Hallucinations occur when AI models output new, usually incorrect, information that isn\u2019t contained in its data set. According to Huang, solving hallucinations should be a simple matter. \u201cAdd a rule: For every single answer, you have to look up the answer,\u201d he told audience members before adding, \u201cThe AI shouldn\u2019t just answer; it should do research first to determine which of the answers are the best.\u201d Setting aside the fact that Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot AI, Google\u2019s Gemini, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 all feature the ability to provide sources for their outputs from the internet, if AI\u2019s hallucination problem were to be solved once and for all, it could revolutionize myriad industries including finance and crypto. Currently, the makers of the aforementioned systems advise caution when using generative AI systems for functions where accuracy is important. The user interface for ChatGPT, for example, warns that \u201cChatGPT can make mistakes,\u201d and advises users to \u201cconsider checking important information.\u201d In the world of finance and cryptocurrency, accuracy can spell the difference between profit and loss. This means, under the current status quo, generative AI systems have limited functionality for finance and crypto professionals. Related: CFTC warns AI cannot pick your next crypto winner While experiments involving trading bots powered by generative AI systems exist, they\u2019re usually hardbound by rules to prevent autonomous execution \u2014 meaning they\u2019re preprogrammed to execute trades in a tightly controlled manner similar to placing limit orders. If generative AI models didn\u2019t suffer from hallucinating entirely fabricated outputs, then, ostensibly, they should be capable of conducting trades and making financial recommendations and decisions entirely independently of human input. In other words, if the problem of hallucinations in AI was solved, it\u2019s possible fully automated trading would become a reality.","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #Google, #NVidia, #Business, #Bot, #Microsoft, #AI, #Trading, #ChatGPT, #OpenAI"},{"date":"Mar 21, 2024","summary":"","author":"Marcel Pechman","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/solana-price-wavers-but-increased-dapp-activity-points-to-sol-recovery","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Solana price wavers, but increased DApp activity points to SOL recovery","type":"Blog","category":"Altcoin Watch","content":"Solana\u2019s native token, SOL (SOL), experienced a 45% surge over a week, hitting a high of $210 on March 18.

This performance surpasses that of Ether (ETH) and Avalanche\u2019s AVAX (AVAX), which have increased by 12% and 30%, respectively, during the same period. Solana remains firmly in place as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the third in terms of total value locked (TVL), making a long-term bearish outlook on SOL\u2019s price difficult to support. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t assure that SOL\u2019s price will stay above $165 in the short term, so investors should examine on-chain metrics to see if the bullish trend is likely to persist. The view that SOL\u2019s 18% drop since March 18 has reversed the bullish trend is challenged by the fact that SOL\u2019s price dipped below $165 for less than an hour on March 20, showing significant support. With Bitcoin (BTC) unable to maintain above $70,000, leading to speculation of an altcoin season, both bullish and bearish arguments have their merits. Critics highlight that the increased demand for Solana led to relatively high fees and more failed transactions. On March 16, data from Cointelegraph indicated that validators experienced delays of up to 40 seconds, causing nearly half of the transactions to fail within a 20-minute span. This rise in activity was spurred by a memecoin frenzy, notably marked by the launch of Book of Meme (BOME), which attracted a remarkable $270 million in trading volume within its first 24 hours. After Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork on March 13, which reduced fees for its layer-2 scalability solutions, competition among memecoin launches intensified. This upgrade led to a surge in Ethereum\u2019s Base activity, with a 77% increase in decentralized application (DApp) volume in a week, as reported by DappRadar. Consequently, the Ethereum ecosystem has become more competitive for memecoin launches, potentially diminishing the focus and spending power of Solana users. Although it\u2019s challenging to pinpoint the direct cause and effect, Solana SPL memecoins seemed to have hit their peak the day following the Ethereum network\u2019s upgrade on March 14. Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk experienced drops of 38% and 40%, respectively. Despite these setbacks, the Solana network has greatly benefited from the heightened activity, with an increase in both volume and active addresses engaging with its DApps. Notice the Solana network\u2019s volume has surged by 55% since March 13, significantly outpacing competitors like BNB Chain and Polygon, which have only seen gains of 2% and 7%, respectively, during the same timeframe. However, the increased activity and volume from memecoins and new token launches do not necessarily guarantee sustained price increases, regardless of the project\u2019s merits. Related: How low can the Bitcoin price go? This was evident with the liquid staking project Jito (JTO), which saw a 20% drop over two days after reaching a high of $3.85 on March 18. In a similar vein, the decentralized exchange Jupiter\u2019s JUP token has fallen 25.5% from its all-time high of $1.60 on the same day. Despite the level of adoption these projects may have, a downturn in SOL\u2019s price impacts the entire Solana ecosystem. Analysts point out that the significant issuance of tokens to cover Solana\u2019s substantial validator costs, effectively inflating the supply of SOL, is a major concern. Additionally, the large volume of tokens held by the bankrupt FTX exchange\u2019s estate poses a sell-off risk in the near future. Despite these factors, Solana\u2019s DApp activity growth suggests no apparent weaknesses, indicating that the $165 support level should hold in the near term.

On March 8, Immutable announced that it had onboarded 75 Web3 games in the last three months. This brings the total number of blockchain-based games on Immutable to 270. With its gaming ecosystem showing significant growth, the crypto exchange has OKX capitalized and moved into Web3 gaming through Immutable. Jason Lau, the chief innovation officer of crypto exchange OKX, said the exchange has partnered with Immutable to expand the Web3 gaming ecosystem further. Lau told Cointelegraph that Web3 has a lot to bring to improve gamers\u2019 experiences, including enabling true ownership and \u201cdriving innovation\u201d in gaming. He explained that Web3 lets gamers own, trade and earn from their assets in-game, enhancing the experience. He said it also \u201cencourages unique game mechanics, business models and community involvement.\u201d According to Lau, OKX and Immutable are working on a GameFi launchpad, which could keep the Web3 gaming adoption momentum going. The launchpad will support gaming launches on Immutable\u2019s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) chain. When asked how the crypto community will benefit from the collaboration, Lau said the upcoming launchpad would help improve discoverability and access to upcoming Web3 games, experiences and assets. Games launching on the Immutable chain will be able to access a suite of OKX solutions, including its exchange, wallet and nonfungible token marketplace. Furthermore, the OKX Wallet service will be integrated with Immutable Passport, a login method developed by the Web3 game publisher for games within its ecosystem. As the two organizations provide tools for Web3 gaming firms, Lau believes blockchain gaming firms have a role in onboarding gamers into Web3. He urged gaming projects to prioritize making game mechanics unique. Lau explained: \u201cGames must be fun, engaging and of high-quality to attract and build a sustainable community. By experimenting with what Web3 uniquely enables, we hope to see games that break free from the existing Web2 game mold.\u201d In addition, Lau highlighted that blockchain gaming firms must focus on cultivating their communities around each game. The executive said that apart from promoting games, the gaming companies should also educate players on the benefits of Web3. Related: Immutable launches \u2018Passport\u2019 wallet infrastructure with Google or Apple login Immutable has been improving its gaming ecosystem by adding features that make Web3 gaming easier for players. On Dec. 13, 2023, the blockchain platform announced its proprietary zero-knowledge proof scaling platform called zkEVM. This lets game developers remove gas fees for users, allowing a more \u201cfrictionless\u201d onboarding for Web3 gamers. Immutable also launched its passport wallet infrastructure on Dec. 19. The feature allows users to create and recover their wallets using a Google or Apple account. The service aims to help Web3 gamers by making account management more convenient for players.

Powered by Phemex, the timeline allows crypto community members to explore and look back at the important events that shaped the industry into what it is today. Explore the History of Crypto This article explores the pivotal years from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the global context and challenges when the enigmatic and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto made their appearance. The journey starts from the creation of the Bitcoin protocol and continues by outlining other significant milestones in the early days of the digital currency space and the emergence of alternative coins, commonly known as altcoins. This period sets the foundational stage for the innovation and diversification that will characterize the future of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Cryptocurrency as it is known today first surfaced on Oct. 31, 2008, when the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, sent an email with a white paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d to a cypherpunk mailing list where members discussed cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a tool for social and political change. At the time, the world was in the thick of the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis, one of the most severe worldwide economic crises in recent decades. The event has been attributed to the excessive risk-taking of international financial institutions, a build-up of toxic assets within banks, and the bursting of the United States housing bubble. The crisis came to a head on Sept. 15, 2008, when the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. This eventually led to crises in national economies worldwide during what became known as the \u201cGreat Recession.\u201d On Oct. 31, 2008, Nakamoto emailed the cypherpunk mailing list and wrote about an electronic cash system that would be \u201cfully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third-party,\u201d and shared the Bitcoin white paper. The paper merged existing cryptographic concepts with distributed ledger technology and introduced a decentralized system independent of central authorities. At the time, the recipients could have had no idea that this project would pave the way for an entire cryptocurrency industry worth $3 trillion at its peak in 2021. On Jan. 3, 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain went live when Nakamoto mined the genesis block and embedded a message that read: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d The message referenced a similar headline published by The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom on the same date. Many interpreted the message as a comment on the instability brought about by traditional finance. Days later, Nakamoto sent an email announcing the first version of Bitcoin. On Jan. 9, 2009, the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator explained the basics of Bitcoin, including how to mine and send coins. Nakamoto also explained the total supply of Bitcoin and touched upon what became known as the Bitcoin halving. On Jan. 12, 2009, the world\u2019s first Bitcoin transaction took place when Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to the American programmer Hal Finney. Finney was a regular poster on the cypherpunk mailing list and was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin. Fast forward to 2010, events like the iconic Bitcoin Pizza Day and the establishment of the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange happened. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz offered 10,000 Bitcoin for two large pizzas at the BitcoinTalk online forum. Jeremy Sturdivant took up Hanyecz\u2019s offer and delivered the meal in exchange for the Bitcoin. This marked the first real-world transaction for the currency. On July 17, 2010, the Mt. Gox exchange was launched. Programmer Jed McCaleb announced the creation of the exchange on the BitcoinTalk forum. The exchange provided a platform for users to trade their BTC and paved the way for future exchanges. In 2011, Bitcoin had a massive win and a loss at the same time. On Feb. 9, 2011, Bitcoin\u2019s price hit $1 for the first time at Mt. Gox, validating the currency value as a new financial asset. However, several months later, Nakamoto sent out his last verified communication. On April 26, 2011, Nakamoto had an email exchange with Gavin Andresen, a key figure in the early BTC community who took over Bitcoin development in December 2010. Within the email, Nakamoto expressed the desire to move on to other projects, stepping away from direct involvement with the development of Bitcoin. This marked the end of Nakamoto\u2019s known interactions with the Bitcoin community. After Nakamoto\u2019s departure, one of the most significant developments was the emergence of altcoins. On Oct. 7, 2011, Charlie Lee released Litecoin through an open-source client on the developer platform GitHub. The network itself went live on Oct. 13. In 2012, two critical moments happened: Crypto exchange Coinbase launched, and the XRP (XRP) cryptocurrency was created. While Bitcoin needs a mining process to create new coins, all XRP tokens have existed since its launch, and no new tokens have been minted since. While it might not have been obvious to community members at the time, the events of the early years impacted the broader adoption of the technology. From the creation of Bitcoin to Nakamoto\u2019s departure, these events will be remembered in history as cornerstones paving the way for a new asset class. Stay tuned for the next article in the History of Crypto series, where Bitcoin\u2019s expansion and Ethereum's early development are explored.

On March 21, blockchain security firm CertiK flagged an account linked to the $24 million hack transferring 3,700 ETH to Tornado Cash. The funds were taken from a crypto whale in a phishing incident on Sept. 6, 2023. At the time, the investor lost $24 million in staked ETH on the liquid staking provider Rocket Pool. The hack was done in two transactions: one took 9,579 stETH, while the other drained 4,851 rETH from the crypto whale. Scam Sniffer, an anti-scam project, said that the victim signed an \u201cIncrease Allowance\u201d transaction, which enabled token approvals for the hacker. With smart contracts, the feature allows third parties to spend ERC-20 tokens belonging to others if given approval. The token allowances feature has been talked about a lot within the crypto space, with some warning users about how developers could deploy malicious smart contracts for scams. Blockchain security company PeckShield flagged that the attacker swapped the assets for 13,785 ETH and 1.64 million Dai (DAI). Some of the DAI was transferred to the FixedFload exchange, while most of the stolen funds were moved into other wallets. Phishing attacks continue to be a huge headache for the crypto space. Scam Sniffer\u2019s crypto phishing report showed that in February, almost $47 million was lost to crypto phishing scams. The report highlighted that 78% of the thefts happened on the Ethereum network, and ERC-20 tokens took up 86% of all the assets stolen. Related: Trezor X account shills fake presale tokens in suspected hack Token approvals have also caused recent losses for crypto users. On March 20, an old contract previously used by the Dolomite exchange was used to drain $1.8 million from users. The exploit affected users who authorized approvals for the contract. Because of this, Dolomite\u2019s development team urged users to revoke approvals given to the old contract address. While some attacks lead to millions lost, some efforts to steal crypto are thwarted very quickly. On March 20, the Layerswap team prevented any further damage from a breach of its website after intervention from its domain provider. Despite this, the hackers still drained about $100,000 in assets from 50 users. The protocol said that it would refund the affected users and provide additional compensation for the inconvenience.

In Germany, cryptocurrency taxes are determined by how long an investor has held their crypto. After holding crypto for one year, private investors can realize tax-free trading profits. The one-year period was created to incentivize long-term investments and, at the same time, increase the attractiveness of Germany as a location for crypto investors. Long-term-oriented investors are thus to be supported, while speculative short-term transactions are less favored. However, the Greens believe this unique exemption period is unfair, as other financial instruments are subject to a flat 25% capital gains tax, regardless of how long investors hold them. This proposal has triggered discussions about the potential impact on investment culture, tax fairness and the administration of crypto transactions. Sabine Gr√ºtzmacher, a member of the Bundestag for the Greens, defends the proposal and argues for equal conditions for different investment options: \u201cWe are committed to equal conditions for different investment options. The capital gains tax on stock profits has existed since 2009 without a tax-free minimum holding period,\u201d she told Cointelegraph. \u201cUnder the \u2018level playing field\u2019 concept of fairness, which we agreed on in the coalition agreement, we want to create comparable conditions for all capital investment classes, including crypto assets.\u201d The Greens classify crypto tokens as capital investments, more comparable to stocks or gold and not as currency. However, \u201cdue to the extremely high volatility of the value of crypto tokens,\u201d Gr√ºtzmacher says that the party cannot recommend them for investment without significant consumer protections. Recent: Bitcoin price retraces 30 days ahead of halving in historical pattern \u201cI do not see any special incentives for tax exemption of profits after a one-year holding period,\u201d said Gr√ºtzmacher, adding that there is \u201ca need to raise awareness among young people, particularly of the existing risks, especially against the background that so-called influencers sometimes even use paid advertising to overemphasize opportunities.\u201d Gr√ºtzmacher emphasized that the Green\u2019s proposal is yet to be decided on and said that any proposal would include a cut-off date, i.e., cryptocurrency purchased before a certain date would still be eligible to be sold tax-free, even after the new law would come into effect. Not everyone agrees with the Greens\u2019 claim that crypto doesn\u2019t deserve an exemption. Ulli Spankowski, founder of the crypto trading app Bison and chief digital officer at Boerse Stuttgart Digital, told Cointelegraph the classification of crypto assets in the German tax code is clear. Under current law, crypto assets are considered \u201cother economic goods\u201d and are thus eligible for tax-free trading after one year \u2014 the same standard applies to physical gold. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d according to Spankowski. Spankowski further claimed that the one-year holding period serves as an important instrument to increase the investor base and has made Germany an attractive location for crypto investors: \u201cA possible abolition of the one-year holding period for capital gains could significantly impact the investment climate in Germany.\u201d Frank Sch√§ffler, a member of the Bundestag for the Free Democratic Party (FDP), agreed that abolishing the holding period would hamper investment culture in Germany. \u201cThe Greens\u2019 demand would further complicate our tax system. The abolition of the speculation period would mean that crypto profits would always be taxed, even if the crypto assets are held as investment objects for a long time,\u201d Sch√§ffler told Cointelegraph. According to Sch√§ffler, capital formation should be simplified, and long-term investments should be rewarded, for example, by increasing the tax exemption limit. \u201cWith the Growth Opportunities Act, we want to increase the minimal limit for private sales from 600 to 1,000 euros within one year. This law will come into force when the Union [an alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union] gives up its blocking position in the Bundesrat [the upper house of Germany\u2019s parliament.]\u201d Since the end of 2021, Germany has been governed by a coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens and the FDP, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Without the approval of the FDP and SPD, the Greens have little hope of abolishing the crypto tax exemption. Sch√§ffler said that it is unlikely that the Greens would find the necessary votes to pass the measure: \u201cThis change is not possible with the FDP. Therefore, the proposal will not be implemented either.\u201d Germany\u2019s governing coalition is experiencing a growing rift, particularly between the Greens and the FDP, significantly hindering their ability to find common ground on various policy issues. This gridlock stems from their fundamentally different ideologies: The FDP champions free markets, limited government intervention and minimal regulations, while the Greens prioritize government control, subsidies and even bans in some cases. Every new public dispute between the two parties further exacerbates the situation, making it increasingly challenging to reach sustainable compromises. Even if the Greens somehow managed to overcome political gridlock within the Bundestag, would abolishing the tax exemption have much of an impact on German markets and investing? According to Statista\u2019s Consumer Insights, 13% of 18 to 64-year-olds surveyed in Germany in 2023 use or own cryptocurrencies. Two years earlier, it was only 9%. This shows that crypto holders make up a growing share of German investors. For comparison, in 2023, nearly 18% of German investors owned shares of stocks and funds. While this shows the growing popularity of cryptocurrency among German investors over traditional financial instruments, it also highlights the overall low rate of investment in Germany compared to some of its other European neighbors. In Sweden, where investing in stocks is mandatory for retirement planning, more than 50% of the Swedish population has invested. Recent: Bitcoin halving meets unprecedented institutional demand A change in the law and complete abolition of the holding period will not create incentives to promote a more active investment culture, says Spanowski. \u201cEspecially for those investors who want to invest for the long term and provide for their old age, this is an obstacle and contradicts the fundamental political goal of promoting such investments among the population.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe government can create incentives for investors through tax breaks to encourage investment,\u201d Spankowski argued, adding that education initiatives are also crucial. Spankowki believes that promoting a sensible investment culture in Germany requires various measures to be implemented in cooperation between the government, the financial industry and educational institutions. \u201cFor banks and brokers, this means creating a simple and understandable offer for a broad mass of informed end customers to facilitate access to investment products.\u201d","tags":"#Law, #Politics, #Europe, #Adoption, #Germany, #Euro, #European Union, #Bundestag, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 21, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/trad-wall-street-firms-pushing-ether-etf-approval","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"TradFi Wall Street firms pushing for Ether ETF approval, says former Binance Labs head","type":"Blog","category":"Interview","content":"Wall Street firms and large financial institutions, not crypto natives, have the biggest interest in pushing for the approval of spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Bill Qian, chairman of Cypher Capital and former global head of fundraising at Binance Labs. \u201cNow it\u2019s not crypto natives pushing the approval of ETFs but Wall Street firms trying their best to make it happen,\u201d Qian told Cointelegraph in an interview. \u201cIn the end, the key lobbyists would be the institutional asset management companies. It is in their best interest to launch the ETF and to get the ETF approved, because they are in a game of the AUM [assets under management], and to increase their AUM, they need to get approval for the ETFs.\u201d Companies vying for a spot Ether ETF include BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has pushed its decision on VanEck\u2019s ETF application to May 23. It also postponed its decision on the Hashdex and ARK 21Shares spot Ether ETFs on March 19. Both ETF applications have a final deadline for a decision in late May. While the approval of the Ether ETF would be a welcome sign for crypto natives, large issuers have a bigger vested interest due to generating ETF-related fees, according to Qian: \u201cIt\u2019s Wall Street firms who want to make this happen to generate an ETF management fee.\u201d Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is offering the highest fee at 1.5%, followed by BlackRock and Fidelity with 0.25% and 21Shares with 0.21%. Before the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, several applicants updated their S-1 filings multiple times to lower their ETF fees, in a race to offer the lowest management fees to clients. Out of the 10 ETF issuers, Bitwise offers the lowest fees, offering ETFs with zero fees for the first six months and $1 billion in assets, followed by a 0.20% fee. According to Qian, a spot Ether ETF is \u201chighly likely\u201d to be approved this year due to demand by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with trillions of dollars in capital.

Cointelegraph spoke to Safe co-founder Lukas Schor during ETHGlobal in London to unpack why smart contract accounts and account abstraction promise to unlock Ethereum\u2019s full utility. \u201cVitalik Buterin recently put out this blog post with the three transitions we need to go through, and one of them is moving to smart accounts. That\u2019s where we see our role,\u201d Schor said. Safe, a smart wallet infrastructure provider in the Ethereum ecosystem, was initially developed as an in-house multisignature wallet by Ethereum sidechain Gnosis to manage a significant amount of Ether (ETH) raised during its initial coin offering. \u201cThey wanted to have multisig wallet, but there weren\u2019t any battled-tested ones out there at the time,\u201d Schor said. Gnosis founder Stefan George opted to build his own multisignature wallet and open-sourced it.

Safe secures over $100 billion in value across more than 7.5 million smart account addresses. Smart accounts fundamentally improve the security and user experience (UX) within the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling a broad set of functionalities that a conventional ETH wallet cannot perform. \u201cAs smart accounts are programmable accounts, they provide entirely new design spaces to solve long-lasting UX and security challenges of Ethereum, such as cross-chain interoperability and key management, fundamentally reducing the barriers of adoption,\u201d Schor elaborates. Smart account features include the ability to batch transactions, which Schor says can create more seamless decentralized application (DApp) interactions that bundle multiple on-chain actions into one single transaction. Security guarantees are another fundamental feature that makes smart accounts increasingly important. Aside from multisig functionality, the key rotation allows users to detach the signing key from an ETH wallet, enabling the exchange of the signer setup without migrating assets to a new account. Smart accounts also allow for the automation of common Web2 or traditional finance concepts like subscriptions. They can enable on-chain security features, like allow and deny lists and the ability to block interactions with malicious contracts. The functionality can also remove friction for non-Web3 natives without an ETH wallet. This means users can be onboarded using Web2 social accounts or email addresses with the option to migrate to a \u201cmore trustless setup\u201d at a later point. DApps, exchanges, layer-2 protocols and other chains are also able to sponsor gas fees, which Schor says could massively increase the user experience of Web3 interactions: \u201cThrough these advancements, I expect Web3 to become a more viable option for large brands and companies building solutions on Ethereum and regulators to be more favorable toward the industry.\u201d The adoption of smart accounts is something that Schor sees as being a \u201cfirst slowly then all at once kind of thing.\u201d The Safe co-founder highlights that their work on developing smart accounts has been ongoing for six years, which is indicative of a very gradual adoption curve. \u201cOne of the blockers of adoption is that most users still use EOA accounts [externally owned accounts], via wallets like MetaMask, so many applications and wallets optimize for this,\u201d Schor explains. He adds that layer-2 protocols have an opportunity to \u201cstart from scratch,\u201d and the recently proposed migration EIP-7377 could expedite adoption, as wallets and DApps don\u2019t have to optimize for \u201clegacy users\u201d anymore. Schor says Safe intentionally focused on specific user groups would benefit the most from additional security and flexibility of smart accounts, including Ethereum ecosystem teams and DAOs. Over time, he\u2019s witnessed adoption gradually shift more and more to less technical and lower-value use cases. Schor highlights Worldcoin\u2019s deployment of six million smart accounts as evidence of this adoption and says that 2024 could be a breakout year: \u201cI expect this year to be a tipping point, with general momentum on the builder side, mostly accelerated by ERC-4337, and even entire L2\u2019s switching to making smart accounts the default.\u201d New catalysts, like Coinbase leveraging smart accounts, the development of cross-chain smart accounts and EIP-7377, could drive the migration to smart accounts.

On March 21, CoinGecko published its 2024 report titled \u201cRise of Real World Assets in Crypto,\u201d highlighting progress in real-world assets (RWA) tokenization. CoinGecko said that in 2023, tokenized Treasurys went from $114 million in January to $845 million by the end of the year. This shows that blockchain-based digital tokens representing U.S. Treasury securities gained a 641% growth within a year. Tokenized securities are digital tokens backed by RWAs like stocks and bonds. For example, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund uses the OUSG token to represent ownership of a share of the fund and its yield. CoinGecko highlighted that asset management firm Franklin Templeton is currently the largest issuer of tokenized Treasurys. The company has issued $332 million worth of tokens with its On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund, which accounts for 38.6% of the market. Franklin Templeton is one of the 10 exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers that launched a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. in January. It is also in the race to launch an Ethereum ETF and submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 12. Apart from Franklin Templeton, other protocols featuring yield-bearing stablecoins backed by U.S. Treasury bills are also gaining in popularity. CoinGecko highlighted in the report that Mountain Protocol\u2019s USDM tokens have increased from $26,000 to $154 million since its launch in September 2023. Tokenized U.S. Treasurys are primarily based on the Ethereum network. In the report, CoinGecko noted that 57.5% of the tokens are on Ethereum. Meanwhile, companies like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree Prime have issued tokenized securities on Stellar, giving the network 39% of the market. Related: Tokenized government bonds free up liquidity in traditional financial systems While tokenized treasuries blew up in 2023, growth slowed down in 2024. In January 2024, tokenized treasuries only grew by 1.9%. As of Feb. 1, they have a market capitalization of $861 million. In addition to tokenized treasuries, CoinGecko also highlighted that commodity-backed tokens have already reached a market capitalization of $1.1 billion as of Feb. 1. Tether Gold (XAUT) and PAX Gold (PAXG) hold 83% market capitalization for tokenized precious metals. A new project has also started tokenizing uranium, allowing the redemption of the precious metal with digital tokens.

The crypto exchange cited local regulatory hurdles as the key reason behind the decision. The FIU requested the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology block the websites of the notified crypto exchanges within two weeks of the notice. After authorities blocked its website and application in January, OKX implemented a new registration process with rigorous Know Your Customer checks; however, its notice to users suggests the exchange will no longer operate in India. India remains a tricky domain for foreign crypto exchanges to navigate despite being a thriving market due to a lack of clear regulatory guidelines and strict government actions. Although discussions regarding a regulatory framework have been ongoing for almost four years, the Indian government appears to have no intention of acknowledging or subjecting the emerging crypto market to legal oversight. While there is no timeline on when India could get formal crypto regulations, the hefty 30% tax on crypto income, with no provision to offset losses along with a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on each crypto transaction, has forced several established players to shift their base elsewhere. In a recent interview, the Indian Finance Minister said they cannot treat crypto the same way as fiats, which is why the government has yet to offer a clear regulatory structure.

The ASIC aims to foster trust for crypto and decentralized financial systems by improving oversight and balancing the trilemma factors. According to the commissioner, the ASIC has provided informal regulatory assistance to over 900 entities since 2016. Speaking about the upcoming reforms, Kirkland said: \u201cIn short, our desired outcome is a clear set of rules that maintain market integrity and mitigate the risks to consumers and investors \u2013 backed by mechanisms that promote compliance with these rules and enable us to enforce them effectively.\u201d The ASIC also received numerous proposals for tokenizing financial products and other \u201creal world\u201d assets. \u201cSome types of tokenization will be regulated through the current regulatory regime, while others will be regulated through the Government\u2019s digital asset platform proposal,\u201d Kirkland added.

However, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes the SEC may have changed its mind on Ether\u2019s security status after Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022. But Quintenz argued the SEC would have factored the Ethereum Merge into its decision to approve the Ether futures ETFs as the former event occurred before the latter. If Ether were a security, it would mean CFTC-listed Ether futures ETFs would be illegal, as any derivative of Ether would be considered a securities futures contract and thus be subject to different rules, Quintenz explained. \u201cIt will be interesting to watch what, if any, excuse the SEC uses if it were to delay or deny an ETH ETF, given it has already informed the market on ETH being outside its jurisdiction,\u201d added Quintenz.

On March 20, core Ethereum developer Eric Connor and former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO Mariano Conti unveiled a new website called Pump The Gas to raise the Ethereum gas limit from 30 million to 40 million, which they say will reduce transaction fees on layer 1. \u201cThis can result in a 15% to 33% reduction in layer-1 transaction fees,\u201d said Connor in a March 19 post on X before adding, \u201cWe are calling on solo stakers, client teams, pools, and community members to help.\u201d The #pumpthegas hashtag has already started to gain some support from Ethereum users, stakers and decentralized finance (DeFi) investors on X. Conti also observed that a Rocket Pool validator had proposed a block with a 40-million gas limit on March 20. The call to increase the Ethereum gas limit has gained momentum over the last few months. In January, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested that the gas limit be upped from 30 million, where it has been since August 2021, to 40 million. Base contributor Jesse Pollak said in response that he was \u201cstrongly in support\u201d of increasing the Ethereum gas limit to 40 million or 45 million. \u201cWe have the network headroom and will be beneficial for all parties,\u201d he added. The Ethereum gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas spent on executing transactions or smart contracts in each block. Gas is the Ether (ETH) fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a smart contract on the network. The website explained that each operation has a predefined gas cost, and contracts have a gas limit they cannot exceed during execution. This prevents malicious contracts from overloading the network with infinite loops or excessive resource consumption. \u201cRaising the gas block limit 33% gives Layer 1 Ethereum the ability to process 33% more transaction load in a day,\u201d it stated. It also stated that data blobs, introduced in the Dencun upgrade with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, help greatly reduce layer-2 transaction fees but not layer-1 fees. \u201cA combination of blobs and gas limit increase can help scale both L1 and L2 Ethereum,\u201d it added. Related: Ethereum devs air concern over Vitalik\u2019s plan to increase gas limit However, not all are in favor of this network adjustment. Venture investor and Ethereum advocate Evan Van Ness said, \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of raising mainnet gas limit *today* as EIP-4844 just raised the block size,\u201d in a post on X. Earlier this year, Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden expressed concern about the proposed raise arguing that it would increase the size of the blockchain state, which contains account balances and smart contract data. Size is not the issue, he said at the time before stating, \u201cAccessing and modifying it will become slower and slower,\u201d and adding that there are \u201cno concrete solutions yet for state growth.\u201d Other downsides of increasing the gas limit include increased loads on hardware and the potential risk of network spam and attacks.

Pr√≥spera, the Bitcoin (BTC)-loving special economic zone on the Honduran island Roat√°n, named after the United States company building it, has been seeking $10.8 billion in compensation from the Honduran government after a legislation change in 2022 killed the island\u2019s special status. The fight has been taking place in the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). However, in a March 19 open letter, economists from Progressive International \u2014 which describes itself as being on a \u201cmission to unite, organize and mobilize the world\u2019s progressive forces\u201d \u2014 said Honduras\u2019 February withdrawal from the international court was a \u201ccritical defense of Honduran democracy.\u201d Pr√≥spera brought its case before ICSID in late 2022, claiming Honduras owes it billions for breaking a \u201c50-year legal stability guarantee it made\u201d after the government repealed laws in April 2022 affecting the legal certainty of the crypto island\u2019s special economic zone status and its investments. In the open letter, the economists said there was little evidence to show that governments benefit from the arbitration body. \u201cWe find scant economic evidence that mechanisms like ICSID stimulate meaningful foreign direct investment,\u201d the economists state in the letter. \u201cFor decades, international arbitration courts like ICSID have allowed corporations to sue states and restrict their freedom to regulate in favor of consumers, workers and the environment.\u201d Since the 2021 election of President Xiomara Castro, Honduras has faced 10 ICSID cases, the largest from the United States-based Pr√≥spera, with its nearly $11 billion claim amounting to a third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Specifically, Castro repealed laws that created Zones of Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs), which aimed to attract overseas investors in a bid to boost the Honduran economy. In June 2021, the United Nations expressed human rights concerns over ZEDE\u2019s legal frameworks and called for an alternative system. It highlighted that around 35% of Honduras \u2014 mostly areas with indigenous and Afro-descendant populations who lacked \u201cinformed consultation\u201d on the scheme \u2014 was earmarked for ZEDE use. Pr√≥spera carved out a ZEDE on the Honduran island of Roat√°n, about 40 miles (65 km) off the country\u2019s northern coast, and the laws at the time effectively gave it sovereignty over the island, including the ability to make its own laws, courts, authorities and taxes.

Pr√≥spera saw pushback from island locals concerned over its growing size and worries about being displaced from their ancestral lands. The UN also claimed that the communities near Pr√≥spera lacked consultation and information on the project, which Pr√≥spera denied. Reuters reported in February that the former head of Honduras\u2019 financial watchdog, Jose Luis Moncada, said the agreement between the country and Pr√≥spera still stands. Moncada said Honduras is \u201cobliged to respect the result\u201d of any arbitration presented before the end of August, when it\u2019s slated to leave ICSID.

The correction was caused by overheated market conditions in what analysts have christened a \u201cpre-halving retrace\u201d ahead of the Bitcoin halving event that is roughly 30 days away. However, a report by CryptoQuant shows that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over, given the relatively low level of investment flows from new investors and price valuation metrics still below levels seen in past market tops. The on-chain data analytic firm\u2019s \u201cWeekly Crypto Report\u201d reveals that 48% of Bitcoin investment is coming from short-term holders. The \u201cbull cycle typically ends with 84%\u201392% of investment\u201d from these new investors, according to CryptoQuant analysts. \u201cThe Bitcoin bull cycle is still far from over, as shown by the relatively low level of new investment flows.\u201d The chart above also reveals that this metric has \u201creached levels similar to mid-2019 (52%) when Bitcoin also experienced a meaningful correction,\u201d something that short-term traders should watch out for. The CryptoQuant report also revealed that valuation metrics are still below levels consistent with past market tops. \u201cCryptoQuant P&L Index is still outside a market top zone (red area) and above the index\u2019s 1-year moving average.\u201d Related: BTC price dip hits 17.5% as week\u2019s Bitcoin ETF net outflows near $500M CryptoQuant\u2019s PnL index is made up of three on-chain indicators that show the profitability of Bitcoin. The index has previously indicated that the crypto market will enter a bull cycle in 2024. However, the chart above shows that the current level is slightly below those observed when the market peaked during the 2013, 2017 and 2021 bull runs. Apart from the metrics discussed above, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is a major driver expected to bolster BTC price, ushering in a parabolic uptrend. According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s halving countdown, Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event is less than 31 days away. With approximately 4,450 blocks to go, the estimated time remaining would see Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving take place on April 20, with the miner block rewards reducing by 50% from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s supply halving has been associated with an uptick in BTC\u2019s price. The halving has always preceded a significant bull run in the Bitcoin market. Standard Chartered Bank has made a bold prediction, raising its forecast for BTC price from $100,000 to $150,000 in 2024. In an investment note to clients on Monday, March 18, Standard Chartered Bank analysts wrote: \u201cFor 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000.\u201d The bank also predicted BTC\u2019s price would reach the cycle top of $250,000 in 2025 before settling at around $200,000. Although the bank\u2019s analysis is not entirely based on the halving event, it draws on the impressive performance of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds since they began trading on Jan. 11 and the different dynamics they bring to the market this halving cycle.

BNB climbed from a low of $500 on March 20 to an intra-day high of $539. At the time of writing, the price was hovering around $550, up 5% over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. BNB\u2019s performance has been bullish over the last month. The layer 1 token has soared 50% over the last 30 days and 61% in March alone to reach $645 on March 16, its highest value since November 2021. This rally brought BNB within 7% reach of its all-time high of $690 reached on May 10, 2021. This has left many traders wondering whether the BNB price will return to its all-time highs. Let\u2019s look at the factors that could potentially bolster BNB higher. Binance crypto exchange appears to be holding on to its market share even after regulatory challenges in the United States and abroad marred its operations. After a wild legal ride in 2022 that ended with the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stepping down and a $4.3 billion fine for the exchange, Binance has recovered its trading volume market share. Data from CCData shows that Binance\u2019s market share continued to rise since October 2023, climbing for the fifth consecutive month to more than 40%. This is corroborated by data from CoinGecko, which shows that the total 24-hour trading volume on all crypto exchanges at $178 billion, with Binance accounting for $41.7 billion of this on March 20. ByBit comes in second place, contributing only $7.5 billion, and OKX is in third place with $6.5 billion. Just as the exchange has overcome the negative branding impact of its regulatory challenges, the exchange\u2019s BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is also \u201cmaking a comeback of its own,\u201d according to K33 Research. David Zimmerman, a DeFi analyst at K33 Research, says BNB\u2019s \u201cprice action has led to more activity on-chain, and there is life once more on BSC.\u201d Independent analyst and X user Kyledoops spotted BNB price trading at $586 before the correction and said that the increasing total value locked on the blockchain is fueled by \u201cBNB\u2019s surge into price discovery mode.\u201d \u201c$BNB TVL skyrockets to $6 billion, hitting levels not seen since June 2022.\u201d Data from DefiLlama shows that BNB Chain\u2019s TVL increased by 54% in 2024, suggesting that users and developers are interacting more with the network. According to data from DappRadar, the BNB Chain remains a powerhouse among layer 1 blockchains, handling 7.07 million transactions in the last 30 days against Ethereum\u2019s 1.2 million transactions. Related: Web3 Gamer: Gods Unchained app drops crypto, Kings of Fighters Arena review Unique Active Wallets (UAW) is a metric DappRadar uses to express how many individual crypto wallet addresses interact with a blockchain\u2019s smart contracts. The figure above shows that the BNB Chain also leads in total unique address wallets where more than 2 million UAWs have interacted with the layer protocol over the last 30 days. This is way higher than 585,430 UAWs on Ethereum and 142,890 on Avalanche. BNB price is currently 21% below its all-time high of $690. The K33 Research report claims that even though Solana (SOL) has stolen the limelight in the recent past, \u201cBNB has had an equally impressive move this year and is significantly closer to record highs.\u201d Zimmerman notes, \u201cBSC was a major area for altcoin madness in the previous bull run, and it looks as though it is warming up for another run here.\u201d In a March 14 post on X, independent analyst Batman spotted BNB very close to all-time highs, saying that the \u201c$BNB price has been on a monster run lately.\u201d Batman added, \u201cPrice discovery is not very far away from BNB. This could lead to a huge rally for altcoins in the BNB ecosystem.\u201d The price was trading 20% below the all-time high at the time of publication. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator was still in the positive region above the zero line, suggesting that the market conditions still favored the upside. The key levels to watch above this are $550 and $600. The bulls have to flip this supply zone back into support before pushing the price toward all-time highs at $690 and ushering BNB into price discovery.

The exploit affected users who previously authorized approvals to the contract, and the development team recommended revoking approvals to the Ethereum Dolomite address that begins with 0xe2466. The development team claimed that users who have only interacted with the current version on Arbitrum should not be affected. They have also disabled the faulty contract, which should protect users who have not yet become victims of the attack. Even so, the team argued that users should revoke approvals to this contract. Dolomite is a decentralized exchange and money market protocol that currently runs on Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM. It originally launched on Ethereum in 2019. The team migrated it to the Arbitrum network in 2022 and gradually phased out support for the Ethereum version. Because of the immutable nature of smart contracts, users can still interact with its Ethereum version using developer tools. According to the CertiK report, the attacker exploited a function named \u201ccallFunction\u201d that allows a user to make any arbitrary calls. This function is guarded by a \u201cnoEntry\u201d modifier, which under normal circumstances, should prevent any reentrancy attacks. However, this guard can be bypassed by the TradeManager contract located at 0xe2466, which contains a \u201ccall\u201d function that has no reentrancy guard. Thus, the attacker was able to use this contract to drain funds from users, CertiK claimed. The attacker transferred all of the stolen funds to address 0x5eAA7DadA44d59549A6c58008b2bd3C7F81d2502 and then deposited them into Tornado cash, Certik stated.

According to data from investment firm Farside, the recent fall has led to roughly $480 million in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the past two days. If the Bitcoin ETF investments fail to pick up, another round of selling cannot be ruled out, but a fall does not mean the bull market is over. Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards said in a X post that it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d for volatility to pick up one month \u201ceither side of the Bitcoin Halving.\u201d However, he added that the 12-month period following the halving historically offers the best risk-reward tradeoff for Bitcoin. While retail traders speculate on the next move in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin, continues to buy more. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a X post that the firm bought 9,245 Bitcoin \u201cusing proceeds from convertible notes & excess cash.\u201d The latest purchase boosted the firm\u2019s stockpile to 214,246 Bitcoin, more than 1% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist. Will Bitcoin and altcoins continue their correction, or is it time for the recovery to begin? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin turned down from the support line of the ascending channel on March 18, indicating that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. That intensified selling and pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($65,271) on March 19. The bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $61,736. A bounce off the current level is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong selling on rallies. The BTC/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($56,614), where the bulls are expected to buy aggressively. The first sign of strength will be a rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may rise to $69,000. This is the final hurdle before the pair challenges the all-time high at $73,777. The failure to maintain Ether (ETH) above the 20-day EMA ($3,550) on March 18 attracted aggressive selling by the traders. That pulled the price to the 50-day SMA ($3,113) on March 20. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. The recovery is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. That could keep the ETH/USDT pair stuck between both moving averages for some time. A break below the 50-day SMA will suggest that the bulls are dumping their positions in a hurry. That could sink the pair to $2,717. Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will signal that the bulls are back in the game. BNB\u2019s (BNB) pullback reached the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $500 on March 19, just below the 20-day EMA ($511). The bulls are trying to stop the fall at the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The BNB/USDT pair could rally to $590, where the bulls and the bears are likely to witness a tough battle. If the price turns down from $590, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. That increases the risk of a slide to the breakout level of $460. On the contrary, if buyers kick the price above $590, it will suggest that the pullback may be over. The pair may then climb to $645. The bulls pushed Solana (SOL) above the $205 resistance on March 18 but could not sustain the breakout. That may have tempted short-term traders to book profits. The SOL/USDT pair dipped to the 20-day EMA ($158) on March 20, a crucial support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will again try to drive the price above the overhead resistance at $205. On the other hand, a shallow bounce will suggest a lack of aggressive buying at the current levels. If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, the selling could accelerate, and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($126). XRP (XRP) has been trading inside a large range between $0.46 and $0.74 for several months. Trading inside a range can be volatile and random. The XRP/USDT pair is trying to take support at the uptrend line, but the relief rally is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, the pair could slump to the support of the range at $0.46. On the contrary, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. The bullish momentum could pick up if the pair rises above $0.67. The pair may subsequently climb to the formidable resistance at $0.74. Cardano (ADA) turned lower from the 20-day EMA ($0.68) on March 18 and plunged below the 50-day SMA ($0.62) on March 19. The ADA/USDT pair is attempting to take support at $0.57, but the recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will increase the possibility of a break below $0.57. The pair may then skid to $0.53. If buyers shove the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair may reach the 20-day EMA. This remains the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. A break above this level will suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The bears sold Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) recovery attempts on March 17 and pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA ($0.15) on March 18. The selling continued on March 19, and the DOGE/USDT pair plunged to the strong support at $0.12 on March 20. Buyers are expected to guard the 50-day SMA ($0.11), but they may find it difficult to propel the price above $0.16. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting that bears have a slight edge. The bulls will be back in command on a break above $0.16. That could clear the path for a rally to $0.19. Related: How low can the Bitcoin price go? The long wick on Avalanche\u2019s (AVAX) March 18 candlestick shows profit booking at higher levels. The selling picked up, and the price reached the breakout level of $50 on March 20. Buyers will try to flip the $50 level into support. If they succeed, the AVAX/USDT pair could again rise toward $65. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may consolidate between $50 and $65 for a while. A break and close below $50 suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the next solid support at the 50-day SMA ($42). The bulls will have to catapult the price above $65 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. Shiba Inu (SHIB) slipped below the $0.000029 support on March 16, and the bears successfully defended the retest on March 17. This suggests that the bears are trying to flip $0.000029 into resistance. The SHIB/USDT pair fell to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000023 on March 20, which is the last bastion of support. If this level cracks, the pair may nosedive to the 50-day SMA ($0.000017). The deeper the fall, the greater the time it will take for the new up-move to begin. The bulls will have to drive and sustain the price above the resistance line to indicate that the correction may be over. The pair could then travel to the overhead resistance of $0.000035 and eventually $0.000039. Toncoin (TON) pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($3.39), but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip, as seen from the strong bounce on March 17. The bears sold the rallies and tried to sink the price below the 20-day EMA on March 18 and 19, but the bulls held their ground. Buyers are trying to sustain the price above $4.15. If they manage to do that, the TON/USDT pair could rise to $4.60. A break and close above this level will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend to $5.64. The crucial support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. The bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA to indicate that a local top may be in place.

The report looks at the experience of end-users and focuses on offline functionality. There were mixed results. The Riksbank released its fourth and last report on the e-krona on March 20. It examined a different model for offline retail transactions from the one it had proposed in Phase 2 of the pilot. In that model, offline transaction information was held on mobile phones. The Riksbank is now considering the use of a \u201cshadow wallet\u201d in the online system and a payment card (stored-value card). Both elements were already foreseen in the system design. The card would act as the payment instrument and track the offline changes to account balances. Four use cases were examined: funding and defunding the payment instrument, offline payment at a point of sale (POS) using near-field communication, offline transfers between two cards and imposing limitations on the balance and number of transactions on a card. Mobile phones were used for communications between cards and between a card and a POS. Because mobile phones were not considered secure components in the chain of transactions: \u201cUser-to-user payments require many steps to be considered secure, which compromises user-friendliness. [\u2026] The opportunity to reduce the number of steps is considered small in this design.\u201d Another problem facing the Riksbank CBDC is synchronizing payment cards. If the order of synchronization after a series of transactions is not right, some shadow wallets could be left illiquid. Counters would ensure offline payments are synchronized in the right order. They would also prevent replay attacks, in which the same e-krona is used by the same party in multiple times. Related: Swedish Riksbank report looks at collaboration with potential e-krona in retail payments Restrictions would be programmed into the card, setting limits on the size and number of offline transactions it could enable. That would mean that new cards would have to be issued when restrictions change. Digital certificates were used to guarantee the security of instructions flowing between payment cards and the intermediary, which is R3\u2019s Corda platform. The certificates were self-signed but trusted and verified infrastructure would be needed before the system launched. Sweden began researching an e-krona in 2020. The Riksbank promised to continue CBDC research, in case legislation is passed to introduce one.

The benefits offered by blockchain technology continue to pique the interest of the non-crypto domain. Known for its immutability, transparency and traceability, blockchain has a profound impact on the enterprise world, with 9 out of 10 businesses using or planning to use it. While organizations recognize that blockchain represents a significant step forward, one challenge persists: the industry still struggles with achieving interoperability between blockchain networks. On the bright side, various projects are actively working to overcome these challenges, with one in particular enabling seamless asset transfers across different blockchain networks. Coreum, a layer-1 blockchain designed for scalability, security and interoperability, aims to overcome integration challenges between ecosystems, especially XRP Ledger (XRPL). Known for its decentralized, open-source structure, XRPL excels in providing fast, energy-efficient transactions and houses its native coin, XRP. With the Bridge connecting Coreum and XRPL, developers have the opportunity to create interoperable decentralized applications (DApps). The development of new DApps has the potential to increase liquidity and improve the utility and accessibility of XRPL. Furthermore, the two-way bridge facilitates real-world asset\u2019s (RWA) making their way from the XRPL to the Cosmos blockchain network, giving projects the ability to take advantage of the smart token tech, ISO 20022 messaging and decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities within Coreum. Bridging to Coreum opens up entirely new DeFi opportunities for XRPL assets, such as staking for rewards, earning interest through yielding and engaging in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. Coreum expands XRPL\u2019s DeFi capabilities into a wider range of blockchain financial services, enhancing user engagement. By ensuring seamless asset transfers between blockchains, XRP holders can access the expansive world of DeFi. Users can benefit from DeFi opportunities, including staking, lending and borrowing using Coreum. As an enterprise-grade blockchain platform, Coreum aims to redefine the capabilities and efficiency of enterprise-level blockchain applications by adopting the ISO 20022 standard on-chain. ISO 20022 standardization enables seamless communication and integration between different platforms, streamlining the transaction process and enabling a wider range of financial services to operate on blockchain. Coreum has developed the XRPL Coreum Bridge, which provides uninterrupted asset transfers and inter-chain communication. The bridge creates a direct conduit for the transfer of assets between the XRPL and a wide array of IBC-compatible blockchains. The IBC protocol is a framework designed to enable reliable communication and asset transfer between independent blockchain networks. The XRPL Coreum Bridge's decentralized and noncustodial operation distinguishes it from other blockchain bridges. By design, no central authority or intermediary is responsible for holding or managing assets, ensuring users have full control over their assets at all times. This approach minimizes trust issues and reduces the risk of theft or loss caused by hacking central structures.  On the XRPL Coreum Bridge, assets flow through a decentralized and noncustodial mechanism. Source: Coreum The bridge's architecture consists of three main parts. The first part, the multisignature account, works like a safe deposit box that can be opened with multiple keys. This account interacts with the Relayer Set, and uses a multi-signing function to processs data and ensure security. In the second step, Relayers between the multisignature account on XRPL and the Bridge smart contract on the Coreum blockchain come into play. Relayers, which are responsible for listening to events on both chains and triggering actions on XRPL and Coreum, are incentivized with transaction fees. Finally, the bridge contract maintains the operational state and execution. The smart contract is also responsible for minting new tokens on Coreum. The XRPL Coreum Bridge has achieved the milestone by seamlessly connecting XRPL to the Coreum and Cosmos ecosystems. The Coreum team plans to expand the bridge's functionality and integrate with additional blockchains to support a more connected crypto ecosystem. Increasing interoperability offers the opportunity to expand the reach of blockchain technology beyond traditional boundaries and unlock new potential outside of digital finance. This vision promises a more connected, efficient and innovative blockchain ecosystem where the free flow of assets and seamless integration of services becomes the new norm.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Adoption, #XRP, #Enterprise, #DeFi"},{"date":"Mar 20, 2024","summary":"","author":"Turner Wright","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/sec-ether-security-classification","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"SEC is attempting to classify Ether as a security: Report","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly issued several subpoenas to companies related to attempts to label Ether as a security.

According to a March 20 Bloomberg report, a Celsius bankruptcy oversight committee has begun contacting customers who withdrew more than $100,000 prior to its collapse, with the goal of using potential returned funds to pay back customers who did not withdraw from the platform in time. As stated by trustees, the clawback is expected to affect 2% of Celsius customers who collectively withdrew 40% of the firm\u2019s assets at the eleventh hour before its bankruptcy filing. The committee will offer clawback-affected customers a \u201cfavorable rate\u201d if they decide to settle, with the threat of litigation if funds are not returned. In addition, customers who settle will have their notional digital assets adjusted based on their July 2022 value, near the nadir of the crypto bear market, allowing them to keep whatever capital appreciation resultant from the market recovery. On Jan. 31, Celsius exited bankruptcy and began the redistribution of more than $3 billion in crypto and fiat money to users, which was agreed upon by 98% of creditors. However, some business creditors have since alleged that their fiat money payouts would reduce their claims by 30% compared to being paid in crypto. The firm also settled $4.7 billion in fines with the United States Federal Trade Commission alongside settlements with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Its CEO, Alex Mashinsky, resigned in September 2022. In July 2023, he was indicted on seven felony counts, including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud related to his activities at the platform. He is free on a $40 million bail at the time of publication.

In the \u201cAhead of the Curve\u201d report published on March 19, K33 head of research Anders Helseth and senior analyst Vetle Lunde said Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cslow bleed\u201d and the steadily declining prices across the crypto market accompanied by high funding rates have exposed cryptocurrencies to \u201c leverage-induced amplified downside volatility.\u201d The analysts explained that Bitcoin has lost over 13% of its value over the past week after hitting an all-time high of $73,835 on March 14. Ether (ETH) and BNB Chain\u2019s BNB (BNB) have also lost 17% and 1% of their value, respectively, per the report. \u201cBitcoin is currently trading in a 14% drawdown from its all-time high. In all prior bull markets, Bitcoin has seen drawdowns as deep as 30% before recovering.\u201d However, futures open interest is \u201cholding firm while perps maintain significant premiums.\u201d Helseth and Lunde added that the overheated conditions were supported by the shallow or negative inflows into Bitcoin investment products last week. The chart below shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have seen declining inflows, with March 18 \u201cseeing a new yearly high daily net outflow of 4,453 BTC.\u201d The negative flows stem from outflows from Grayscale\u2019s converted Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), which saw $642 million exit the ETF on March 18, according to data from Farside Investors. The other nine new ETFs saw shallow inflows, with net outflows resting at $154 million on March 18. The K33 research analysts, however, cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to determine whether the spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached a saturation point and whether the recent activity represents a regime change. \u201cWhile the three-day flow is negative, the weekly net flow to Bitcoin ETFs still sits at a solid 27,000 BTC due to back-to-back massive flow days until Wednesday last week.\u201d Nonetheless, shallowing ETF flows have been a key contributor to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cadverse price\u201d action.

Analysts compare BTC price targets vs previous halvings","type":"Blog","category":"Bitcoin Halving","content":"Institutional investors\u2019 strong demand for buying the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Bitcoin\u2019s history of strong outperformance around the supply-halving event are thought to be the main reasons for the cryptocurrency hitting new all-time highs in 2024. The Bitcoin (BTC) halving has previously been associated with bull markets, with the price displaying a parabolic uptrend and a price peak in the months following the event. Halvings happen every four years and reduce miner block rewards by 50%. The next halving is roughly 30 days away and will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Historically, BTC price bull runs have been linked to halving events. Expectations of decreased supply and rising demand have previously resulted in exponential price growth and positive market sentiment. There have been three Bitcoin halvings in the past, and one consistent thing the market has witnessed from these previous events is that one month before each halving, the BTC price was lower than it was at the time of the halving (see table below). The table above shows that the price of Bitcoin was around $12 at the time of the first halving on Nov. 28, 2012. One year later, in November 2013, Bitcoin had risen to a peak high at $1,242, more than 10,000% higher than the price at halving. The second halving occurred on July 9, 2016, and Bitcoin\u2019s price rose to a previous all-time high of about $19,785 by December 2017. At the time of the third halving on May 11, 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $8,730, rising to its all-time high of nearly $69,000 by November 2021. BTC price tends to rise with the reduced supply entering the open market as long as demand remains constant or increases. This is because the reduction in the supply issuance rate emphasizes Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, which can drive up demand and consequently increase its price. Moreover, the halving event draws attention to the crypto industry, attracting new investors and driving increased trader activity. Popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital analyzed the \u201c5 Phases of The Bitcoin Halving,\u201d drawing on historical price action to explain what he expects to happen in the days before and after the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. The phases include the prehalving period, prehalving rally, prehalving retrace, reaccumulation and the \u201cparabolic uptrend\u201d as the final phase, where BTC price grows exponentially, reaching new all-time highs. It is worth noting that historical price action may not be repeated in the future, but the anticipation of a bull market may push investors to increase capital flows into the asset. BTC price could be on track for the coveted $100,000 mark, particularly after surpassing its 2021 all-time high before the halving. While some are setting even higher price targets, other analysts believe the halving has already been priced in. Related: Is Tesla buying Bitcoin again? BTC wallet data sparks curiosity Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex expect that the incredible demand fueled by the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs will help propel BTC to its current peak above $69,000. In a market research report shared with Cointelegraph, the analysts said: \u201cOur analysis forecasts a conservative price objective of $100,000-$120,000 to be achieved by Q4 2024, and the cycle peak to be achieved sometime in 2025 in terms of total crypto market capitalization.\u201d While Bitcoin price typically breaks its previous highs several months after the four-year cycle halving events, its price action appears to be playing out differently this year. BTC breached its previous all-time high on March 5 to set a series of new record highs to peak at $73,835 on March 15. Peter Brandt shared his insights on when Bitcoin might scale new historic levels based on this performance in a March 6 post on X. Brant projected that the price of the big crypto might reach $150,000 by Q4 2025. Related: Bitcoin maxis are about to kick off the altseason as BTC turns institutional Brandt said: \u201cIf the pace of the bull trend after April 2024 is at a similar pace to the bull trend since the November 2022 low, then the high in October 2025 could be around $150,000. However, the post-halving advances during previous bull cycles have been much steeper than the pre-halving advances.\u201d According to pseudonymous quantitative analyst PlanB, the bull market began on March 1 after the end of an accumulation period. Plan B shared the following chart on X, saying: \u201cBull market has started. If history is any guide, we will see ~10 months of face-melting FOMO: extreme price pumps combined with multiple -30% drops.!\u201d Bullish sentiments on BTC\u2019s price were also shared by Deribit and GenesisVol, who suggest a potential rise of as much as 20.8% in Bitcoin\u2019s price before halving to areas between $70,000 and $80,000. Aside from insights from market analysts, Bitcoin mining experts also share a positive outlook for Bitcoin prices after the halving. Andy Fajar Handika, co-founder and CEO of decentralized Bitcoin mining pool Loka Mining, anticipates short-term volatility consistent with previous halvings due to supply shock and reduced inflation rate. In comments to Cointelegraph, Fajar said: \u201cThis year will see an amplification of scarcity narratives attributed to the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and the success of meta-protocols such as Ordinals.\u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The mandate was given on Tuesday, March 19, 2024. According to the official statement, the revised fee framework is an amendment to a directive initiated by the Ministry of Justice in September 2022. This change follows the NAPP\u2019s assessment of the \u201cadequate profitability\u201d within the cryptocurrency retail and exchange sectors, prompting the introduction of a new fee structure impacting both entities. Under the updated fee system, crypto exchanges face a monthly fee of 740 basis reference value (BRV), equivalent to 251.6 million Uzbekistani som ($20,015) \u2014the country\u2019s fiat currency \u2014 marking a substantial increase from the previous fee of 400 BRV or 136 million som ($10,819). The BRV is primarily used to calculate various financial transactions, including taxes, fees and fines. In contrast, crypto retailers now face a notably elevated fee of 185 BRV per month, or 62.9 million som ($5,003). Previously, the fees for crypto retailers stood at just 20 BRV, which is around 6.8 million som ($540). According to the NAPP, the modifications aim to boost state revenue from the crypto sector. The agency anticipates the revenue generated from this sector to double once the new structure is in place. The NAPP also guaranteed that the updated pricing structure would not harm the financial stability of industry service providers. The new structure is scheduled to take effect on June 20, three months after its official publication. Related: Bitcoin mining restricted to legal entities in Uzbekistan \u2014 Regulators The recent mandate follows closely after the NAPP signed a Memorandum of Understanding with stablecoin issuer Tether.

As of now, the partnership\u2019s specific details are undisclosed. However, Tether has disclosed plans to collaborate with Uzbekistan\u2019s regulators to establish a legal and regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country.

Only licensed exchanges are permitted in Uzbekistan, with trading servers mandated to be domestically hosted. The government of Uzbekistan has restricted the provision of crypto services to licensed cryptocurrency firms since 2023. The first licenses were granted to local crypto firms in November 2022. Before that, Uzbekistan restricted access to a number of large international crypto exchanges, including Binance, FTX and Huobi, due to accusations of unlicensed activity. Magazine: Big Questions.

As of March 20, it has reached a two-week low of $60,760. Bitcoin\u2019s price drop coincides with anticipations that the Federal Reserve will maintain its key interest rates within the existing 525-550 basis points (bps) range. Furthermore, the continued withdrawals from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are exacerbating the downward pressure on its price. Let's discuss how low can the Bitcoin price go in the ongoing correction cycle. The current correction within Bitcoin's bull market may see it potentially dip below the $60,000 threshold by the end of March. Notably, BTC could decline toward its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave in the chart below) at approximately $58,780. This EMA wave support was instrumental in limiting BTC's bull market correction in January 2024. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) also aligns with Bitcoin\u2019s horizontal support level of around $59,310. This level, after being tested on March 5, preceded a 24.5% surge in price. Bitcoin price risks continuing its bull market correction toward $40,000, according to market analyst Rekt Capital. Rekt Capital\u2019s pessimistic forecast centers on Bitcoin\u2019s pre-halving price trends. The analyst highlighted the current price correction and compared it to the patterns observed before the last two halvings. From a fractal analysis perspective, Bitcoin is now in a \u201cDanger Zone,\u201d eyeing an extended correction toward its ascending trendline support near $40,000. Four years ago, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a roughly 50% retracement in the months leading up to the 2020 halving, a downturn significantly intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic in March. Nonetheless, it stabilized around $10,000 for the remainder of the halving year, setting the stage for a bull market revival in 2021. Similarly, Bitcoin underwent a 33% pullback around the 2016 halving but recovered by year's end, eventually propelling into a bull market in 2017 that culminated in a peak of $20,000. Going by the fractal analysis, Bitcoin's ongoing price correction could eventually be exhausted, followed by a bullish reversal to a new record high, as shown below. Fibonacci retracement levels, meanwhile, show Bitcoin will likely consolidate within the $50,000-60,000 range in the coming days or weeks. Notably, the Bitcoin weekly chart reveals an intriguing price performance around the Fibonacci retracement levels during bullish reversal periods. The 0.618 level, also known as the \u201cGolden Ratio,\u201d is particularly noteworthy. Historically, Bitcoin's price has frequently tested the 0.618 level as support after approaching or establishing a record high. This is highlighted in the red-shaded area of the chart above, reaffirming that Bitcoin's next support level could be around $50,000.

One thing remains constant through all the possibilities and probabilities, stacking block after block, following the plan silently in the background: Bitcoin.

The oldest law in economics is supply and demand. To increase the price of something, decrease supply and increase demand. To decrease the price of something, increase supply and decrease demand. If we study Bitcoin\u2019s tokenomics, it has a deflationary issuance schedule marked by the halving of new supply every four years. While the halving continues technically like Zeno\u2019s paradox (halving forever and never actually reaching zero), it becomes infinitesimal around the year 2140. On the supply side of the economic scale, Satoshi Nakamoto took care of the \u201cless supply\u201d portion of the law of supply and demand. Nothing was guaranteed on the demand side, however. Satoshi was acutely aware of this, having talked about these issues on the Cryptography Mailing List and in the recently released emails with Marti Miami. Satoshi was well aware of economics, including the Austrian School of economic theories of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. Satoshi and the early Bitcoiners let the free market decide the fate of the demand portion of the equation. Recent: How much does it cost to build a crypto mining rig at home? Since the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, the fiat currency price of Bitcoin has continuously seen price discovery and retracement. One of the macroeconomic factors that has helped speculative assets like Bitcoin since the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 has been low interest rates across much of the developed world. This access to cheap money encourages more speculation on riskier assets, such as in the emerging technology sector. However, in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising interest rates from 0.25% to 5.5% as of the first quarter of 2024. Bitcoin\u2019s price action during this time saw positive and negative shocks on the news of rate hikes. In July 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price shot up when the Fed announced a 75 basis points rate hike; it had some instant upside volatility in November 2022 upon another 75-point rate hike and continued to climb steadily in 2023 as the Federal Reserve hiked rates to 22-year highs. While it cannot be dismissed that Bitcoin may be susceptible to interest rate changes by the Fed, the trend shows BTC\u2019s declining value in fiat terms during periods of sustained rate hikes by the Fed. However, interest rates are higher now than at any point in Bitcoin\u2019s existence, and Bitcoin\u2019s price hovers around $63,000 at the time of writing, meaning other factors are trumping the impact of interest rates on BTC\u2019s price. One of the factors resulting from the halving event is the idea that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and a store of value. These narratives are fueled by the deflationary aspect of regular Bitcoin halvings and promoted by investment experts like Greg Foss, executive director of strategic initiatives at Validus Power Corp. The Bitcoin halving does not necessarily answer the question of demand. The fiat value of Bitcoin should rise if the demand for Bitcoin stays the same and the supply decreases. So, what would happen if major institutions started buying Bitcoin? Enter the ETFs. While there has always been what is considered retail trading of BTC, recent years have seen increased interest in Bitcoin from traditional financial institutions. Dan Held, general partner at Asymmetric Financial, wrote of a \u201cBitcoin Supercycle\u201d that would occur once traditional institutions started buying and adopting Bitcoin. The idea was that volatility in the market would not happen in line with other four-year cycles, and the cost would continuously rise due to the increased demand. Not everyone feels this way despite the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs from major traditional and crypto native institutional investors driving up demand for BTC since their launch in January 2024. By some estimates, global crypto adoption just passed over half a billion users, and others predict it could reach the one billion mark by the end of 2024, with the adoption of crypto by the masses \u2014 not institutions \u2014 being the primary force driving utility and stability. In economics, there is a lot of talk about equilibrium. Equilibrium refers to a moment when there are just the right circumstances for an individual to trade one thing for another in a balance between supply and demand. In reality, this equilibrium is in constant motion, as anyone who has followed the price action of Bitcoin can attest to. Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle provides a predictable slashing of new supply, making Bitcoin a deflationary asset. The narrative for demand is the variable in the equation \u2014 be it the cypherpunk ethos of peer-to-peer electronic cash, Bitcoin as a store of value or Bitcoin as simple \u201cnumber go up\u201d technology. As long as demand stays the same, Bitcoin\u2019s fiat value equilibrium will likely see pressure to climb as the cycles move forward. Recent: Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail? On March 13, Bitcoin entered uncharted territory and broke all previous cycles by hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,900 before the halving event in April, leaving analysts scratching their heads about what this means for the future price of BTC as the halving draws closer. However, factoring in inflation since Bitcoin\u2019s previous ATH in November 2021, the ATH is actually around $79,000 today, as measured in fiat terms, and does not factor in the overall purchasing power of the asset. Speculation surrounds the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and whether this will bring stability to the asset in terms of its purchasing power. As powerful and prominent as the institutions are, without usage and utility by the masses, price discovery will likely continue through this cycle as it has in the past, but that is the demand side.

Even so, industry figures are largely bullish and tell Cointelegraph the retracement is not yet a cause for concern. Bitcoin has enjoyed significant price growth in 2024. On Jan. 1, the price of Bitcoin was $42,208. On March 14, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,737. That high is something BTC has not been able to sustain on the 30-day countdown clock. Samson Mow, who has been predicting serious upward price momentum for some time, is confident Bitcoin will soon go on to surpass its all-time high. The CEO of Jan3 \u2014 a technology company focused on expanding Bitcoin access worldwide \u2014 told Cointelegraph he predicts the price will still soar before the halving. Bitcoin is \u201clikely to reach $100,000 before the halving,\u201d said Mow. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough coins to meet the voracious demand from the [exchange-traded funds] ETFs, which devour around 7,000 coins a day.\u201d Mow may predict a significant price rise over the next 30 days, but others say the dip may go deeper. One scenario does not preclude the other. However, it is possible that both a greater dip and a greater high could occur. On X, Ran Neuner told his followers a 20\u201330% dip \u201cwould be completely normal and healthy\u201d during a bull market. A 20%/30% dip would be completely normal and healthy in a bull market,specially a month before the halving. We could go as low as $55k/$60k easily and that would be a crazy buying opportunity. I\u2019m not rushing to buy anything yet\u2026 \u2014 Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) March 15, 2024 Similarly, Danny Chong, co-founder of decentralized asset tracker Tranchess, told Cointelegraph the direction of travel could be downward. \u201cAfter the Bitcoin halving, instead of a continued upward trajectory, we may experience a temporary downturn. However, the overall market sentiment can be expected to remain bullish,\u201d he said, \u201cThis optimism is linked to the broader dynamics with ETF-related development. The interest and growth in ETFs have become a significant factor in maintaining a positive market outlook.\u201d Recent: How much does it cost to build a crypto mining rig at home? Chong further stated that a pre-halving price dip was simply a matter of historical precedent. \u201cIn each of these cycles, the halving effect on the Bitcoin price was similar and displayed a pattern: a substantial rally leading up to the halving, followed by a brief correction and period of consolidation before the major bull run and blow-off top. The peak occurred approximately 18 months after the halving each time.\u201d Chong said that this \u201chighly simplified\u201d analysis still held true. Even if a dip continues, the longer-term direction of travel for the original cryptocurrency is likely to be up, industry observers say. Danny Lim, core contributor at decentralized exchange MarginX, told Cointelegraph, \u201cThis upcoming event is set apart by the involvement of institutional investors driving even higher demand against this constrained supply, likely to provide strong support for Bitcoin\u2019s price during potential retracements.\u201d Zac Cheah, co-founder and CEO of Pundi X, a blockchain-based point-of-sale solution, also believes this halving is unique due to market conditions. Just 30 days before the event, Cheah told Cointelegraph that the 2024 halving was different because \u201cBitcoin\u2019s floor price enjoys robust support due to the heightened demand from institutional investors.\u201d \u201cThe competition between giants like MicroStrategy and BlackRock, vying for the title of top Bitcoin holders, not only fuels bullish sentiments but also amplifies transaction activity, leading to greater profits for Bitcoin miners.\u201d With the United States Federal Reserve considering interest rate cuts, the positive case for Bitcoin only gets stronger. \u201cHistorically, Bitcoin has thrived in lower interest rate environments. Considering these positive factors, there is substantial anticipation around Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the upcoming halving cycle, with forecasts indicating a potential surge to as high as $100,000,\u201d Cheah said. Cheah\u2019s $100,000 prediction matches similar comments from Mow. Whether it can achieve those lofty heights with the halving a mere month away, all eyes are on Bitcoin. With the rest of the market seemingly dragged up or down by Bitcoin\u2019s considerable gravity well, Cointelegraph asked Mow whether crypto would ride Bitcoin\u2019s coattails all the way to the top or whether BTC would decouple from the rest of the market. Recent: UK court rules Craig Wright not Nakamoto, ending long-standing drama \u201cBitcoin will decouple from \u2018crypto\u2019 simply because we have massive tailwinds from the ETFs. We now have $500 million to $1 billion in inflows every trading day. \u2018Crypto\u2019 simply does not have that vast pool of capital flowing in. So while \u2018crypto\u2019 coins can track Bitcoin for a time because they\u2019re small and have low liquidity, it\u2019s inevitable they lose steam and are left behind,\u201d said Mow. \u201cOr the founders/insiders simply decide to stop propping up the prices and buy Bitcoin \u2014 which is all too common, and retail buyers are left holding the bag,\u201d he said.

In the last month alone, Google poured 25 million euros into a new initiative to boost AI competency skills for Europeans and partnered with the French government to set up a new AI-dedicated hub in Paris. At the same time, its rival Microsoft announced a 3 billion euro investment into AI development in Germany. On March 20, sources told the Financial Times that Germany\u2019s Aleph Alpha and two United Kingdom-based AI firms \u2014 Synthesia and StabilityAI \u2014 are considering relocating their headquarters abroad. According to the report, officials from Canada and the United Arab Emirates have approached the companies, attempting to lure them from the European Union region. The sources said they were offered subsidies, relaxed tax regimes and \u201clight-touch\u201d regulation. This comes as the European Union passed its landmark AI Act on March 13, which set into motion the world\u2019s first comprehensive set of AI regulations for the development and deployment of AI tools within the EU. Jonas Andrulis, founder and chief executive of Aleph Alpha, told the FT that they have already been approached by companies outside the region, saying: \u201cOh, now, with all that horrible regulation, don\u2019t you want to move your AI R&D company?\u201d However, in a comment to Cointelegraph a representative from Aleph Alpha said, \"[the company] has no intention of relocating abroad, and that we are fully committed to our headquarters in Heidelberg.

In the Middle East, OpenAI, the developer of the popular chatbot ChatGPT, has been in talks with investors from the United Arab Emirates for the development of its own semiconductor chip, which followed a separate agreement with two companies in the country as a part of its Middle East expansion. Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, the government is reportedly considering creating a $40 billion investment fund in the AI sector overseen by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which would make the country the largest investor in the AI space.

At the turn of the new year, many people make New Year\u2019s resolutions to improve themselves in some way, and one of the most common resolutions is to exercise more. According to the Pew Research Center, 79% of Americans who made resolutions for 2024 included at least one focused on their health, exercise or diet. However, studies have shown that the vast majority of people who make resolutions do not ultimately stick to them. One 2016 study found that only 9% of Americans who made resolutions actually kept them. In fact, the second Friday of January is known colloquially as \u201cQuitter\u2019s Day,\u201d which is when people are reportedly most prone to give up on their goals for the new year. What can be done to help encourage movement and exercise throughout the year? According to Oleg Fomenko, co-founder of Sweatcoin and Sweat Economy, the answer is to provide an immediate economic incentive in the form of crypto rewards. Sweatcoin is a move-to-earn app that tracks users\u2019 steps and rewards them with points that can be redeemed for experiences and products, while Sweat Economy is the crypto ecosystem being built atop it, centered around the SWEAT token. On episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, host Jonathan DeYoung spoke with Fomenko about the value of movement, how to quantify what a step is worth, and what a future economy might look like where tokenized exercise is a trillion-dollar industry. Fomenko told DeYoung that human movement and physical activity are incredibly valuable for societies, yet they remain highly undervalued financially. For starters, more active people generally require less medical attention in the long term. When people are healthier, the whole country benefits financially, Fomenko argued: \u201cHealthcare providers, insurers, employers, ultimately governments are benefiting tremendously from you being physically active. You\u2019re going to live longer, and in the most cynical, even rational, you will pay more taxes because you will be economically active for longer.\u201d However, no one has put a concrete monetary value on what movement is worth. Fomenko compared physical activity to attention in this regard. \u201cWe now know how much your attention is worth, very, very precisely,\u201d he said, pointing to Google, Facebook and Amazon. \u201cTwenty years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have an answer. Now we do.\u201d \u201cPhysical activity is, in the same fashion, very, very valuable to you because, as I said, it makes you more productive. It makes you live longer. It makes you fitter, healthier, mentally fit. There are third parties willing to pay for it.\u201d Sweat Economy breaks down one \u201cunit\u201d of movement into one step, and it has begun issuing grants for researchers to determine the monetary value of 10,000 steps. Fomenko said the project is partnering with the University of Cadiz on this effort and will announce more universities soon. Fomeko expects that once the monetary value of physical activity is recognized, tokenized movement will become a major economic force and grow exponentially. Sweatcoin currently pays out SWEAT tokens for the first 5,000 steps to users who opt-in to its crypto features, which is just the first step (pun intended) for Fomenko. Using the attention analogy, he argued that \u201cif humanity has managed to build an economy of $7 trillion around the value of our collective attention, why would the movement economy, or the economy that we will together build around the value of your physical activity, be any smaller than that?\u201d Fomenko hopes that in the future, everyone will be incentivized financially to move more: \u201cThe trade-off that we have in our minds right now is, oh, I need to be healthier? Then it means I need to spend money. We need to flip it in a completely different direction. If I\u2019m healthier, I am earning because it is not just a benefit to me; it is a benefit to absolutely everybody.\u201d One day, movement and physical activity could even be traded on major markets, according to the co-founder. When asked about his ideal future for Sweat Economy, Fomenko responded: \u201cWhat I would love to see is a headline saying physical activity value pumped 20% on the release of the latest obesity report in the U.S. That would be an incredible achievement because that would mean that SWEAT will stop being a token. It will start being perceived as the value of physical activity.\u201d To hear more from Fomenko\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including his thoughts on the health impacts of the metaverse, how the Sweatcoin app prevents fraud, the value of health data and more \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The layer-2 rollup released an updated roadmap on March 20 following the successful implementation of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork. The upgrade to the network introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), chief among them being EIP-4844. EIP-4844 introduced a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing blob space as a replacement for using call data for storage. Using call data to store cryptographic proofs of off-chain bundled transactions has been historically expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely. Related: Ethereum ecosystem needs a major mindset shift for global impact, says Vitalik Buterin Starknet and other significant Ethereum rollups looked to expedite their ability to direct proofs to the blob space following Dencun\u2019s implementation. The network was one of the first to enable the blob function on the same day as the hard fork and reports of a major drop in users\u2019 fees followed hours later. Starknet\u2019s EIP-4844 compatibility resulted in transactions on the protocol averaging $0.017 in fees per transaction. The team had previously expanded the block size of its rollup protocol and reduced fees by an estimated 25% with the release of Starknet v0.13.0 in early 2024. Related: Who is going to build the infrastructure to unite Ethereum rollups? Starknet\u2019s next version update, earmarked for the second quarter of 2024, is set to include transaction parallelization, which will enable the network to execute concurrent independent transactions. The update will allow Starknet to process more transactions simultaneously, which is expected to result in improved throughput and faster finality on its network. Starknet is also planning to further reduce fees on its network with version 0.14.0 expected to ship at the end of 2024, depending on the long-term impact of EIP-4844 and performance improvements of its own protocol. The end-of-year update is set to include three data availability-focused upgrades within its stack. Volition is touted to facilitate hybrid data availability on Starknet, allowing decentralized applications to store data on Starknet instead of Ethereum\u2019s base layer. Application recursion is expected to allow developers to batch proofs of data storage from multiple Starknet blocks onto Ethereum. This upgrade is touted to reduce L1 costs and feed reductions for end-users. Data availability compression is also being developed, which will reduce Starknet\u2019s data footprint on Ethereum. Starknet is exploring two different recursion methods to enable this functionality.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the Hashdex and ARK 21Shares spot Ether ETFs on March 19.

True retail investors won\u2019t touch DeFi unless there\u2019s a better user experience, so more simple infrastructure is necessary.\u201d According to Greenfield, enabling retail access to smart investment strategies is important because individual investors have had less access to wealth management tools than institutions.

The latest appeals court verdict overruled a lower court judgment that absolved YouTube of any responsibility. A San Jose appeals court ruled that YouTube cannot rely on a contentious communications statute to absolve it of liability for a fraud that exploited the Apple co-founder\u2019s popularity using a doctored video to scam people, reported Bloomberg. The latest verdict allows Wozniak to continue the lawsuit against the video streaming platform and potentially paves the way for a change in the federal law protecting video streaming platforms such as YouTube from any liability that comes along with the videos posted on the platform. The Apple co-founder and 17 others, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Michael Dell, filed a lawsuit against YouTube and its parent company, Google, in 2020 after doctored videos promoting a fake scam went viral on YouTube. The doctored video added additional text and pictures promising free Bitcoin (BTC), and viewers were asked to send Bitcoin to a particular address to get double the money. The latest appeals court verdict is seen as a significant win for Wozniak and others since a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge ruled in 2022 that the companies were protected from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Thus, the appeal court observed that companies may not be protected by Section 230 immunity as it contributed to the scam by verifying. Woznaik\u2019s lawyer, Joe Cotchett, said the verdict highlights how social media platforms like \u201cGoogle and YouTube take responsibility for their actions and cannot use Section 230 as a total shield for their conduct.\u201d Magazine: Ether ETFs face Senate opposition, Wright is not Satoshi, and Dencun goes live: Hodler\u2019s Digest: March 10\u201316","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Blockchain, #Bitcoin Regulation, #United States, #Steve Wozniak, #YouTube, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 20, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/who-build-infrastructure-unite-ethereum-rollup","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Who is going to build the infrastructure to unite Ethereum rollups?","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Ethereum has taken a meaningful step in helping layer-2 rollups scale, but the ecosystem needs unifying infrastructure from neutral third-party players to streamline the user experience. That\u2019s the opinion of Avail co-founder Anurag Arjun, who delved into the current state of the rollup ecosystem in an interview with Cointelegraph during the ETHGlobal conference in London. Arjun, who co-founded Ethereum layer-2 Polygon alongside Sandeep Nailwal, Jaynti Kanani and Mihailo Bjelic, has shifted his focus to building agnostic rollup infrastructure to unify the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem. Related: Ethereum ecosystem needs a major mindset shift for global impact, says Vitalik Buterin During his time at Polygon, the team pivoted toward building technology aligned with Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap following the release of Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake chain. This shift also required new infrastructure. Arjun explains: \u201cWe knew in a world of rollups that you also need scalable data availability. So we started Avail within Polygon back in 2020.\u201d In March 2023, Arjun secured the intellectual property rights from Polygon to continue building Avail, allowing him to spin out a standalone company alongside Prabal Banerjee. Arjun told Cointelegraph that they aimed to become a rollup agnostic platform that serves major rollup protocols like StarkWare, zkSync, Arbitrum and Optimism. \u201cThe technology that we\u2019ve implemented is called data sampling. It\u2019s very similar to what Ethereum wants to do on its sharding roadmap,\u201d Arjun explains. The roadmap itself is a long one, with complete danksharding functionality that is only expected to become a reality in the next few years. Arjun says that rollups might not be able to wait long for data sampling capabilities that enable the efficient verification of rollups. \u201cWe realized during the journey that we would solve rollups scalability via scalable data availability. That would end up enabling a world with tens and thousands of rollups, but a very bad user experience,\u201d Arjun said. It\u2019s not an inaccurate reflection of the current Ethereum user experience, where one has to switch between different rollups to bridge funds or carry out transfers or swaps. This fragmented experience for users and the fragmented nature of rollups is something Arjun would like to solve: \u201cTheoretically, we take proofs generated by the independent rollups and aggregate them into one so that you can allow rollups users on rollups to talk to each other.\u201d The envisioned end result is \u201ca unified rollup ecosystem.\u201d Achieving this goal requires a credible, neutral third party coordinating this process between different rollups doing different things. Arjun compares the Solana blockchain, which he describes as one \u201cbig chain with a lot of apps,\u201d while its users only have to contend with one chain. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap has resulted in an ecosystem with many different L2 chains. \u201cIf you look at like apps on the internet, they are not on one giant supercomputer. They\u2019re on different cloud services and talk to each other when required. We anticipate the same happening with rollups in general, and we want to enable that cohesion,\u201d Arjun added. Avail Nexus aims to facilitate this specific integration standard between rollups, similar to Polygon\u2019s recently launched Aggregation layer, which aggregates proofs created by rollups built on the L2\u2019s chain development kit. Related: Ethereum Name Service founder reveals Vitalik Buterin\u2019s timely grant intervention Avail\u2019s technology can take aggregated proofs from Polygon\u2019s AggLayer, Starknet, Optimism, Arbitrum or Scroll and create a \u201ccoordinated rollup\u201d. Arjun describes the technology as an ecosystem-wide effort rather than catering to one ecosystem. It\u2019s a future problem that the ecosystem is already pondering. Arjun said that in a recent presentation from Ethereum, co-founder Vitalik Buterin posed the following question: Who is going to build the infrastructure to unite rollups? \u201cEither it has to be the Ethereum Foundation or some third party who is not in the rollup business,\u201d Arjun concludes. Buterin also attended ETHGlobal in London and hammered home the importance of a mindset shift toward building L2 decentralized applications and solutions in line with Ethereum\u2019s focus on rollup-enabled functionality.

The Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Starknet extended its eligibility of the first round of Starknet provisions to two sub-categories of users that previously had trouble claiming STRK tokens. The Starknet Foundation \u2014 the organization supporting the Starknet network \u2014 straightended out concerns around the eligibility of some pre-Merge ETH stakers and Immutable X users for February\u2019s Starknet (STRK) airdrop after a thorough review of the situation. The company extended its eligibility of first round of Starknet provisions to eligible VeVe users, Non-VeVe StarkEx users who were previously identified as VeVe users and pooled stakers/ The fresh batch of users eligible for the February airdrop can begin claiming their STRK in April, according to a note shared with Cointelegraph. Starknet said a list provided by Immutable showed self-custody IMX addresses and wallets associated with users of the nonfungible token (NFT) platform VeVe was inaccurate, with many Immutable X users being mistakenly classified as VeVe users. The list was supposed to help differentiate between the two groups. VeVe holds its users\u2019 private keys, and airdrop-eligible VeVe users would not have had the information needed for the claims process, so Starknet airdropped the token through the NFT platform. With the list now fixed, Immutable X users who performed eight or more transactions before June 1, 2022, can now claim their airdrop. Starknet is still discussing airdrops for VeVe users with the VeVe team. There was also an issue for pooled ETH stakers, with the staking protocols unable to airdrop STRK to those eligible \u2014 something Starknet said could be traced back to several causes. Some staking protocols have given Starknet a list of users eligible to claim their airdrop starting in April. Related: Starknet populated by airdrop hunters ahead of token launch The updated airdrop schedule is yet another change by Starknet, which changed its unlock schedule in February after concerns that the original plan allowed investors to dump their holdings on retail users. Early contributors and investors got lumped together with smaller and spaced-out STRK distributions over three years instead of a larger drop scheduled for April. STRK\u2019s airdrop was also widely criticized by Starknet users who claimed they were ineligible despite having made thousands of dollars worth of transactions but missed out due to eligibility criteria mandating the need to hold at least 0.005 ETH \u2014 worth about $10 \u2014 at the time of a snapshot on Nov. 15, 2023. Soon after STRK\u2019s Feb. 20 airdrop, large STRK holders dumped tokens worth millions and its price fell 60% from its $4.40 peak to $1.90 in a little over two days. The price of STRK has struggled to recover and is currently trading at $1.88, according to CoinGecko data. Magazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

According to local news outlet Sahara Reporters, the directive was given in an interim ruling delivered by Justice Emeka Nwite on Feb. 29 following an ex parte motion filed against the cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance by the EFCC. An ex parte motion is one in which only one party is present, and the defense is not given prior notice of the motion, preventing them from presenting an argument. In the motion, the lawyer representing the anti-graft agency, Ekele Iheanacho, contended that Binance\u2019s activities in Nigeria contain elements of criminality. This assertion contravenes Sections 38 of the EFCC Act, 2004, and Section 15 of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 (as amended), which mandates reporting suspicious transactions to authorities, with penalties for non-compliance. In an affidavit, EFCC operative Hamma Bello stated the need for the Commission to conclude its ongoing probe after receiving intelligence on alleged money laundering and terrorism financing involving the Binance crypto exchange platform. Bello stated that on receipt of the intelligence, the EFCC team discovered users using the cryptocurrency platform for illegal activities such as price discovery, confirmation and market manipulation, all of which had resulted in significant distortions in the foreign exchange market and further devalued the naira against other currencies. Related: Biden pressured to intervene in US citizens detention by Nigeria The commission maintained that the adverse effects of these activities on the Nigerian economy were communicated to Binance operators, leading to the request to delist the naira from Binance\u2019s trading platform. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Nathaniel Luz, CEO of Flincap \u2014 a liquidity platform for crypto exchanges \u2014 said that although this court order is an advantage for the Nigerian government, the best course of action between Binance and the Nigerian government would be to have a roundtable conversation on this issue. Bayo Onanuga, presidential adviser on information and strategy, argued that Binance and other crypto platforms manipulated the naira and triggered a massive decline in the local fiat currency. The official also suggested banning platforms like Binance in the country. Nigeria has emerged as one of the fastest-growing crypto economies in the world in the past few years. It is also the second-biggest economy in the world in terms of crypto adoption in 2023.

On March 19, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers Marc Mukasey and Torrey Young wrote to Judge Lewis Kaplan in response to the government\u2019s sentencing proposal, handed down on March 15. \u201cWith marked hostility, the memorandum distorts reality to support its precious \u2018loss\u2019 narrative and casts Sam as a depraved super-villain.\u201d On March 15, United States prosecutors filed additional documents alongside a sentencing memorandum that proposed a 40-to-50-year sentence for the former crypto billionaire, who was convicted on fraud and money laundering charges in November 2023. The lawyers claimed the proposed sentence adopted \u201ca medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.\u201d \u201cThat is not justice,\u201d they added and instead proposed a reduced sentence of five to six years in prison. The lawyers made several arguments to justify a reduced sentence for Bankman-Fried. They argued that there were no actual losses as the bankruptcy proceedings would result in all customers and lenders being made whole, with assets remaining in the estate. Additionally, the lawyers argued that prosecutors falsely portrayed Bankman-Fried as greedy and driven by a desire to maximize personal wealth, contrasting this with his philanthropic efforts and supposedly modest lifestyle. The pair also disputed the government\u2019s claims that Bankman-Fried posed a high risk of re-offending, citing research on low recidivism rates for white-collar, educated offenders without prior records.

In a March 19 post to X, Capriole Fund founder Charles Edwards said it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to have a lot of volatility in the months on either side of the Bitcoin halving, speculating that the 12-month period following the event would be the best \u201crisk-reward\u201d timeframe for investors. As part of his Bitcoin halving 2024 prediction, Edwards posited there would be a shutdown of inefficient miners in the wake of the Bitcoin halving event \u2014 which is slated to occur sometime between April 18 and 20. Bitcoin briefly fell to $61,593 on March 20 and is currently trading at $62,690, per CoinGecko data.

Related: Will the Bitcoin halving bring more institutional investors into crypto? The price of Bitcoin pulled back roughly 50% in the months before the 2020 halving, but the declines were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in March. However, it spent the rest of that halving year consolidating around $10,000 before the bull market resumed in 2021. Looking back further, Bitcoin prices retreated 33% around the time of 2016 halving before making gains at the end of the year and surging into a bull market in 2017, where it peaked at $20,000. However, 2024 is largely uncharted territory for halvings, which previously occurred well below BTC\u2019s relative peak price and did not have the significant institutional backing provided by spot Bitcoin ETFs.

On a March 19 episode of the Unchained Podcast, Davies reiterated his lack of remorse for the collapse of 3AC and remained adamant that his professional reputation was still intact despite receiving outsized backlash for his past misdeeds on social media. \u201cAm I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No. Like, companies go bankrupt all the time,\u201d said Davies, laughing. \u201cMaybe at a minimum, we could tell the next Three Arrows how to do things better when they go bankrupt,\u201d added Davies in response to a question about his future plans. Davies said he would make efforts to avoid returning to Singapore in a bid to avoid risking jail time and claimed he was \u201cin Europe\u201d when asked his whereabouts adding that he \u201cbounced around between Europe and Asia.\u201d He claimed to New York Magazine last month that he was residing in Portugal. In April 2023, Davies and Su Zhu announced the launch of OPNX, a hybrid bankruptcy claims platform and crypto exchange. In the podcast, Davies described the launch of the company as \u201cvery impressive\u201d and asserted that he remained a well-respected figure within the crypto industry. On Feb. 1, OPNX said it would be ceasing all operations and shutting down completely by Feb. 14. Davies also claimed the allegations from Teneo \u2014 the firm in charge of 3AC\u2019s liquidation \u2014 that he and co-founder Su Zhu were \u201cnot cooperating\u201d were exaggerated. It was \u201cliterally the liquidator\u2019s job\u201d to make it appear as though the pair were being uncooperative in a bid to recover more funds, Davies said. On Jan. 5, 2023, Davies and Zhu were subpoenaed via Twitter messages due to the pair avoiding communication with the relevant authorities and \u201cnot yielding satisfactory cooperation\u201d with liquidators at the time. Related: OPNX to shut down with mysterious new exchange as replacement On Dec. 21, a British Virgin Islands court froze $1.14 billion o worth of Davies and Zhu\u2019s assets.

Teneo is currently seeking to recover $1.3 billion directly from Zhu and Davies, claiming they took on significant amounts of leverage with investor funds after 3AC became insolvent. In September last year, Singapore\u2019s central bank issued nine-year prohibition orders to Davies and Zhu over alleged violations of the country\u2019s securities laws while they operated 3AC.

May 24 is the SEC\u2019s final decision for ARK 21Shares, while Hashdex\u2019s application will face the regulator\u2019s ultimatum on or before May 30. Analysts have recently turned sour on the chances of approval for the eight currently proposed Ether ETFs from BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a March 19 X post that he\u2019s grown increasingly concerned due to a lack of engagement between the SEC and the issuers. \u201cMy cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months,\u201d Seyffart wrote. \u201cWe now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round.\u201d Last week, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas lowered the Ether ETF approval odds from 50% to 35%.

Following the second rejection, ETH underwent a 20% correction, testing the $3,200 support on March 19. Analysts suggest that the initial rally was fueled by overly leveraged long positions. Ether\u2019s bullish momentum faded following the forced liquidation of $375 million in ETH futures over the past week, but the question remains whether this is sufficient for Ether to stop the correction and potentially kick-start a bull run again. Ether's downturn was more pronounced than the broader cryptocurrency market's performance, which saw its market capitalization peak at $2.77 trillion on March 14, stabilizing around $2.35 trillion, a 15.5% drop over five days. Ether's relative performance suffered due to Bitcoin's (BTC) 12% weekly drop, Solana's (SOL) 21% increase, and Binance Coin's (BNB) slight 2% decrease during the same timeframe. Interestingly, Solana faced challenges with increased fees and failed transactions as the network struggled to manage the surge in activity, mainly driven by a significant interest in new memecoins. Cointelegraph reported that traders injected approximately $100 million into new Solana memecoins within just three days. The Ethereum network underwent its most significant upgrade in over a year on March 13, coinciding with Ether's price peak for the cycle in 2024. The hard fork greatly reduced transaction fees for layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, thus enhancing Ethereum's scalability. The introduction of data blobs also improved the network's data-handling capabilities. This upgrade should be viewed as a success, evidenced by the surge in activity on layer-2 solutions to an all-time high, averaging 122 transactions per second (TPS) over the last two days, according to L2beat. This represents a 31% increase from the previous week and is more than eight times the base layer capacity of Ethereum at 15 TPS. Despite the anticipation surrounding Ethereum's network upgrades, the base layer gas fees have remained a significant issue, with the average cost hovering around $12 on March 18, according to BitInfoCharts. This situation highlights the continuing appeal of alternative platforms like Solana and Avalanche (AVAX). Notably, these were among the few cryptocurrencies in the top 20 to see gains over the past week. On a positive note, the 20% correction in Ether since March 13 has led to the ETH perpetual contract funding rate approaching nearly zero. This indicates a balance in demand between those holding long positions and those shorting, suggesting a market equilibrium. The funding rate's dip to its lowest level in three weeks at 0.014% per 8-hour period, equivalent to 0.3% over seven days, starkly contrasts with the previous week. Then, buyers were facing a 1.2% fee to keep their positions open for a week. This significant shift indicates a cooling off from the previously heated buying enthusiasm. Related: Why is Ethereum (ETH) price down today? To understand whether professional traders have also changed to a neutral stance, one should analyze the monthly futures. Typically, in such markets, futures trade at a 5% to 10% premium over spot exchanges, reflecting the cost of carrying the investment until settlement. Ether's futures have been trading at a 22% premium, an unusually high premium that suggests an excessive demand for long positions, possibly driven by optimism regarding the upcoming decisions on Ethereum's spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Remarkably, this optimism persists unabated, even after Ether's price correction to $3,200 on March 19, which could be seen as a bullish signal amidst the broader market recalibration.

The platform uses adaptive sharding to improve performance without compromising user experience or security. The blockchain ecosystem is poised for refreshed growth driven by the influx of new users. Since the Bitcoin halving in 2020, the blockchain tech market has increased from $4.19 billion to $19.36 billion in 2023, and the next halving is slated for April 2024. The success story of 2024 is expected to be written by the user base expansion fueled by the crypto market explosion following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. According to analysts, if bullish market conditions persist, global crypto users could jump by 50% in a year and rise to 900 million in 2024. Since only 3.9% of the global population is estimated to use blockchain, continued growth in the sector is inevitable. This is where blockchain scalability becomes critical. A distributed blockchain network designed for next-generation applications, MultiversX, scales according to demand, making it possible to expand without affecting the user experience. The platform aims to adapt to the expected influx of new participants in the blockchain space and enable the system to handle the increased load without losing performance or seeing fees increase. The lack of scalability, often considered the Achilles heel of traditional blockchain protocols, results in high fees and low transaction speeds whenever a significant increase is experienced in user demand. MultiversX addresses the need for scalability challenges by using adaptive state sharding, which allows the network to scale dynamically.  Offering adaptive state sharding for scalability, MultiversX uses the energy-efficient consensus mechanism called Secure Proof of Stake. Sharding is a method of dividing the blockchain network into smaller pieces, each of which can process transactions independently. MultiversX takes sharding technology one step further, implementing all its types, such as network sharding, transaction sharding and state sharding. Different sharding methods that increase scalability on a case-by-case basis spread the workload across the network while preserving the principle of decentralization. Security has become critical with the arrival of new users in the blockchain space, an area on which MultiversX places significant importance. The protocol implements a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution that adds a unique layer of security on top of the traditional protections provided by wallets to increase users\u2019 security. Known as the Guardians feature, it further reinforces security, safeguarding user funds even when private keys are compromised and protecting them at all times, even when mistakes are made - almost inevitable in the journey of a Web3 user. MultiversX\u2019s goals include developing an environment that will empower enterprises and institutions and support highly demanding use cases. Developers can deploy customized blockchain solutions using Sovereign Shards\u2014independent but seamlessly interconnected shards within the MultiversX network. These pieces operate similarly to application-specific blockchains but benefit from trustless interoperability and unified user experience across the MultiversX ecosystem.  Sovereign Shards are independent shards built on top of the MultiversX blockchain. Focusing primarily on scalability, user safety, and developer flexibility, MultiversX is reportedly set to undergo several major network upgrades this year that will improve its transactions per second (TPS) capacity by 3 to 6 times via optimistic aggregation, early block proposals, equivalent proofs, and changes around the consensus. The core development team is also focused on accelerating the ecosystem expansion and organizing different initiatives for builders, such as hackathons and demo days while having an increased presence worldwide through local meetups and large blockchain and tech conferences. Working to improve blockchain performance and efficiency, MultiversX wants to facilitate the next growth phase of the Web3 space. \u201cThe end goal was always to propose solutions that resolve pressing issues, not just for Web3, but for the financial system, gaming, music, art and entertainment,\u201d said MultiversX CEO Beniamin Mincu, adding: \u201cSolutions with superior performance, greater security, and a better user experience will enable blockchain technology to create impact across sectors, industries and businesses, bringing important value for users, enterprises and the private sector.\u201d","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Blockchain, #Adoption, #Scalability, #Web3"},{"date":"Mar 19, 2024","summary":"","author":"Cointelegraph","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/history-of-crypto-introduction","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"History of Crypto: A timeline of events that shaped the future of money","type":"Blog","category":"Overview","content":"Discover the thrilling world of cryptocurrency through Cointelegraph's immersive \u201cHistory of Crypto\u201d timeline, brought to you in partnership with Phemex.

Established as a financial tool to support liquidity and stability within banking institutions, the BTFP plays a crucial role in the broader financial ecosystem. The program ended on March 11 as BTC price hit a new all-time high three days later. However, market participants and observers are now closely watching the end of BTFP's possible repercussions on asset prices, particularly in the volatile crypto market. The BTFP, by providing loans against high-quality securities, aimed to bolster banks\u2019 confidence and liquidity, ensuring they could meet depositors' demands without resorting to the sale of assets at distressed prices. This mechanism indirectly supported broader financial markets by maintaining a level of liquidity and stability. However, with its ending, there could be shifts in market dynamics, including the potential for increased volatility in traditional financial markets. Bitcoin, often touted as \"digital gold\" and a hedge against traditional financial market instability, could see varied impacts from the cessation of the BTFP. One possible outcome is an increase in Bitcoin's price, driven by investors seeking alternative stores of value amid renewed volatility in traditional markets. This flight to safety could enhance Bitcoin\u2019s appeal, reinforcing its status as a viable alternative investment. The ongoing fragility in the banking system, highlighted by the BTFP, could bolster Bitcoin's price and narrative as a safe haven asset, much like during the 2023 banking crisis, according to Jonathan Solomon, the co-founder and co-CEO of ARIA algorithmic rating investment firm. He told Cointelegraph: With the banking sector's stability still in question and the BTFP concluding, there's a perceived risk to the banking sector that could, in turn, positively influence Bitcoin's appeal. The potential for Bitcoin to attract more investors is now even greater, given the availability of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, which wasn't the case in March 2023. Conversely, the end of the BTFP could also lead to tightening liquidity conditions in traditional markets, prompting investors to liquidate riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, to cover positions in more traditional markets. This scenario could result in downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, at least in the short term, as market participants adjust to the new liquidity environment. Moreover, the end of the BTFP could influence investor sentiment and risk appetite across financial markets. In a landscape where liquidity is perceived to be decreasing, risk aversion could increase, potentially dampening the appetite for high-volatility assets like Bitcoin. This sentiment-driven factor could play a significant role in Bitcoin's price movements post-BTFP. Tighter liquidity conditions could impact investor appetite towards digital assets like Bitcoin, according to Terence Kwok, the founder of Human Institute. Kwok told Cointelegraph: \"In scenarios where investors perceive increased market risk or face liquidity constraints, they might reallocate their investments towards safer assets, potentially affecting Bitcoin's price negatively in the short term.\" However, the end of BTFP could have no direct, short-term effect on Bitcoin price, and any indirect effects would take months to materialize, according to Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia International digital asset investment firm. Greco told Cointelegraph: The conclusion of BTFP could potentially strain the banking system, particularly smaller banks, which might have repercussions on the banking sector and, consequently, the macroeconomic landscape. This could indirectly affect risk-on assets like BTC, but the magnitude and timing of such an impact are uncertain. Bitcoin price fell over 12% during the past week to $63,124 as of 1:33 p.m. in UTC amid net negative flows for Bitcoin ETFs. This trend correction aligns with Bitcoin's historic pre-halving price patterns and broader financial markets, according to Avhit Bij, the co-founder of Apex Alpha Academy. He told Cointelegraph: \"The closure of the BTFP will surely dampen liquidity within the sphere and increase callback rates from profits. However, the long view is that BTC is the chosen asset for a hedge against fiat, and considering that institutions and retail are primarily looking at BTC, we will overcome the short-term waves that could come through. Bitcoin has officially entered its historical pre-halving retracement zone, in line with the 20% correction from 2020 and the 40% correction in 2016, according to pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital, who wrote in a March 19 X (formerly Twitter) post: \"Currently, $BTC is approximately 28 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -14% in total since last week.\" It's also important to consider the broader macroeconomic context, including interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events, which will continue to influence Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. The interaction between these factors and the end of the BTFP could create complex market dynamics, making it challenging to predict Bitcoin's price direction with certainty. Therefore, while the end of the Bank Term Funding Program marks a significant moment for financial markets, its direct impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price is multifaceted and uncertain. Factors such as market liquidity, investor sentiment, and broader economic conditions will all play a role in shaping the BTC price trajectory in a post-BTFP world.

The working group will seek to strengthen alignment between service developers and organizational users. Citi and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) are new foundation members. They join 133 current members, including banks, central banks, tech firms, nonprofits, educational institutions and retailers. Members can support the foundation financially or through \u201csweat equity,\u201d executive director Daniela Barbosa told Cointelegraph. Their support ensures the continuation of the foundation\u2019s 13 projects, and the code they produce is enterprise-grade. A large portion of the financing Hyperledger receives goes toward providing training for expert users, who are experiencing greater demand as the foundation\u2019s products are adopted, Barbosa said. Hyperledger Besu is Java-based software with an extractable implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was initially developed by Consensys, which contributed to the Hyperledger Foundation in 2019. The code from all 13 Hyperledger projects was contributed by companies, Barbosa said. Related: ETH Merge will change the way enterprises view Ethereum for business Contributing code to an open-source foundation is common when a company does not want to be the sole developer of software. Open-sourcing a project makes development faster and enables a larger ecosystem to be formed. Barbosa adde: \u201cAs more and more companies, governments and different organizations take this code and bring it into production, they need partners and vendors to support them in that journey.\u201d Hyperledger works with 35 vendors. Besu users need a diversity of vendors and partners for a healthy marketplace, Barbosa continued. She noted that some of Hyperledger\u2019s projects, such as Besu and Fabric, have overlapping features. Open sourcing allows companies to collaborate on the development of noncommercial features of software. The new Besu working group will be chaired by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which is already a premier-level member of the foundation. Other members, not all of which are foundation members, include Accenture, Banco Central do Brasil, Consensys, Citi, Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, Mastercard, Santander and Visa.

ENS\u2019s founder spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph at ETHGlobal in London, reflecting on the development of the project that allows users to create human-readable Web3 addresses that can double up as a Web3 wallet for cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs), as well as a domain for decentralized websites. The New Zealand-born software engineer worked for Google before being introduced to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Johnson said he was drawn to Ethereum due to its programmability: \u201cI learned about Bitcoin not long after it came out. I initially thought this was really cool, but then I realized it is just money. There\u2019s no programmability here.\u201d Johnson began to tinker with Ethereum coding in his personal capacity. A strong background in infrastructure, tooling and libraries allowed Johnson to write his own Ethereum strings library. A string is a programming data type representing text rather than numbers. This is typically a sequence of characters containing letters, numbers, symbols and spaces. Front-end software engineer Jeffrey Jenkinson described string manipulation as one of the most complicated tasks in software. \u201cAnything that is human-readable can be considered a string, and when developers write code that needs to be parsed into machine language, that starts with string manipulation,\u201d Jenkinson told Cointelegraph. The Ethereum Foundation eventually hired Johnson, and one of his first projects was to start work on the name service. Initially working for the EthSwarm team \u2014 its in-house decentralized data storage and distribution technology \u2014 Johnson was charged with addressing a gap in the infrastructure. \u201cThere was a shortfall they had identified; their content needed naming. I said, well, so does everything else, accounts and so on. So that became my project there. When I moved off the swarm team and onto the Go Ethereum team, I kept it on as my side project,\u201d Johnson said. The Ethereum Foundation encouraged Johnson to work full-time on the project by creating a separate organization funded by a grant. The ENS founder drew up rough figures to support a two-year roadmap with a small team. That\u2019s where Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin intervened, as Johnson explains: \u201cThey took it to Vitalik, and he said, \u2018No, that\u2019s not nearly enough, take twice as much.\u2019 That's how it started. If he hadn\u2019t got involved, ENS would have sputtered and failed.\u201d Users have registered over two million ENS addresses since the service went live. For Johnson, this metric is not as crucial as others, which are arguably more difficult to measure. He would prefer to better gauge what portion of users are entering crypto addresses into their wallets instead of DNS names: \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s almost impossible to directly measure. So instead, we have to look at things like adoption in terms of number of names, registrations and renewals.\u201d While he anticipates a gradual growth in the number of registered ENS names, Johnson says the team focuses on taking the service to networks that could benefit from Web3 utility. Related: Ethereum Name Service founder reflects as 2 million registration mark nears \u201cENS needs to come to users where they are, so to speak. If there is a new distributed content network that is being widely used by users, then ENS should support it.

ENS intends to roll out Ethereum layer-2 infrastructure in the next couple of years, and Johnson hopes to make the service more \u201cplug-and-play\u201d friendly.

This is the question for traders and analysts as downside momentum continues across crypto markets. After successive new all-time highs, Bitcoin is testing the resilience of levels only recently reclaimed as support. So far, a reliable floor has not been found. Market observers are thus outlining more fundamental lines in the sand, while also planning for a potential relief bounce. Some argue that the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rates decision, due March 20, will be a decisive event that alleviates pressure on oversold crypto assets. The run-up to previous meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has often seen risk-asset suppression in the past. Cointelegraph takes a look at some popular bets when it comes to BTC/USD in the short term. In a repeat of the move, which followed its first new all-time high earlier this month, Bitcoin is rapidly headed toward the $60,000 zone. This is the critical point on traders\u2019 radars, and one which has not received a convincing retest. \u201cI think we at least get a sweep of last weeks low,\u201d popular trader George summarized on X. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t hold I think we see sub 60k again.\u201d Fellow trader Ali used realized price distribution (URPD) to show where the current set of unspent transaction outputs, or UTXOs, were created.

On March 18, the developer of the Slerf project drew widespread attention after claiming to have accidentally burned a pre-sale allocation of 53,000 Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) tokens intended to be airdropped to early investors. The Slerf developer posted \u201coh fuck\u201d on X upon realizing his mistake before following up with an explanation and \u201cI am so fucking sorry\u201d in a post 10 minutes later. Slerf\u2019s posts then went from apologetic to awe as volumes of the token spiked over $2 billion in trading volume in the hours after. However, some skeptics are pointing to several suspicious trades as evidence the supposedly mistaken burn event may have been intentional to garner attention \u2014 though the evidence is mostly circumstantial. Solana community developer Gary Henderson claimed the Slerf burn appears to have been doctored and pointed to the Slerf creator\u2019s wallet removing 1,050 SOL from the liquidity pool just before the liquidity was burned. Henderson said this strongly suggests the Slerf dev was aware of the impending burn and decided to remove his funds beforehand. The Slerf developer replied and denied making the move on purpose, saying he had \u201cno intention\u201d of burning the tokens. \u201cThis is true but I had no intention of burning the tokens that were intended from airdrops,\u201d Slerf wrote in a March 19 post to X. Wildcat creator Laurence Day also suggested that the Slerf burn was \u201cnearly certainly intentional\u201d to drum up hype for the project. He explained that someone had stacked $1.9 million into the liquidity pool shortly after the burn and sold it for $5 million, suggesting that insiders could have used the event to profit from the hysteria. However, the Slerf dev has repeatedly explained that the burn was \u201cnot a joke\u201d and was the result of a simple \u201cmindless misclick\u201d during the process of burning the liquidity pool on a tool known as the SOL incinerator. In a March 18 X Space, the developer seemingly broke down in tears and reiterated that the burning of the pre-sale allocation was a stupid mistake. Cointelegraph reached out to Slerf for comment but didn\u2019t receive a response by the time of publication. Related: Solana activity flips Ethereum amid memecoin craze, even as txs fail Regardless of whether the bungled launch was intentional or not, the project has attracted an incredible amount of attention on both social media and throughout the market itself. As of the time of publication, Slerf has generated over $3.2 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours and is currently changing hands for $1.08, touting a total market capitalization of $540 billion. Notably, there is no guarantee investors will actually receive a token from the pre-sale, which is part of the reason why the fundraising model is so popular among scammers and other fraudulent actors. In the last 72 hours, well over $100 million has been raised by Solana memecoin projects using pre-sales.

USDM officially launched on Cardano on March 17 but is currently only available to institutional users. \u201cRetail rollout will likely be in April,\u201d Mehen Finance founding partner Matthew Plomin told Cointelegraph. \u201cWe are in limited launch, calling it \u2018Live mainnet ecosystem early rollout\u2019 internally,\u201d said Plomin, adding that institutions in eligible jurisdictions can now join the platform and start minting the stablecoin. Plomin explained that the USDM model resembles other fiat-backed stablecoins but includes a key feature that prevents excess minting. USDM\u2019s reserve is reported directly to Charli3 \u2014 a decentralized oracle designed for the Cardano network \u2014 with Charli3 oracle data also integrated into the token\u2019s smart contract. This ensures real-time transfers can be made transparently, said Plomin. \u201cThe independently reported oracle value governs the amount of USDM token that can be minted, so excess minting is not possible.\u201d Last July, Mehen also stated that USDM wouldn\u2019t be freezable \u2014 unlike Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). This property makes USDM a superior stablecoin, argues Caleb Montiel, founder of Cardano content platform Cardano Curation. However, the inability to freeze USDM on-chain could backfire, according to crypto commentator Vanessa Harris, warning that regulators could instead freeze USDM bank accounts, which could impact USDM\u2019s peg. Mehen is based in New York, where the state\u2019s financial services regulator has a history of investigating and taking action against some of the largest industry players. The USDM reserve is being held in government-only money market mutual funds at Fidelity and Western Asset Management, said Plomin, who stressed that they\u2019re not being used as banks. Early institutional users are currently sending United States dollars via wire transfer and receiving USDM at a 1:1 ratio. Mehen has obtained licensing approvals from 17 U.S. states with more \u201ccoming soon\u201d and will seek money transmitter and virtual asset service provider licenses in Europe and the United Kingdom later this year. Related: Cardano refutes rumors it abandoned its scaling project Hydra Meanwhile, Plomin revealed that Mehen will soon take on its first investment via a crowdfunded equity raise instead of a token sale. \u201cSecurities offered under [regulated crowdfunding] are available to people around the world, and we are committed to tokenizing our Series A shares on Cardano.\u201d The investment raise will occur on crowdfunding platform ChainRaise.

In a March 18 research bulletin, Kaiko data shows that the liquidity gap, dubbed the \u201cAlameda Gap,\u201d recovered to pre-FTX levels last week due in part to a recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally. Kaiko coined the term \u201cAlameda gap\u201d in November 2022 due to the firm\u2019s role as a large market maker. It refers to a drop in liquidity on global exchanges caused by huge losses incurred by market makers. The collapse caused a substantial decline in available trading liquidity, affecting volumes and market stability, which highlighted the influence of major players in crypto markets in 2022. In its recent note, Kaiko noted the gap persisted for more than a year \u201cas market makers waited on the sidelines for sentiment and trading activity to recover.\u201d However, Kaiko said that as of last week, Bitcoin\u2019s 2% market depth is up by 40% year-to-date and briefly surpassed its pre-FTX average of $470 million. \u201cAs of last week, market depth has almost fully recovered and is back to its pre-FTX average,\u201d it noted. The firm attributed this to the surge in BTC prices, which have gained 60% since the beginning of this year and notched a new all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. Meanwhile, Kaiko also reported that BTC/USD spreads on three major exchanges available in the United States \u2014 Coinbase, Kraken and Bitstamp \u2014 have also declined, \u201csuggesting liquidity conditions are meaningfully improving.\u201d The change in spreads could partly be due to structural reasons, it noted before concluding that the cost of trading in the U.S. is now much cheaper. A spread is the difference between the asking price and the bidding price of an asset.

The SEC initially filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice, but that was denied by Judge Robert J. Shelby, who slammed the regulator for intentionally lying to the court about evidence it obtained to secure a temporary restraining order (TRO) and freeze of Debt Box\u2019s assets last August. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s above-discussed conduct constitutes a gross abuse of the power entrusted to it by Congress and substantially undermined the integrity of these proceedings and the judicial process,\u201d Shelby said in the March 18 filing. The \u201ccritical evidence\u201d the SEC offered to have obtained \u201clacked any basis,\u201d which was nonetheless advanced in \u201cdeliberately false and misleading ways,\u201d Shelby explained. \u201cThe bad faith in inextricable from the abusive conduct and a sanction of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for all expenses resulting from that conduct is appropriate,\u201d said Shelby. In its August lawsuit, the SEC claimed Debt Box perpetrated a $50-million fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme amid its operations as a software mining license provider. In requesting the TRO and asset freeze, the regulator claimed Debt Box had already sent $720,000 overseas and would flee to the United Arab Emirates and secretly transfer more assets with it if it was notified of the order. The request was initially approved. However, Shelby later reviewed his initial order and concluded the SEC misrepresented evidence and that the $720,000 transfer was instead sent within the United States. In December, Judge Shelby gave the SEC a \u201cshow cause order\u201d \u2014 a type of court order that requires a party to justify, explain or prove something to the court. While the SEC accepted its actions weren\u2019t \u201cforthcoming,\u201d the regulator argued a sanction wasn\u2019t appropriate. Related: US senators call SEC actions in Debt Box case \u2018unconscionable\u2019 Shelby took aim at SEC attorney Michael Welsh for misleading the court and attempting to obfuscate: \u201cWelsh knew his statement from the TRO hearing was incorrect.

A message shared by X user MartyParty showed a screenshot of a customer support message that appears to confirm that USDT trading pairs are no longer supported in the European market. Per the post: \u201cWe would like to inform you that the availability of USDT trading pairs in your current region has been discontinued. Please note that not all tokens are supported in all markets due to regulatory requirements. [\u2026] Moving forward, only EUR and USDC pairs will be accessible for spot trading.\u201d The message went on to mention that over 30 new euro spot trading pairs will launch on OKX amid the USDT trading pair removals. It remains unclear as of the time of this article\u2019s publication exactly what provoked the reported delistings. Neither OKX nor Tether sent immediate responses to requests for further information by Cointelegraph. Speculation abounds on social media that the delisting is related to stablecoin rules included in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. While the aforementioned customer support message didn\u2019t specifically state this to be the case, it did mention that \u201cregulatory requirements\u201d were responsible for the disparity in token listings across geographic areas. As Cointelegraph recently reported, EU regulators published draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures on March 14. While an update to complaint reporting seems relatively innocuous, the push for further legislation this late into the first quarter of 2024 could be troublesome for exchanges attempting to align compliance with the new rules. The EU\u2019s MiCA legislation is expected to take effect by the end of 2024, but stablecoin rules are slated for launch ahead of the comprehensive laws package in the second quarter of 2024.

EU financial regulators also want to add more stablecoin regulation guidelines under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework by publishing draft regulatory standards for issuers of stablecoins when dealing with complaints.

These guidelines detail the procedures and standards for stablecoin issuers to manage complaints effectively. Meanwhile, United States President Joe Biden has revived the idea of a 30% tax on electricity used by crypto miners in his administration\u2019s budget proposal for 2025. If implemented, crypto mining companies must report the amount and type of electricity they use. In addition, firms must report the value of the electricity used if they purchase it externally. Meanwhile, miners who lease computational capacity would be mandated to report the value of the electricity of the company that leased them the capacity. The value would then serve as the tax base. This proposal would be effective for taxable years after Dec. 31, 2024. The government will introduce the tax in three phases: 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year and 30% in the third year. The government of Nigeria is reportedly pressing Binance to provide information on its top 100 users in the country amid an ongoing crackdown on the exchange. In addition to data on Binance\u2019s top 100 users, Nigerian authorities have requested that Binance hand over its transaction history for the past six months. In response to Binance\u2019s effort to find a dialogue with Nigerian authorities, the local prosecutors detained two senior Binance executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla. The execs remain detained even after Binance delisted all naira transactions and stopped peer-to-peer naira transactions in late February. Opinions in the local crypto community vary; some support the government\u2019s actions, while others disagree. In an interview with Cointelegraph, local crypto analyst Rume Ophi said that the government was well within its rights, as requests like this are always made when trying to investigate national security matters. However, Ophi\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t sit well with that of other local crypto enthusiasts who took to X to express their disagreement.

Currently, opinions are mixed, and while the excessive leverage in Bitcoin futures has been resolved, investors are still pondering if BTC will be able to surpass its all-time high of $73,755. Many believe that investors are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy meeting on March 20 before deciding to invest more in cryptocurrencies, despite the widespread expectation that interest rates will remain unchanged. This decision goes beyond short-term considerations, focusing on the Fed\u2019s confidence in the economy\u2019s ongoing strength. Another key uncertainty for Bitcoin investors is when the Fed will cease reducing its $7.5 trillion balance sheet. Generally, a more expansive Fed monetary policy indicates more money in circulation, which is beneficial for risk-on assets. The U.S. monetary base represents currency and reserves within the banking system. Higher interest rates typically aim to stabilize or decrease this figure. By diminishing the appeal for businesses to borrow and grow, this contractionary economic strategy usually helps control inflation. Some analysts speculate that Bitcoin\u2019s potential bull run in 2024 relies heavily on the Fed transitioning from a contractionary to an expansive monetary policy. This shift could be prompted by inflation falling below 3% or signs of an economic downturn. Therefore, if interest rates remain elevated for an extended period, the likelihood of a Bitcoin surge decreases. Excessive leverage has also caused unease among Bitcoin investors, particularly as the open interest in BTC futures hit a record high in March, increasing from $22.2 billion on Feb. 25 to $35.5 billion on March 14. Moreover, the imbalance in leverage demand led to distortions that are rarely sustainable. Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, incorporate a rate that is recalculated every eight hours. A positive funding rate signals a rising demand for leverage among those holding long positions. An unusually high funding rate of 0.09% was observed on March 11, equivalent to 1.7% per week. This indicator declined as bulls faced $370 million in liquidations from March 13 to March 15. While these figures may seem significant at first glance, considering Bitcoin\u2019s open interest is at $34.8 billion, it translates to approximately 1% of positions being forcibly closed. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s funding rate dropped to 0.25% per week on March 15, considered neutral in a market where traders are typically bullish. This indicates that there was no excessive demand for short positions, suggesting that bears were hesitant to bet against Bitcoin prices falling below $65,000. Related: Bitcoin to enter pre-halving \u2019danger zone,\u2019 but crypto CEOs remain bullish To verify whether the decreased demand for leveraged long positions accurately reflects market sentiment, it's essential to compare this data with the demand for stablecoins in China, a critical indicator of retail investors entering or exiting the crypto markets. The USD Coin (USDC) premium measures the difference between the value of USDC in peer-to-peer transactions and the official U.S. dollar rate. The USDC premium has been above 3% for the past week, indicating that the stablecoin is trading at a value higher than its pegged rate. Most notably, this premium has not fallen below its fair value even amid the recent price correction to $64,545 on March 17. This trend signifies ongoing demand for cryptocurrencies in China, supporting the positive Bitcoin funding rate favoring long positions and indicating no signs of a bearish trend or investor apprehension.

It created a polarized market for retail crypto investors, and we\u2019re about to see a major rebalancing as a result. On one hand, we have mom-and-pop investors who are now getting exposure to Bitcoin via their advisers investing in spot BTC ETFs for the first time ever. It\u2019s only a matter of time until Bitcoin becomes as common in these household portfolios as gold. On the other hand, though, we have the \u201cOGs\u201d of the crypto market \u2014 those that have been around since the early days and fully subscribe to the ethos of Web3. They invest in Bitcoin because of its decentralization and censorship resistance. But now that every man and his dog are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, they\u2019ve lost their first-mover advantage \u2014 and they're about to revolt. From the point of view of an early Bitcoin investor, the world's biggest crypto asset has, indeed, strayed far from its original purpose \u2014 to replace the existing broken payments system. Inadvertently, it has now become part of the very system it was designed to subvert. It would be a little like discovering a hidden gem of a restaurant, only to see it explode in popularity and be taken over by a large corporation. The quality would drop, the original purpose be all but forgotten, and you\u2019d struggle to get a seat at the table. Related: Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility It\u2019s not just about the purpose of Bitcoin, though. As more and more buyers vie for an increasingly limited supply of this finite asset, Bitcoin\u2019s price will soar, but it\u2019ll be the big boys that benefit, as even the 25 basis points they earn for managing the BTC spot ETFs will bring in billions. Sure, the crypto-savvy retail buyers will still be able to get their hands on Bitcoin directly via crypto exchanges, but giving up most of the profits to the world\u2019s biggest asset managers isn\u2019t what Web3 has ever been about. So we are witnessing a polarization of the crypto market into the mom-and-pop investors willing to pay the ticket price to ride the Bitcoin train, and those that are used to getting this ride for free. These latter investors won\u2019t stick around to see if the ride is worth the fee, they will simply go elsewhere \u2014 a part of the market that remains true to the ethos of crypto and offers intermediary-free access to the world of blockchain. This will be the catalyst for the much-anticipated altcoin season. The Bitcoin maxis diversifying their portfolios, the crypto OGs looking for bigger and better returns as Bitcoin becomes mainstream, and the true believers in crypto\u2019s decentralized dream. So far, altcoins have lagged Bitcoin in terms of performance, as is common during this part of the cycle. But we\u2019re beginning to see signs of a reversal. Over the last 10 weeks or so, Ethereum (ETH) has been posting higher highs and higher lows against Bitcoin, meaning we could be in for a breakout sometime in the coming weeks. When this happens, altcoins will follow \u2014 as they always do \u2014 and it will be the Bitcoin investors seeking alternatives that drive this transition. In fact, the more institutions dive into Bitcoin and the more traditional investors add it to their portfolios, the more polarized the crypto retail market will become. And amid this re-allocation of assets into altcoins, we will see several of them rise into the \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d ranks that have, until now, really only been the realm of Bitcoin. This cycle will be a decisive one in sorting the wheat from the chaff and determining which alts will live to see another bull market. Related: Curb your enthusiasm \u2014 crypto prices aren't going to move as quickly as you think That\u2019s not to say that every crypto-savvy retail investor will flee Bitcoin entirely. After all, altcoin investing requires a relatively strong stomach. For most, Bitcoin will become the balancer \u2014 the reliable and less volatile core in their portfolios that provides the buffer for higher-risk investments. But as the Bitcoin behemoth grows, we can expect the asset to lose some of its most dedicated OGs, as they head off in search of more decentralized alternatives and bigger gains. However this rebalancing plays out, one thing is clear: the institutions will profit either way. Even a major retail exodus will have very little impact on BTC\u2019s price direction now \u2014 the scarcity, growing demand, and billions of institutional inflows will take care of that. It will, however, have a profound effect on the future of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. With only just over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL) to date \u2014 against Bitcoin\u2019s growing $1.4 trillion market cap \u2014 even a relatively insignificant rotation into altcoins could have a major impact on DeFi\u2019s growth. If Bitcoin maxis turn to altcoins with the same fervor they've dedicated to BTC since launch, we\u2019re about to see some explosive growth in altcoins.

Interestingly, Ether (ETH) and other altcoin investment products have not been as popular with investors, with their year-to-date inflows combined amounting to a tiny fraction of the total that has gone into Bitcoin. Furthermore, despite an all-time high ETF inflow, the price of Bitcoin has tumbled by 7% in the past week and now trades at $67,418 at the time of publication.

However, Bitcoin may come under renewed selling pressure if history repeats itself. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital said in a X post that Bitcoin was about to enter the \u201cDanger Zone\u201d when it tends to correct. That period happens to be 14 to 28 days leading up to the halving, which is expected on April 20 in this cycle. In 2020, Bitcoin had fallen 20% during the said period, while in 2016, the correction was 40%. Analysts will closely monitor the inflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If inflows remain steady during a pullback in Bitcoin, then the likelihood of the uptrend continuing remains high. However, if inflows dry up considerably, then the next leg of the uptrend may get delayed. What are the important support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out. The S&P 500 Index turned down from 5,180 last week but bounced off the support line of the ascending channel pattern. The bulls will try to propel the price above the overhead resistance of 5,189. If they succeed, the index may climb to the channel\u2019s resistance line. This level is likely to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from the resistance line, the index may remain inside the channel for some more time. The uptrend could accelerate if buyers thrust the price above the channel. The index could then jump to 5,450. On the downside, a break below the 20-day exponential moving average (5,100) could start a decline toward the 50-day simple moving average (4,972). The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has pulled back to the moving averages, indicating solid buying at lower levels. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price stays above the moving averages, the index could rise to 105, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the index to 102. This level is likely to attract strong buying because if it cracks, the index may drop to 101. Bitcoin bounced off the 20-day EMA ($65,830) on March 17, indicating that the bulls continue to buy on dips to strong support levels. The BTC/USDT pair faces resistance at the breakdown level from the ascending channel pattern. If the price turns lower and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the bears have flipped the channel\u2019s support line into resistance. That increases the risk of a fall to $59,000. Instead, if the bulls push the price back into the channel, it will suggest that the markets have rejected the breakdown. The bulls will again try to drive the pair to $73,777. A break above this level will open the doors for a potential rise to $80,000. Ether (ETH) plunged below the 20-day EMA ($3,619) on March 16, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels. The bulls are trying to push the price back above the 20-day EMA and trap the aggressive bears. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could attempt a rally toward the overhead resistance of $4,093. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below $3,400, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. The pair could then slide to $3,200 and later to the 50-day SMA ($3,077). Solana (SOL) has been in a strong uptrend for several days, with no signs of a slowdown. The bears tried to start a pullback on March 15, but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip. The price has reached the overhead resistance of $205, which may prove to be a formidable hurdle to cross. However, if the bulls prevail, the SOL/USDT pair could start its journey toward the all-time high of $260. The risk to the upside is that the RSI has risen deep into the overbought territory, suggesting that the rally may be extended in the short term. This points to a possible consolidation or correction in the near term. The support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($156). A break below this level will suggest a short-term trend change. BNB (BNB) has pulled back in a strong uptrend, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $534. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rises above $591, the BNB/USDT pair could retest the overhead resistance at $645. On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below $534, it will suggest that bears are in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair could then tumble to the 20-day EMA ($509). This is a crucial support to watch out for because a break below it may accelerate selling and sink the pair to $460. XRP (XRP) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.62) on March 16, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip. Buyers attempted a recovery on March 17 but could not clear the overhead hurdle at the 20-day EMA. The price has turned lower from the 20-day EMA on March 18, suggesting that the bears are active at higher levels. The XRP/USDT pair could dive to the uptrend line. Meanwhile, the bulls are likely to have other plans. They will try to push the pair above the 20-day EMA and start a robust recovery. The pair could first climb to $0.67 and thereafter to the overhead resistance at $0.74. Related: Ether ETF is less likely than Bitcoin ETF was: Recharge Capital founder Cardano (ADA) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($0.62) on March 17, but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.70) on March 18. The price has turned down from the 20-day EMA, signaling that the bears are selling on rallies. That increases the likelihood of a break below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $0.57. This bearish view will be negated if the price rises and breaks above the 20-day EMA. The bulls will again try to propel the price to the overhead resistance of $0.81. A break and close above this level will suggest the start of the rally to $0.92. Avalanche (AVAX) rebounded sharply off the $50 level on March 17, signaling aggressive buying at lower levels, The bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $61.50 on March 18, indicating the start of the next leg of the uptrend. If buyers sustain the breakout, the AVAX/USDT pair could climb to $87. Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to maintain above $61.50, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair may remain range-bound between $50 and $62 for a few more days. Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted below the $0.15 support on March 16, suggesting that the bears are trying to seize control. The bulls pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA ($0.15) on March 17, but could not build upon this strength. This shows that every recovery attempt is being sold. The bears are trying to sink the price below $0.14 on March 18. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($0.11). If bulls want to prevent the fall, they will have to push and maintain the price above $0.16. That may keep the pair inside the $0.15 to $0.19 range for a while longer.

Users and businesses face significant hurdles that impede wider adoption and integration in the world of crypto. At the forefront of these challenges is the complexity of crypto accounting, which presents a steep learning curve and operational difficulties. The lack of integration with traditional financial systems also creates a divide, making it cumbersome for entities to seamlessly manage digital and fiat currencies. In addition, the burgeoning crypto market demands a heightened need for transparency and security in transactions to protect against fraud and ensure trust. These obstacles highlight the critical need for innovative solutions to bridge the gap between the traditional financial landscape and the digital economy, making crypto more accessible and manageable for all stakeholders involved. Developed by AEM Algorithm, Mr. Journaler \u2014 an NFT-based virtual crypto accountant \u2014 tackles the intricate challenges of crypto accounting head-on. Unlike typical NFT projects focused on digital art or collectibles, Mr. Journaler is developed with the functionality to address the specific needs of financial management within the blockchain industries. The project aims to offer a structured approach to the complexities of crypto accounting and has already established partnerships with Dr. Jinglee, Mutaverse, Foundinals and Canvasland. Mr. Journaler integrates Bitcoin ordinals and NFTs into practical applications for businesses and individuals. The integration combines blockchain\u2019s security and transparency with the functional utility of NFTs in accounting, offering tools and features that facilitate financial management in the Web3 space. Mr. Journaler addresses the complexity of accounting for digital transactions alongside traditional finances by integrating with existing accounting software, such as Xero and QuickBooks. It enables users to track, manage and report on crypto transactions within the same framework as their traditional activities, aiming to streamline the process and reduce the barriers to crypto accounting adoption. Designed to connect the crypto economy with traditional systems, Mr. Journaler\u2019s AEM+ multi-wallet feature supports businesses-to-business and consumers-to-businesses transactions. The feature allows crypto and fiat currencies to be managed through a single interface.  Mr. Journaler utilizes Bitcoin Ordinals to introduce NFTs tailored for crypto-accounting. Source: AEM Algorithm Emphasizing a community-driven approach, Mr. Journaler plans to develop into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) \u2014 an organization run by its members through consensus on a blockchain, removing the need for centralized control and enabling transparent, collective decision-making. Mr. Journaler has also announced plans for DApp staking proposals in partnership with Astar for zkEVM integration, referring to an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible with zero-knowledge proofs. Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic method allowing one party to prove to another they know a value without revealing any information apart from the fact they know that value. The move addresses scalability, privacy and efficiency challenges in an EVM-compatible environment, meaning it can run Ethereum-based applications efficiently.  Variation examples of Mr. Journaler.

By integrating Bitcoin ordinals and NFTs, offering tools for simplified accounting, creating a multi-wallet feature and fostering a community-driven approach, Mr. Journaler supports the integration of crypto transactions into traditional financial management practices.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Adoption, #Community, #Integration, #NFT, #Bitcoin Ordinals, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Mar 18, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zhiyuan Sun","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitget-wallet-launch-native-token-1-year-after-30-m-raise","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitget Wallet to launch native token 1 year after $30M raise","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Cross-chain wallet BitKeep, now known as Bitget Wallet, will be launching its own native token after securing a $30 million investment at a $300 million valuation from the namesake exchange last year. According to the airdrop plan unveiled on March 18, the total supply of BWB is set at 1 billion, with a 5% allocation to users holding digital assets within Bitget Wallet or using in-app swap transactions. The airdrop will feature an initial six-week points reward system, which can be converted to BWB tokens in the second quarter following its initial exchange offering. In addition, users who received rewards from BitKeep wallet before its rebranding last year can convert them to BWB in Q2 at a ratio of 6:10. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us that BWB serves as a key to unlocking exclusive benefits for its holders, offering them a voice in community governance, access to ecosystem airdrops, and a dividend in the rewards,\u201d said Alvin Kan, chief operating officer of Bitget Wallet. Shortly after the announcement, the wallet\u2019s servers experienced a service overload, with users reporting they couldn\u2019t claim their BWB. Bitget Wallet has since clarified that \u201cour team is working hard to repair it and the issue will be resolved soon.\u201d Currently, the wallet is one of the most popular in the Asia-Pacific region, with over 19 million users, and its in-wallet swap functionality supports around 40 blockchains. The move follows the footsteps of Trust Wallet, which also launched its own native token after its acquisition by crypto exchange Binance in 2018. Since its inception in 2020, the TWT token has returned 19,599% with a diluted market cap of $1.3 billion. The wallet reportedly has more than 80 million users. In August 2023, BitKeep rebranded to Bitget Wallet following its controlling-stake acquisition by the latter exchange. At the time, its then-COO Moka Han said that the wallet had secured partnerships with Banxa, Simplex, Alchemy Pay, MoonPay and FaTPay to allow users to purchase cryptocurrencies within the wallet via credit cards, Google Pay and Apple Pay.

The partnership brings streamlined interoperability and functionality for MetaMask users. According to a press release, users who connect their accounts can now load their transaction history into CoinLedger\u2019s tax reporting software in a single click. This can alleviate the hassle of gathering, transposing and combining tax reports from various accounts and/or wallets. David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, told Cointelegraph that this partnership brings full integration with MetaMask\u2019s Portfolio offering: \u201cUsers can now directly sync their portfolio with CoinLedger and then generate tax forms automatically directly from MetaMask Portfolio.\u201d In a press statement, Kemmerer added that \u201cby reducing the friction associated with calculating and reporting taxes, we\u2019re making the cryptocurrency ecosystem more accessible to everyone.\u201d The partnership comes not a moment too soon for digital asset owners/traders working within the MetaMask/CoinLedger ecosystem. With the April 15 tax reporting deadline looming for most United States taxpayers, those who\u2019ve bought, received, sold or gifted cryptocurrency and other digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens or Ordinals, are adjusting to the changing financial landscape. Expert opinions seem to vary wildly between recognizing the need for a correction to prevent crypto firms and large individual investors from overextending the margins all the way to declaring it impossible for cryptocurrency aficionados to comply with the laws as written. At the institutional level, the Biden administration is currently floating the idea of a 30% excise tax on cryptocurrency mining. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the proposal seeks to impose the tax on any firm using computer resources to mine digital assets. This would apply whether firms owned the equipment and space or leased. The tax would be implemented over three years, with the rate starting at 10%, increasing to 20% during the second year, and finally reaching the full 30% in the third year. According to Riot Platform\u2019s Pierre Rochard, the tax would apply to mining firms regardless of whether they were pulling electricity from the grid or using off-grid resources such as solar and wind power.

Bitcoin investors have vastly different impressions of the current bull market, and the latest on-chain data confirms it. Glassnode\u2019s coverage of the net position change for various BTC hodler cohorts draws a clear distinction between larger and smaller allocations. The figures were uploaded to X by popular commentator account Bitcoin Munger this week. \u201cWhat you observe in nature is much like what you observe in markets,\u201d he argued in the post.

Lo expects the Securities and Exchange Commission to put increased scrutiny on all upcoming crypto-based ETFs, especially Ether ETFs: \u201cScrutiny towards cryptocurrency ETFs has only grown, as you could argue to a certain degree that the SEC was forced to approve the Bitcoin ETFs because of its case with Grayscale. No doubt, the SEC internally views that as a huge loss for themselves.\u201d Companies vying for an Ether ETF include BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, Hashdex and Franklin Templeton.

Fidelity and BlackRock\u2019s applications must be decided by Aug. 3 and Aug. 7, respectively. In the case of a potential denial by the securities watchdog, Ethereum will survive without an Ether ETF, thanks to the rapid innovation and recent upgrades on the network, according to Lo. \u201cWhether or not there\u2019s an ETF, Ethereum will be fine.

While Bitcoin mining may no longer be a viable option for home miners due to the increasing difficulty and the soon-to-be-halved rewards for mining a block, there are several other cryptocurrencies that one can mine at home. Sources like WhatToMine can help people choose the most profitable based on their hardware. For example, a rig of six MSI GeForce RTX 3080Ti graphics processing units (GPUs) will be most profitable when mining Ravencoin (RVN) and bring around $170 per month. Zcash (ZEC) can bring in almost the same revenue while mining Clore (CLORE) can earn $158 per month. But what components does one need to mine crypto at home? Here\u2019s a list of the basic components a home crypto miner will need: Choosing the GPU is the most difficult part of building an at-home cryptocurrency mining rig, and it may require more than one day of study to choose the right one. Numerous sources can calculate combinations of GPU cards for any budget, and a miner can calculate the best option regarding equipment costs and how much income a GPU card will bring. A standard home rig requires a minimum of six GPU cards. Top cards like the Nvidia RTX4000 series cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000, which could be extremely high for a home miner. A more budget-friendly GPU for mining Zcash would be the MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Gaming X Trio 8 gigabyte (GB) for $388 per card or $2,328 for all six. The power supply ensures the stability of electricity to the mining rig. A mining rig consumes around 3\u20133.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy per month, so buying a power unit with a power reserve of 20\u201330% is better. You can take server models or connect two to three in parallel. High-efficiency power supplies are marked with 80 Plus Gold, Platinum and Titanium ratings. Recent: Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail? The Corsair HX 1200-watt 80 Plus Platinum certified power supply boasts tight voltage control, ultra-quiet operation and a fully modular cable set. It usually retails for around $171. The market offers cheaper supply models like the Thermaltake Toughpower 1500-watt 80 Plus Gold for $118. This power supply boasts a semi-modular design, a silent fan and support for up to 10 GPUs. Another feature of this power supply is the low-profile flat modular cables that allow for easy routing and improve system airflow. Miners can easily opt for a more budget-friendly option for their rig\u2019s central processing unit, as the CPU is not critical to performing mining operations. Miners could choose any inexpensive model compatible with the motherboard, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, for $361. The random-access memory (RAM) module is not required directly for mining, but it affects the rig\u2019s performance. A miner could take a simple 4 GB RAM card like the A-Tech 4GB DDR4, costing $38 for the 8 GB of RAM required to run a mining rig on Windows 10 or 11. Linux, which generally is not overloaded with \u201cunimportant\u201d software, works well with only 4 GB of RAM. In the case of the motherboard, the critical element is the number of peripheral component interconnect express, or PCIe, slots to which GPU cards can be connected. Some models have four, six, eighth or even 12 ports. The Gigabyte GA-B250-FinTech, which retails for $340, allows for the simultaneous installation of up to 12 GPU cards. The package also includes additional accessories that may come in handy like a special adapter that allows you to connect up to three power supplies at the same time \u2014 a useful functionality for mining. A cheaper option is the ASRock H110 Pro BTC+ model for $168. This motherboard was also designed specifically for mining and comes with 13 card slots and additional power connectors to keep the whole device running smoothly. The hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD) is not involved in mining cryptocurrencies but can determine the speed of the operating system. It\u2019s best to choose an SSD, as they provide faster boot-up times. A mining rig usually requires at least 120 GB. The miner can easily find an appropriate SSD, the cost of which doesn\u2019t exceed $20\u2013$30. Home miners are best built on an open frame as they can help mitigate the significant heat generation of six GPUs. Miners can find an inexpensive, used or new frame to build their rig that usually won\u2019t break the bank, costing anywhere from $20\u2013$100. As noted above, cryptocurrency mining rigs generate significant heat, and any home mining rig will need good temperature control options. For a six-GPU mining rig, miners should choose four to six fans that can cost between $100\u2013$130 in total. Of course, if the mining rig is located in a cold environment, the cooling system can be significantly cheaper, but not all home miners have this option. Choosing more budget-friendly options, the cost of a home mining rig comes in at around $3,400, which is a significant up-front cost and could take several months to recoup. Building a mining rig doesn\u2019t end with purchasing the equipment and setting up the necessary programs. Additional costs, like electricity, affect the final earnings. However, despite the significant upfront costs, there are ways that miners can optimize their rig to make it as efficient as possible. Miners can select more energy-efficient equipment to reduce energy consumption by using components with high performance-to-energy ratios and optimizing mining program settings. Some programs like Evga Precision allow miners to adjust the mining intensity, which can reduce energy consumption. Miners can also \u201cundervolt\u201d equipment, i.e., reduce the voltage to the GPU card without significant loss of performance. The most popular program for undervolting is MSI Afterburner. Another way of optimizing a mining rig is by \u201coverclocking\u201d its performance i.e., tuning the computer components to work at a higher capacity than that intended by the manufacturer. Recent: UK court rules Craig Wright not Nakamoto, ending long-standing drama This can improve mining performance but also increase the risk of overheating and potentially shortening hardware life. Miners should always monitor the hardware temperature with software like HWMonitor or MSI Afterburner to safely overclock hardware. Home miners can also overclock in small increments to test the stability of the system at each stage, as well as make improvements to the cooling system. Overall, with careful calculations and planning, home miners can still make a decent profit.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Mining, #Business, #Bitcoin Price, #Proof-of-Work, #Bitcoin Mining"},{"date":"Mar 18, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/unnamed-pre-sale-amasses-33-million-sol","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Unnamed presale address amasses $33M SOL in an hour","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"An early presale address for an unnamed, artificial intelligence (AI) focused project on Solana amassed over $33 million worth of Solana\u2019s (SOL) tokens in less than an hour.

On March 16, Binance announced it would list the Solana-based memecoin Book of Meme (BOME). The token was paired with Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), First Digital USD (FDUSD) and the Turkish lira. In addition, Binance Futures said it will also list a USDS-M BOME perpetual contract with up to 50x leverage. Ahead of the Binance listing, a crypto whale bought 314 million BOME tokens for $2.3 million on the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX) at an average price of $0.0074. After the listing, the value of the tokens pumped to a high of $0.026, making the tokens worth around $8 million. After the listing, the trade was flagged, sparking community discussions, with some alleging that this was an insider trade. On Reddit, a community member asked if they thought it was a lucky trade or an insider tip, while another floated the idea that the trader could be an insider from Binance. In a statement on X, Binance said it had launched an investigation into the insider trading allegations related to the listing of BOME on the exchange. Binance said that, during its preliminary investigation, the person at the center of the allegations had \u201cno connection with Binance.\u201d Binance also urged the community to continue to report any potential insider trading or other misconduct related to the exchange.

It uses Web3 wallets and API integrations to connect users to centralized exchanges without holding their funds. Batalin, a veteran crypto trader, noticed the lack of advanced tools in the trading space, which inspired him to experiment with testing and building them. He walked through several CeDeFiAi features, such as an aggregated balance dashboard that shows DeFi wallet balances, connected exchange accounts with their assets, and details on investments such as staking and liquidity pools. It also provides a DeFi dashboard where users can track investments across platforms such as PancakeSwap and Venus Protocol. For centralized trading, the platform integrates with various exchanges and will support features like futures and spot trading. \u201cCurrently, we have Binance and BingX exchanges integrated,\u201d Batalin elaborated. \u201cAlso 1inch, Compound, Venus Protocol, Trader Joe, QuickSwap on Polygon. We also plan to integrate Axelar core system and Axelar network for cross-chain transactions and communication.\u201d Unlike traditional Web2 models, CeDeFiAi users\u2019 funds and information are completely controlled by the seed phrases of their wallets. The platform further strengthens security with double encryption, limited access controls, and prioritizes the inherent security benefits of Web3 technology. Batalin emphasized that the team is constantly exploring additional security measures to ensure users\u2019 peace of mind. Speaking of AI, he noted that existing systems today aren\u2019t capable of fully understanding trader logic. \u201cAI algorithms are only good for finding certain types of anomalies. To improve them, you need real-time data and many data sources, which should not only be DeFi or CeFi, but also take into account social engagement, news and other information to make more accurate predictions,\u201d he said. For now, AI is being implemented in CeDeFiAi to support chat, educational assistance, basic trading strategies and calculators. The platform operates on a software-as-a-service model, which means it requires a monthly subscription fee for access. However, they offer an alternative for CeDeFiAi tokenholders: they can stake and lock their tokens for a period of time to gain free access to the platform. \u201cI think our project is essential for the industry and for mass adoption in the long run,\u201d Batalin said when speaking about CeDeFiAi\u2019s vision. \"We provide a stage for the much smaller DeFi projects.

BTC price action is struggling to reclaim old all-time highs after days of sustained selling pressure \u2014 can bulls turn the tide? A key macroeconomic week ensures that unpredictable trading conditions will continue as both crypto and risk assets await cues from the United States Federal Reserve. The battle against inflation rages on, and more recent data suggests that inflationary forces are not giving up without a fight. With BTC/USD acting within a critical zone that must be reclaimed for price discovery to continue, there is everything to play for this week. Bitcoin is now just one month away from its next block subsidy halving and could be repeating history with a classic pre-halving retracement. Cointelegraph takes a closer look at these issues and others at hand in the weekly rundown of what could impact BTC price action in the coming days and beyond. A brutal weekend for bulls hoping for a break soon placed Bitcoin at its lowest levels since March 6. Bouncing near $64,500, BTC/USD then produced a solid recovery, almost reaching the $69,000 mark before encountering fresh losses at the weekly close. At the time of writing, the pair circled $68,000, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, still unable to crack the area well known as the site of its old all-time highs from 2021. Analyzing the current setup, [popular trader Skew flagged the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart as a line to reclaim next. Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) readings on four-hour timeframes, currently at 48.2, should also return above 50. \u201cStill need a strong close above 4H 21EMA & RSI above 50 In confluence with reclaim of $69K - $70K,\u201d part of his latest post on X read. \u201cThose are the crucial confirmations for higher, till then a bit defensive.\u201d Bitcoin selling pressure was nonetheless unusually intense for a weekend with the absence of institutional trading. One theory circulating online put the trend down to a single hedge fund\u2019s position unwinding. Here, the entity may have been long BTC while simultaneously shorting the stock of tech firm MicroStrategy. When this was liquidated, the fund had no choice but to sell around $1 billion in BTC to cover the losses. \u201cAlso all week shrimp crabs and fish selling,\u201d investor Fred Krueger added in part of an explanation on X, referring to additional offloading by smaller BTC holders. Despite the setback, Bitcoin nonetheless managed its second-highest weekly close ever. At just below $68,400, the largest cryptocurrency finished the week down a mere $600 versus its previous close. \u201cNew week, with Bitcoin above the highest resistance level on the chart,\u201d popular trader Jelle wrote in an optimistic post. \u201cDon't get shaken out.\u201d Some of the latest market data captures the extent of the \u201cflush\u201d that occurred across exchanges in the wake of near two-week lows. Numbers from monitoring resource CoinGlass show days of long liquidations totaling more than $300 million. On largest global exchange Binance, perpetual swaps now have little liquidity around price, with a wall of bid support only in place at $66,266. Sellers lie in wait above $69,000. A side effect of the weekend came in the form of a reset in both open interest and funding rates, the latter still overly positive but a fraction of the recent peaks. \u201cToo much bearish sentiment on my timeline. Bitcoin is trading $5k below its ATH,\u201d James Van Straten, research and data analyst at crypto insights firm CryptoSlate, responded. \u201cEach flush out is necessary for our next leg higher.\u201d Van Straten noted that funding rates had not been negative since September 2023, and he \u201chighly doubted\u201d that those would return. \u201cWe have been and are in a bullish structure since October, so positive funding continues, with occasional resets when we get too frothy,\u201d he commented. While curiously around 'when is bitcoin halving' engulfs the curious investors, Bitcoin miners are on course to enjoy its final month of 6.25 BTC block subsidies before April\u2019s halving. The debate around how the event will impact BTC price behavior continues \u2014 a new all-time high, after all, has never preceded a halving but instead came months after it. As Cointelegraph reported, some believe that the current journey to all-time highs could be completed sooner than during other price cycles. Around the halving itself, however, Bitcoin may still stick to the classic playbook \u2014 lower, then higher. In recent content on the topic, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital spelled out the risks for hodlers going forward. \u201cIn 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun,\u201d he warned on March 17 alongside an illustrative chart. \u201cHistorically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving.\u201d In halving years gone by, this \u201cdanger zone\u201d produced corrections of up to 40% \u2014 far beyond the current maximum drawdown from recent all-time highs of around $73,700. \u201cBitcoin is slowly transitioning away from its \u2018Pre-Halving Rally\u2019 phase and into its \u2018Pre-Halving Retrace\u2019 phase,\u201d Rekt Capital added. He further noted that despite consistent buying by the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), standard cycle phenomena are still playing out. A crunch week for risk assets centers around the Fed\u2019s next decision on interest rates and accompanying commentary from Chair Jerome Powell. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will conclude on March 20 and forms a classic risk-asset volatility catalyst. That said, markets are expecting few surprises this time \u2014 persistent inflation has removed the chance of a rate cut, and even subsequent FOMC gatherings are not thought to be apt to buck the trend. The latest estimates from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool put the chances of a cut at the FOMC meeting at just 8%. \u201cIt\u2019s official: For the first time this year, markets now only see 3 interest rate cuts in 2024,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in an analysis of broader FedWatch data. \u201cThis also happens to be the first time that markets align with the latest Fed guidance.\u201d Powell will make two speaking appearances this week, with the second on March 22.

The creator behind the project mistakenly burnt over $10 million in Solana before the launch, however, despite that the memecoin was launched and reached $500 million market cap within hours. The developer raised 535,000 Solana (SOL) tokens to launch the memecoin but accidentally burnt $10.4 million worth of Solana tokens while trying to clear their wallet. The memecoin frenzy has led to comparisons with the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) era bubble of 2017 when several crypto projects raised millions of dollars but many failed to deliver. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies stemming from an internet meme or having some other humorous characteristic, but they lack any real-world use case other than being a pop culture reference. These cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and supported by some enthusiastic online communities. Dogecoin (DOGE) is considered the OG memecoin and received support from Elon Musk during the 2021 bull market. In 2024, multiple memecoins, some barely a week old, have reached billions in market capitalization, creating new crypto millionaires by the hour. The recent comparison to the ICO presale era of 2017 comes amid many influencers managing to raise millions of dollars in presales to launch new memecoins. Users on X compared the current memecoin offerings (MCOs) to the Ethereum ICO bubble in 2017 when several crypto projects promised to deliver only to vanish after raising funds. A 2018 report indicated that over 90% of ICO projects failed. Similarly, there have been several instances where influencers have run away with the presale money or have dumped it on the market right after the launch. One user on X said the memecoin mania is a more honest version of the 2017 ICO craze and the 2021 nonfungible token/crypto-art bubble, as projects \u201cno longer have to pretend to deliver on a fake white paper and investors no longer have to pretend to be in it for the art.\u201d Stories of a few traders making millions of dollars in a couple of days often attract several others to try their luck. However, on most occasions, they lose a significant chunk of their investment. Crypto proponents claim the memecoin bubble will eventually liquidate millions of new users who blindly put their money into technology with no utility.

On March 18, blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain flagged that at least 11 whales deposited their tokens to exchanges after the unlock. Collectively, the whales deposited 34 million tokens worth almost $58 million at the time of writing. The event follows a massive token unlock conducted by the layer-2 blockchain project. On March 16, Arbitrum unlocked 1.1 billion ARB tokens worth $2.32 billion. Data from crypto vesting tracker Token Unlocks showed that Arbitrum unlocked 673.5 million tokens for its advisers and its team members. It also released 438.25 million for investors. The project conducted a \u201cCliff Unlock,\u201d which means that the tokens were released all at once. This sparked predictions that many holders would take short positions against the token. Some community members even posted on social media that they sold their ARB. Some held hopes that the token would not dump. A community member hoped that it would instead follow a similar pattern to other vesting unlock periods when token prices went up instead of down. However, this wasn\u2019t the case for ARB.

The token recorded a high of $2.22 on March 13 and dropped to $1.84 on March 16, the day of the unlock. On March 17, the token dropped even further to $1.64, recording a seven-day low. Currently, the token is hovering around the $1.70 price point, almost 29% below its all-time high of $2.39, which it breached on Jan. 12. While the unlocked tokens have already driven the price down by 23.42%, holders may not yet be getting relief anytime soon. According to Token Unlocks, Arbitrum is scheduled to release another 92.65 million tokens on April 16. These tokens are worth around $157 million at current market prices and will be released all at once to the Arbitrum team, its advisers and investors.

During the review talks around a $3-billion stand-by arrangement (SBA), the IMF recommended that Pakistan\u2019s FBR impose taxes on crypto capital gains. The country has also been asked to review the taxation of real estate and listed securities, according to local news outlet The News. The adjustment in tax rates, as recommended by the IMF, aims to collect yearly taxes on capital gains on real estate assets, irrespective of whether the owner chooses to sell or retain the property. Additionally, property developers could have to comply with stricter tracking and reporting requirements, which will be supported by hefty fines for non-compliance, ultimately enforcing new tax rules in the real estate market. Local reports also suggest that the recommendations made by the IMF could become part of the upcoming bailout package under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). As a result, Pakistan\u2019s budget for the fiscal year of 2024\u20132025 could officially introduce a stringent crypto tax on capital gains. The $3 billion of IMF aid aims to stabilize the hyperinflated fiat economy of Pakistan from a debt default, which was a direct result of geopolitical tensions, natural calamities and unstable national governance, among others. Related: Pakistan banks agree on blockchain-based KYC system development The four-day IMF review began on March 14, and around $1.1 billion will be disbursed if Pakistan agrees to the conditions. The call for taxing crypto capital gains comes nearly one year after Aisha Ghaus Pasha, the minister of state for finance and revenue, said the country would never legalize crypto trading. Pakistan is betting on artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to produce 1 million AI-trained IT graduates by 2027. The policy framework showcases Pakistan\u2019s willingness to integrate AI for public and national betterment. The country has set 15 targets, with timelines ranging from 2023 to 2028.

It has been seen as a component of Cardano\u2019s roadmap under \u201cBasho\u201d \u2014 which is all about scaling. However, YouTube channel The Cryptoviser uploaded a video on March 17, claiming that Cardano had \u201cpivoted away from Hydra,\u201d based on Hoskinson announcing an integration with Hyperledger Firefly, a scaling solution that involves delivering a tech stack for enterprises to build and scale Web3 applications, on March 13. \u201cThe team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,\u201d Hoskinson wrote to his 980,000 followers on X in denying the rumors.

At the time of publication, crypto traders have sent around $100 million worth of SOL in an attempt to buy into new Solana memecoins in the last 72 hours, per aggregated data viewed by Cointelegraph and cited by crypto researcher 0xGumshoe. These tokens have been raising money for unreleased coins by way of a controversial presale model, most notably including Book of Meme (BOME), Nap (NAP), Nostalgia (NOS) and many others. \u201cThis is legit peak degeneracy.

A \u201cpre-sale\u201d involves crypto investors sending a cryptocurrency to a wallet address and then receiving a weighted distribution of tokens in return when the token goes live. There is no guarantee that an investor will receive tokens in exchange for the cryptocurrency sent to a presale wallet address, making presales an extremely popular model for frauds and scammers to steal money from unwitting investors.

Pseudonymous X user DeFiRabbitHole said when Sacks first began posting about his memecoin on X, they expected another All In memecoin to also appreciate.

On March 14, a jury in a New York District Court found David Brend and Gustavo Rodriguez guilty of one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, putting an end to a trial that lasted two weeks. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said in a March 15 press release that IcomTech founder David Carmona hired Rodriguez in mid-2018 to make a website for the newly-launched IctomTech which touted itself as a crypto mining and trading firm.

Launched on March 17, the Mehen Finance-founded stablecoin allows holders to mint or redeem USDM via the United States dollar and differs from existing Cardano-based stablecoins such as DJED and iUSD, which are algorithmic and synthetic-based. Mehen founding partner Matthew Plomin said the road to launching the stablecoin on Cardano wasn\u2019t an easy one, with delays caused by issues with U.S. banks in 2023. The firm released its white paper in November 2022, explaining a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin would provide a \u201cmuch-needed service\u201d to Cardano users. Mehen planned on launching USDM in 2023, but \u201ceverything changed\u201d when Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate and Signature Bank shuttered in March 2023, Plomin said in a March 14 X Spaces. Plomin revealed the bank it was working with, Cross River, cut ties with Mehen around when the bank teamed up with Circle, the second-largest stablecoin firm, which was looking for a new banking partner at the time. \u201cOnce they had them, they didn\u2019t care about us anymore,\u201d Plomin said, adding: \u201c[It was a] kick in the nuts delay.\u201d Mehen now uses fintech firm Plaid\u2019s services to mint and burn U.S. dollars for USDM. Plaid provides a payment transfer network between Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo and other large U.S. banks to power fintech and cryptocurrency products. The firm integrated Plaid\u2019s services in August 2023, according to an X post from Steven Fisher, chief technology officer of Mehen. \u201cAdding your bank will allow you to deposit USD to mint USDM and allow you to burn USDM to receive USD,\u201d Fisher said. Mehen is now also actively seeking a money transmitter and virtual asset service provider license to expand its services in the United Kingdom and Europe. Meanwhile, Plomin said about two dozen firms plan to integrate USDM on their platforms, which range from lending and borrowing protocols to decentralized exchanges. Mehen noted it will take one to two days for institutions to complete the onboarding process. \u201cThis means USDM will slowly be arriving on-chain the week of the 18th,\u201d it said. Issuance and management of USDM will be governed by smart contracts and decentralized oracles to ensure transparency and security, Mehen states on its website. Related: Cardano coins new name for its ADA-backed stablecoin Djed The launch of USDM was met with optimism by several members of the Cardano community, including Jaromir Tesar, who described the launch as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d for decentralized finance on Cardano. USDM enters a crowded and competitive market for stablecoins. USDT and USDC have the largest market caps at $103.1 billion and $30.8 billion, respectively, while seven other stablecoins boast a market cap of over $500 million, according to CoinGecko. However, USDM is shielded from competition from those stablecoins, at least on the Cardano network, as they aren\u2019t currently available to be transferred via the Cardano blockchain.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Altcoin, #Business, #Adoption, #Cardano, #Stablecoin"},{"date":"Mar 18, 2024","summary":"","author":"Martin Young","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/base-daily-transactions-skyrocket-after-ethereum-dencun-upgrade","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Base surges to 2M daily transactions following Dencun upgrade","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Daily transactions on the Coinbase Ethereum layer-2 network Base skyrocketed to a record 2 million on March 16, just a few days after the Dencun upgrade.

Launched by Coinbase in August, Base is the sixth-largest network in the Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem with total value locked of $1.46 billion and commanding a 4.1% market share of layer 2s, according to industry tracker L2beat. The Ethereum Dencun upgrade rolled out Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, which reduced layer-2 transaction fees by introducing data blobs or proto-danksharding. The upgrade enhanced L2 data availability, which reduced gas costs by as much as 90% for some networks. Average transaction fees on leading layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and zkSync Era fell by between 60% and 90% following the upgrade, according to Dune Analytics.

As of publication time, Bitcoin is on track to end the week down marginally by about 1% over the previous week\u2019s close. Analysts anticipate a shallow correction as they believe lower levels will attract solid buying from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund investors. Thomas Fahrer, CEO of crypto-focused reviews portal Apollo, said on X that the fall is a \u201cBear Trap.\u201d The strength in the rebound will give a better idea of whether the correction is over or not. A weak recovery indicates continued selling pressure from the bears. That increases the possibility of a deeper pullback. On the other hand, a strong bounce will indicate aggressive buying at lower levels and enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. Will Bitcoin\u2019s correction stall, starting a recovery in select altcoins? Let\u2019s look at the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. Bitcoin corrected sharply from $73,777 on March 14 and broke below the support line of the ascending channel pattern on March 16. The bulls are trying to stall the decline at the 20-day exponential moving average ($65,564), but they are likely to face resistance at the breakdown level from the channel. If the price turns down sharply from the current level, the risk of a fall increases. If the 20-day EMA gives way, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $59,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($55,303). If bulls want to prevent the downside, they will have to push the price back inside the channel. That will indicate solid buying at lower levels. A break and close above $73,777 will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then rally to $80,000. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover but the relative strength index (RSI) has risen sharply, suggesting that the selling pressure may be reducing. The 20-EMA is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-EMA, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. The pair could slide to the strong support at $64,500. If this level cracks, the pair may plunge to $59,000. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the channel\u2019s support line. The pair may then climb to $70,650 and later to $72,420. Near Protocol (NEAR) has pulled back in an uptrend, indicating profit-booking by short-term traders. A positive sign in favor of the bulls is that the NEAR/USDT pair is finding support close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.28. If the rebound is maintained, the pair is likely to retest the overhead resistance of $9.01. If this level is scaled, the uptrend may resume. The next target on the upside is $10.50. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that the traders are selling on rallies. The pair may then decline to the 20-day EMA ($6.18). This is an important support to watch out for because a break below it may start a deeper correction. The bulls are trying to sustain the price above the moving averages on the 4-hour chart, indicating solid buying at lower levels. If the price stays above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair could then retest $9.01. A break above the overhead resistance will signal the continuation of the up move. On the contrary, if the price dips below the 20-EMA, it will indicate strong selling on rallies. The pair may then drop to the strong support at $6.50. Aptos (APT) turned down sharply from $15.70 on March 16, but the bears could not sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($12.90), suggesting buying at lower levels. The rising 20-day EMA ($12.83) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the edge. If buyers drive and maintain the price above $15.70, the APT/USDT pair will signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could rise to $16.75 and thereafter to $18.69. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that every relief rally is being sold. That will point to the start of a corrective phase, which could reach the 50-day SMA ($10.73). The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, signaling a possible range-bound action in the short term. The pair may swing between $15.81 and $12 for some time. A close above the range will indicate that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That could start the next leg of the up move. Contrarily, if the price turns lower and breaks below $12.92, the pair may start a correction to $12 and then to $11.50. Related: Remilia founder claims hack after Ether, NFTs transferred Render (RNDR) corrected to the 20-day EMA ($10.02), but the bulls successfully defended the support, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls have pushed the price above the $12.78 resistance on March 17, signaling the start of the next leg of the uptrend. If buyers maintain the price above $12.78, the RNDR/USDT pair could jump to $16.81. The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the solid support at $12. The bears will then sense an opportunity to start a correction. A break and close below the 20-day EMA may accelerate selling and sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($7.09). The 4-hour chart shows that the failure of the bears to sink and maintain the price below $10 could have attracted solid buying by the bulls. The momentum picked up after the price closed above overhead resistance at $12. If the price maintains above $12, the uptrend is likely to continue. Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to drag the price back below $12. If they do that, it will signal that the break above $12.78 may have been a bull trap. The pair may then decline to $10. Maker (MKR) resumed its uptrend on March 17 after a few days of consolidation, indicating that the bulls remain in control. The MKR/USDT pair could rise to $3,580 and eventually to $4,000, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, the uptrend may continue if the bulls do not give up much ground from $4,000. The first sign of weakness will be a slide below $2,976. If that happens, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the higher levels. The pair may tumble to the 20-day EMA ($2,525), which is an important level to watch out for. A break below this support will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to sustain the pair above the ascending channel pattern. If they succeed, the pair may pick up momentum and climb toward $3,725. On the other hand, if the price fails to sustain above the channel, it will indicate a possible bull trap. The pair may then slide back into the channel. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the pair above the channel. Otherwise, a drop to the support line is likely. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It also offers data services for AI model training focusing on privacy and security. The funds will support the growth of additional Sahara ecosystem components such as Sahara Vault, Sahara ID, and Sahara Network, said the startup led by Sean Ren, a Professor at the University of Southern California, and Tyler Zhou, previous Investment Director at Binance Labs. Mirana Ventures has purchased $8 million worth of Toncoin, the native token of The Open Network (TON), a blockchain project founded by Telegram\u2019s team in 2019. The investment is part of a partnership between the TON Foundation, Bybit, and the Mantle Network. Bybit has been incorporating Toncoin into its offerings, including rewards for staking and cashback. The initiative resulted in over $22 million in trading volume, according to the TON Foundation. Meanwhile, TON Space, Telegram\u2019s self-custodial wallet, is connecting its users with Mantle Network through the integration of TON-based MNT tokens. The funds will be used to support the development of the community and projects. Telegram has over 900 million monthly active users. Web3 social platform UXLINK secured nearly $10 million in funding from a number of investors, including OKX Ventures, Web3Port Foundation, and several others, spanning across North America, Asia, and the Middle East. UXLINK is a new kind of social network platform. Unlike traditional social media that mainly focus on one-way interactions, like following someone without mutual connection, UXLINK emphasizes two-way, friendship-like connections. Some of its features include a social decentralized exchange for digital assets trading and a reward module for users participating and contributing to the platform. According to UXLINK, over 3.5 million verified users and 75,000 decentralized groups have joined the service since its launch in April 2023. Ethereum layer 2 network TEN has raised $9 million in a funding round led by banking consortium R3 with additional backing from Republic Crypto, KuCoin Labs, Big Brain Capital, DWF Labs, and Magnus Capital. The platform, developed by Obscuro Labs, combines optimistic rollups and zero knowledge rollups, offering an encrypted layer 2 for developers. The team is working on customizable privacy levels in smart contracts that will allow developers to choose which parts of a smart contract to make private and which parts to make public. TEN, currently on testnet, is set to be released on the mainnet in October, with features like programmable encryption, immediate bridges, and random number generation.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Business, #Wallet, #AI, #Layer2"},{"date":"Mar 17, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/remilia-founder-claims-hack-after-ether-nfts-transferred","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Remilia founder claims hack after Ether, NFTs transferred","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Krishna Okhandiar, the founder of Remilia and Milady, who is also known as Charlotte Fang, is reportedly claiming to have been hacked following the transfer of significant amounts of Ether (ETH) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to a wallet engaged in asset liquidation. The incident was initially highlighted by Dumpster DAO on X, who shared a screenshot of Okhandiar saying, \u201cI got drained,\u201d along with a link to an address that received assets from wallets associated with Remilia. Remilia is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the Milady Maker NFT collection. Blockchain records indicate that the address has sold numerous NFTs linked to Milady, including NFTx staked ones. It has transferred $1 million worth of Ether to another address and currently retains nearly $1 million in Ether and various other tokens at the time of publication. Although the precise method of the purported hack is unclear, blockchain security company PeckShield pointed out a prior transaction from the Remilia treasury wallet to the wallet implicated in the draining, as detailed in a post on X. Related: Mozaic Finance hacked for $2.4M via private key compromise In September 2023, Fang took to X social platform to announce that a developer in the Milady ecosystem has managed to divert about $1 million in generated fees from Remilia Corporation. According to Fang, the attacker had managed to take over three X accounts, including Miladymaker and Remilionaire, while Remiliacorp was locked out. Launched in 2021, Milady is a collection of 10,000 anime profile picture NFTs designed by Fang. In May 2023, Milady NFTs were publicly endorsed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who posted a meme using imagery from the Milady NFT collection. The move triggered a rapid spike in the floor price of a Milady NFT, which subsequently surged from 3.8 ETH to 7.8 ETH. Hacks and exploits have been a growing concern in the crypto industry, especially for decentralized finance applications. A total of $1.8 billion was lost to crypto hacks and scammers in 2023, of which 17% can be attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group, according to a Dec. 28 report by Immunefi. Within 1 individual incidents, hacking accounted for over $65 million (97.54%) of the stolen funds in February 2024.

The investigation comes amid the company\u2019s preparation for its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO). Reddit revealed the investigation in an amended Form S-1 registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024, submitted the day after receiving notice about the FTC inquiry. Reddit mentioned in the filing that it is not surprised by the FTC\u2019s interest due to the unique nature of the technologies and business agreements. However, Reddit insisted it had not engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FTC scrutiny underscores Reddit\u2019s regulatory hurdles amid the growing popularity and use of AI. While Reddit believes it hasn\u2019t violated laws, it admits the investigation might be prolonged and uncertain. Reddit\u2019s filing states: \u201cAny regulatory engagement may cause us to incur substantial costs, and it is possible for any regulatory engagement to result in reputational harm or fines, cause us to discontinue or modify our products, services, features, or functionalities, require us to change our policies or practices, divert management and other resources from our business, or otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\u201d Reddit struck a $60 million yearly agreement with Google in February, allowing the tech giant to utilize Reddit\u2019s extensive user data for AI training.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed new BTC price lows of $64,522 on Bitstamp. After hitting new all-time highs during the week, Bitcoin faced considerable sell-side pressure, with a series of lower lows accompanied by failed rebounds. On the day, offloading continued to gather speed well in advance of the hotly-anticipated weekly candle close. Analyzing the situation, popular trader Skew outlined zones of interest for bidders on major exchanges. These focused on between $60,000 and $64,000. \u201cMajority of the selling has been driven by takers (market selling),\u201d part of a post on X explained. \u201cConstant spot selling since $74K especially from coinbase & binance.\u201d Skew added that some entities were engaging in large dollar-cost averaging (DCA) at the lows, helping provide the low-timeframe bounces. Bitcoin\u2019s latest bull market correction thus totaled around 12%. As Cointelegraph reported, previous cycles saw considerably deeper pullbacks while still preserving the broader uptrend. Optimistic market observers thus remained positive, referencing the ongoing buying from the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which would resume on March 18. \u201cYes, this is Bear Trap,\u201d Thomas Fahrer, CEO of crypto-focused reviews portal Apollo, which tracks ETF flows, responded on X. \u201cWaves of liquidity are going to rain down on the Bitcoin ETFs.

During an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on March 13, Murati offered vague responses when asked about the source of data for the company\u2019s Sora model, which is capable of generating videos from text instructions. \u201cWe used publicly available data and licensed data,\u201d replied Murati about how the company valued at $80 billion was training its upcoming model. Joanna Stern from The WSJ then asked whether Sora had been trained with data from social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram or Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m actually not sure about that,\u201d Murati replied, adding: \u201cYou know, if they were publicly available \u2014 publicly available to use. But I\u2019m not sure.

But it was publicly available or licensed data,\u201d Murati added. Later, she confirmed to The WSJ that Shutterstock data was used for Sora. AI models are trained using large data sets, which help the model learn to recognize patterns, make predictions or understand language. Murati has been at OpenAI since 2018, leading some of the company\u2019s most popular projects, including the image generator model Dall-E 3, the speech-recognition tool Whisper and the latest version of the company\u2019s chatbot, ChatGPT-4. In November 2023, she briefly took over as interim CEO after OpenAI\u2019s board ousted Sam Altman. OpenAI has been targeted by several legal actions involving its AI models\u2019 training data. In July 2023, authors Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that ChatGPT generates summaries of the authors\u2019 works based on copyrighted content.

According to a Google document attached to the government sentencing memorandum filed on March 15, Bankman-Fried listed 19 \u201crandom probably bad ideas\u201d intended to change the social media narrative of the crypto exchange\u2019s dramatic downfall. The ideas included initiatives such as \u201cgo on Tucker Carlsen, come out as a republican,\u201d leaking documents to the press, criticizing lawyers and being seen as \u201cextremely pro crypto, pro freedom,\u201d along with promoting \u201ca strong anti-Binance message.\u201d The document is part of the government\u2019s argument supporting a 40\u201350-year sentence for the former FTX CEO, who was convicted in November 2023 on fraud and money laundering charges. According to the sentencing memorandum, the Google document demonstrates a \u201csignificant likelihood\u201d that Bankman-Fried would commit another fraud if released back into society at a young age. \u201cThat is not just speculation. In the days following FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, and even after the defendant had been indicted, he mused about launching \u201cArchangel LTD,\u201d which would be an alternative to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy and would result in the re-launching of an exchange.\u201d The suggested sentence is significantly lower than the maximum possible term he faces under U.S. sentencing guidelines, which could result in a 110-year sentence. In contrast, Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense counsel is seeking less than seven years in prison, according to a memo filed on Feb. 27. Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled to deliver his decision on March 28. According to the government, Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing submission already shows attempts \u201cto reframe his crimes as mere mistakes or misunderstandings\u201d \u2014 a reference to letters submitted by his defense in support of a reduced sentence. \u201cThe point is that the defendant is motivated to launch his redemption narrative and has already been thinking about how to spin it. It is realistic that he will settle on a narrative, lean into it, and convince other people to part with their money based on lies and the promise of false hope.\u201d Nearly one year after FTX\u2019s collapse, a jury trial concluded that the former executive was guilty of all seven charges brought against him by the U.S. government. Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty. FTX\u2019s new management recently disclosed plans to fully repay creditors based on the price of crypto assets at the time of bankruptcy.

The U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce made its appeal through a blog post on its website on March 15 and is leading the demand for urgent diplomatic action to address what it perceives as a significant injustice. According to the post, the detention of Gambaryan in such questionable circumstances establishes a troubling precedent, suggesting that any American entrepreneur abroad, especially those in the cryptocurrency industry, could face similar unlawful actions by foreign authorities. The blog post stated: \u201cThe unwarranted detention of Tigran Gambaryan is more than a legal issue; it is a matter of national dignity and the protection of American citizens worldwide.\u201d The Chamber of Digital Commerce believes that Gambaryan\u2019s detention is arbitrary, without due process, and presents a significant challenge to international law norms and diplomatic relations. Nigeria, a beneficiary of over $1 billion of U.S. foreign aid each year, is an ally of the United States. Initial reports about the apprehensions of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla emerged in late February, with the Financial Times covering the detentions without explicitly naming executives.

In the amendment, the SEC said the proposed changes were made to provide clarity and incorporate suggestions from industry stakeholders, \u201cparticularly with regard to the recent engagements with the CBN [Central Bank of Nigeria].\u201d The Nigerian SEC first issued rules and guidelines for all crypto and digital asset service providers in May 2022, but on Friday, March 15, 2024, it suggested an amendment to the rules.

And so it is speculative. Really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio,\u201d he stated. In 2021, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $69,000, recently surpassed when it reached $73,835. However, in 2022, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, dropping to under $16,000.

In a report published on March 12, the WEF outlined that 92% of U.S. manufacturing executives are exploring various ways of implementing the metaverse into their own firms. It cited survey results collected from 100 of the largest companies across 10 industries, indicating that, on average, each executive was investigating up to six different use cases. The WEF further highlighted that one factor driving the interest is the need for the industrial sector to \u201celevate its ambitions\u201d in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cAmid recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of technological, macroeconomic, societal and business-to-business (B2B) customer trends are accelerating and converging to create new challenges and opportunities for growth in the industrial sector.\u201d This has forced the need for manufacturing companies to find ways to speed up production cycles while also increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness through predictive forecasting. The report emphasized how different companies are using digital twin technology, utilizing virtual models to represent physical objects. Amazon has been implementing the cloud services platform Nvidia Omniverse to run simulations to improve warehouse design and robot workstations. Similarly, Mercedes Benz is also using the platform to design manufacturing assembly facilities. Meanwhile, on March 1, Cointelegraph reported that Telecoms infrastructure firm Nokia has been using the metaverse in Australia to potentially assist Cessna aircraft technicians at remote airports. Additionally, it pointed out that the industrial metaverse can be used across the product life cycle, including pre-production, production and post-production stages. In particular, tasks such as product and service design, process simulations, plant design and management, as well as product testing and quality assurance. \u201cAlthough real-life applications of the consumer metaverse are still developing, the industrial metaverse is ahead on the adoption curve, aligned with actual problems and business imperatives and driven by on-the-ground implementation.\u201d It was emphasized that the information technology and vehicle manufacturing industries are at the forefront of the industrial metaverse sector. \u201cAutomotive, energy, software and platforms, and aerospace and defense currently lead the way in industrial metaverse investment and activity,\u201d the report stated. However, some companies are hesitant to keep investing in the industrial metaverse because of the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). \u201cThis decline is in part due to the rise of generative AI; there is an assumption among many that its emergence has caused the metaverse to retreat into the background,\u201d it noted.

Bankman-Fried was not charged with illegal political contributions because the government of the Bahamas did not extradite him on that charge. Nor was he charged with bribing Chinese officials. The memorandum also stated: \u201cThe defendant has failed to take genuine responsibility for his role in the collapse of FTX and the loss of customer funds.\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentence should be subject to several enhancements due to the severity of his crimes, the document continued.

But how does the former president compare to the current one? Trump and President Joe Biden are near opposites on many issues, but cryptocurrency may be an issue where they share common ground. For his part, Biden has made few fans among cryptocurrency users and companies. However, aside from an executive order calling for research on cryptocurrency and a tweet calling out unclear \u201ctax loopholes that help wealthy crypto investors,\u201d he\u2019s personally said very little about the issue. Rather, the animosity has been spurred by Biden\u2019s administration. For example, in February 2023, headlines erupted with concerns that Operation Choke Point \u2014 an Obama administration initiative \u2014 had been revived by the Biden administration to lock cryptocurrency-related businesses and users out of the traditional financial system. As Nic Carter documented at the time, government officials were increasingly pressuring banks for any involvement with cryptocurrency. Related: Bad blockchain forensics convict the user of a Bitcoin mixer \u2014 as its operator One month later, former Biden administration advisor Daleep Singh revealed that he had worked to push for the launch of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, because it would \u201ccrowd out the ecosystem of crypto.\u201d The Biden administration then proposed in May 2023 (and again in March 2024) a 30 percent tax on cryptocurrency miners\u2019 energy costs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors argued that the proposed tax would force firms to take account of the \u201charms they impose on society.\u201d However, as many people pointed out, the tax appeared more so designed to put miners out of business than to help the environment because miners would be taxed even if they ran on renewable energy. In more recent news, the Energy Information Administration used emergency authorities to force cryptocurrency miners to comply with information requests. The agency recalled the mandatory collection, but only after it was sued and a judge issued a temporary restraining order. Finally, over the last few years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a flurry of regulations and enforcement actions. At one point, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler even went so far as to suggest that \u201ceverything other than Bitcoin\u201d could have a target on its back. As my colleagues Jennifer Schulp and Jack Solowey have described it, the SEC\u2019s approach has been illogical and unreasonable, warning, \u201cThe SEC shouldn\u2019t be left in the shadows to try to snuff out Americans\u2019 work on and access to a new class of technology.\u201d With such hostile treatment, it\u2019s easy to see why people are looking for change. But is Donald Trump really that different? Trump seems to have recognized the public\u2019s dissatisfaction and thrown out a few crumbs to appease cryptocurrency users. For example, Trump recently told CNBC he was excited to see how much of his sneaker sales were in cryptocurrency and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d want to take it away at this point.\u201d (It was revealed just last year that Trump holds approximately $2.8 million in cryptocurrency.) However, Trump is far from being a libertarian or a maximalist. \u201cYou probably have to do some regulation,\u201d Trump said when asked about Bitcoin (BTC) in February. He also added he \u201cwould not allow countries to go off the dollar,\u201d \u2014 suggesting he\u2019d use trade restrictions, regulatory restrictions, or possibly even military intervention to enforce the dollar\u2019s use. In fact, he made similar comments in 2021 when he said cryptocurrencies should be regulated heavily to prevent them from competing with the dollar. RelatedL Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility Trump was even more hostile during his presidency. \u201cI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2019. Perhaps in what would later inspire Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Trump further wrote, \u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and illegal activity.\u201d Finally, he wrote that companies looking to create cryptocurrencies should be regulated as banks. In short, Trump has effectively called for increased restrictions on currency competition, increased financial surveillance, and higher regulatory burdens. As far as policy stances go at the agency level, it was a bit more of a mixed bag (partly because cryptocurrency was still breaking into the mainstream). Under Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network introduced the infamous wallet rule to try to increase financial surveillance and rake in data on cryptocurrency users. And while it may not compare to Gensler\u2019s SEC, there were 57 cases brought against cryptocurrency-related companies under SEC chair Jay Clayton. However, at the same time, leading officials in the administration took more nuanced stances and urged caution. Mark Calabria, then-chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, said, \u201cWe are approaching this with an open mind.\u201d Acting comptroller of the currency Brian Brooks advocated for cryptocurrency and pushed for reforms. Likewise, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Acting Director Mick Mulvaney warned, \u201cIf we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences.\u201d These examples are not exhaustive, but they do provide an interesting picture of where Biden and Trump stand on cryptocurrency. Trump\u2019s record may be slightly better than Biden\u2019s on cryptocurrency issues, but neither president seems to be a \u201ccrypto champion.\u201d Rather, it seems once again the choice comes down to who is the lesser of the two evils.

The team claims that the attacker has deposited all the stolen funds to centralized crypto exchange MEXC and is \u201cconfident\u201d the funds will be returned. Mozaic Finance is a decentralized finance and yield-optimization protocol that runs on several different blockchain networks. It claims to employ artificial intelligence (AI) programs to maximize returns to investors. Blockchain security firm CertiK posted an alert on X, stating that the exploit had occurred. In an accompanying report received by Cointelegraph, CertiK claimed that the attacker drained funds by calling the \u201cbridgeViaLifi\u201d contract, which is only callable by a developer wallet. Thus \u201cthe root cause of this incident appears to be a private key compromise,\u201d CertiK concluded.

CertiK claimed that total losses added up to more than $2 million. Hacks and exploits continue to plague blockchain users. On March 9, decentralized finance protocol Unizen lost over $2 million due to an external call vulnerability. In that case, the development team pledged to immediately compensate victims. On Feb. 29, lending app Seneca Finance was exploited for over $6 million in a similar incident. In its March 15 Discord post, the Mozaic team expressed hope that the funds would be recovered through a legal process, as the proceeds of the alleged crime have been deposited into a centralized exchange.","tags":"#Ethereum, #Hackers, #Hacks, #DeFi"},{"date":"Mar 15, 2024","summary":"","author":"Derek Andersen","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/dubai-difc-passes-comprehensive-digital-asset-law-new-security-law","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Dubai\u2019s DIFC passes comprehensive digital asset law, new security law","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a special economic zone with over 5,000 residents, has announced the passage of a new digital assets law and security law and amendments to existing law. The center has its own legal system based on English law. The legislative developments seek to \u201ckeep pace with the rapid developments in international trade and financial markets [\u2026] and to provide legal certainty for investors in, and users of, Digital Assets,\u201d according to a statement. DIFC Authority chief legal officer Jacques Visser said: \u201cWe consider this legislation to be groundbreaking as the first legislative enactment to comprehensively set out the legal characteristics of digital assets as a matter of property law.\u201d The Digital Assets Law contains seven pages of text plus appendices. A law amending at least six previous laws to update them for digital assets has been passed but is not available online at the time of writing. The DIFC noted in its statement that the changes to the Law of Obligations made electronic records functionally equivalent to paper records.

The new law is modeled on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\u2019s Model Law on Secured Transactions and aligns with international best practices, the DIFC said. The DIFC updated its cryptocurrency regulations in 2022. It began subsidizing licenses for artificial intelligence and Web3 companies in 2023. The DIFC showed a net profit of $203 million in 2023, up 45% from the previous year. It also saw a 34% increase in new registrations that year. That included an increased presence of hedge funds among the newcomers, as well as an influx of businesses from Europe and the United States. While the new Digital Assets Law is claimed to the first of its kind, it is not the first jurisdiction to address the issue of crypto as property. Last year, courts in China, Singapore and Hong Kong handed down rulings on digital assets as property.

Bitwise, for instance, has been involved in \u201cserious due diligence\u201d discussions with institutions representing \u201ctrillions of dollars in assets\u201d seeking to add or increase exposure to Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months. Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer, said in a memo to investors that many individual investors, family offices, hedge funds and venture capital firms are poised to increase their stakes in spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of June. Overseas investors are also interested in investing in Bitcoin ETFs. Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly amended its rules to allow private funds to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs traded on United States exchanges. Brazil made a similar move weeks ago, enabling investors to invest in BlackRock\u2019s ETF through depositary receipts. All the Bitcoin hype, however, may not be enough to shore up Coinbase\u2019s cash flow. The exchange plans to raise $1 billion through senior convertible notes to repay previous debt issuances. Along with the buzz surrounding Bitcoin, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz explores the outlook for Ether (ETH) ETFs, Ubisoft as an XPLA validator, Coinbase\u2019s challenges and global banks taking on blockchain. A lack of communication from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) around Ether ETFs toward issuers could be a bad sign for those hoping for Ether ETF approvals by May. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there were more than a few reasons he\u2019s now downgraded the chances of Ether ETF approval to just 35%. According to the analyst, proposers are less than 70 days from the final deadline, and there has been no contact or comments from the SEC yet. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Balchunas said. In addition, Balchunas said Gary Gensler\u2019s stance on Ether could also be a factor, arguing that Gensler still views Ether as a security. Ubisoft, the maker of several hit gaming franchises \u2014 including Assassin\u2019s Creed and Far Cry \u2014 has joined the XPLA blockchain as a node validator. According to a press release from XPLA, Ubisoft will \u201cactively participate in governance proposal decisions\u201d as part of the partnership. France-based Ubisoft is among the world\u2019s largest gaming companies. Its games have sold a combined of around 800 million titles. With a market capitalization of nearly $2.75 billion, it\u2019s the second largest in Europe, behind only Poland\u2019s CD Projekt Red ($2.99 billion). Some of the most popular intellectual properties with games on the XPLA blockchain include The Walking Dead: All-Stars and Summoners War: Chronicles. Crypto exchange Coinbase plans to raise $1 billion from senior convertible notes to repay debts and for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes.\u201d The notes will only be privately offered to eligible institutional buyers and must be repaid by April 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, the firm said in a March 12 blog post. The notes are senior to common stock as holders have priority should bankruptcy or liquidation occur. Coinbase said it intends to use the proceeds to repay at maturity its own outstanding convertible senior notes due in 2026, 2028 and 2031. The three notes have respective interests of 0.50%, 3.375% and 3.625%. Major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon and Cboe Global Markets, have completed a large-scale pilot test using blockchain technology. Institutional investors executed over 350 simulated transactions via distributed ledger technology in areas such as tokenized assets, fund registry, digital cash, repo, securities lending and margin management on the Canton network, which was launched in May 2023 by startup Digital Asset Holdings. The pilot test included 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, three exchanges and the stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust.

The agreement specifies that Marathon will pay the purchase price in cash from its holdings, making the transaction final once all price adjustments are settled. Per a post on Marathon Digital\u2019s blog, the acquisition will bring the company\u2019s total Bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity to approximately 1.1 gigawatts of capacity \u2014 just shy of the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity needed to power the fictional \u201cFlux Capacitor\u201d from the Back to The Future film franchise. Fred Thiel, Marathon\u2019s chairman and CEO, commented: \u201cThis transaction increases our influence over our current operations, reduces our cost per coin by approximately 20% at the site, and provides us with an additional 100 megawatts of capacity in which to expand. [\u2026] Following the close of this transaction and the anticipated expansion of the site this year, our Bitcoin mining portfolio will consist of approximately 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which will reside on sites we directly own and operate, and all of which are diversified across eleven sites on three continents.\u201d As Cointelegraph reported recently, Marathon Digital had its best-performing revenue year in 2023, raking in $387.5 million \u2014 up 229% from the previous year and 452% for the fourth quarter. The increase in revenue was attributed to the Bitcoin rally of late 2023 and a 147% increase in Bitcoin production year-over-year for Marathon Digital. In late February, Marathon unveiled a new direct Bitcoin transaction submission service. Called \u201cSlipstream,\u201d the new service was designed and implemented to facilitate and speed up large and/or non-standard transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Next up, mining companies such as Marathon Digital will have to navigate the impending Bitcoin halving. This event, which will occur once a certain amount of blocks have been mined on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 currently, it\u2019s anticipated to occur in mid-April \u2014 could have an outsized effect on large-scale mining organizations. The rewards for mining a block will be reduced by 50% from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.

A marked slowdown in inflows could start a corrective phase as Bitcoin\u2019s most recent leg of the rally has largely been driven by solid inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs. If a correction starts in Bitcoin, how deep could that be? During previous halving cycles, Bitcoin has seen a drop close to 40%, according to a X (formerly Twitter) post by the pseudonymous trader known as Bags. If history were to repeat, then Bitcoin could plummet to about $45,500. Corrections are a part of every bull market. A positive sign during the current pullback is that it is largely due to profit-booking on hedges and has not led to \u201cpanic shorting yet,\u201d according to popular trader Skew. Could the correction in Bitcoin and altcoins deepen, or will the price rebound from the current levels? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin witnessed profit booking at $73,777 on March 14, but the bulls purchased the dip, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. However, the failure to build upon the momentum on March 15 attracted strong selling by the short-term traders. The price has reached the support line of the ascending channel pattern, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price plummets below the channel and the 20-day exponential moving average ($65,195), it will indicate the start of a corrective phase. The BTC/USDT pair could slide to $59,000 and thereafter to the 50-day simple moving average ($54,291). Contrarily, if the price bounces off the support line, it will suggest that the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time. The bulls will again try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $73,777. Ether\u2019s (ETH) up move stalled near $4,000, tempting short-term traders to book profits. The long tail on the March 14 candlestick shows the bulls tried to flip the $3,600 level into support, but the fall on March 15 shows that the bears have kept up the pressure. The bulls and the bears are likely to witness a tough battle near $3,600. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to push the ETH/USDT pair to $4,000. The bears are expected to vigorously defend this level. On the downside, the bears will try to yank the price below $3,600. If they do that, the selling could accelerate, and the ETH/USDT pair could slump to $3,200 and later to the 50-day SMA ($2,997). The greater the fall, the longer it will take for the pair to resume the uptrend. BNB (BNB) has pulled back in a strong uptrend, indicating that the traders are booking profits after a sharp rally. However, the long tail on the March 15 candlestick shows that the bulls are not ready to give up and are buying at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $527.50. A shallow pullback is a positive sign as it shows the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to enter. That increases the possibility of a break above $633. The pair may then climb to the $670 to $692 resistance zone. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $527, it will signal that every rally is being sold into. The BNB/USDT pair may then tumble to the 20-day EMA ($485). Solana (SOL) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days, indicating solid demand at higher levels. The up move has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, suggesting that the SOL/USDT pair may have run up too fast in a short time. That could start a correction, which could pull the pair to the 20-day EMA ($142). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That may enhance the prospects of a rally to $205. This optimistic view will be negated on a break below the 20-day EMA. The pair may then slump to the breakout level at $126. XRP (XRP) turned down from $0.74 on March 12, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. The bulls tried to flip $0.67 into support on March 13, but the bears had other plans. They continued their selling and pulled the price back below the $0.67 level on March 14. The selling increased further on March 15, and the XRP/USDT pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.62). This suggests that the pair may consolidate inside a large range between $0.50 and $0.74 for some time. A break and close above $0.74 will signal the start of a new uptrend toward $1.02. The bulls tried to kick Cardano (ADA) above the overhead resistance of $0.80 on March 14, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply, and the price dipped to the breakout level of $0.68 on March 15. If bears sink the price below $0.68, it will signal the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-day SMA ($0.61). Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $0.68, it will suggest that the bulls continue to buy near strong support levels. The ADA/USDT pair could then swing between $0.68 and $0.80 for a while. A break above $0.80 could launch the pair to $0.92. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose above the $0.18 resistance on March 14, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels. The price turned down sharply and reached the 20-day EMA ($0.15) on March 15. This suggests that the DOGE/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the range for a few more days. A break and close below $0.15 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could then tumble toward $0.12. Contrarily, a rally above $0.18 will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That will open the doors for a rally to $0.24 and then $0.30. Related: Bitcoin overtakes gold in investor portfolio allocation \u2014 JPMorgan Avalanche (AVAX) witnessed a large range day with a long wick and a long tail on March 14, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. The bears tried to strengthen their position on March 15, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying near the breakout level of $50. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip $50 into support. If buyers shove the price above $59, the AVAX/USDT pair could resume its uptrend to $87. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to maintain the price below the 20-day EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($40). Shiba Inu (SHIB) tumbled below the $0.000029 support on March 15, indicating that the bears are trying to establish their supremacy. The bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.000027), but the recovery is expected to face selling at the downtrend line. If the price turns lower from the downtrend line, it will increase the likelihood of a slide to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000023 and then $0.000019. Conversely, if the price turns up and breaks above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The SHIB/USDT pair could rally to the overhead resistance of $0.000039. Polkadot (DOT) turned down from $11.88 on March 14, and the selling picked up momentum on March 15. The negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum is waning. That increases the risk of a drop below the 20-day EMA ($9.93) and the breakout level of $9.59. If that happens, the DOT/USDT pair may start a deeper pullback. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($8.23). On the other hand, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to push the price to $11.88. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The 42-page report examines the state of metaverse advertising through the lens of Roblox, a metaverse gaming platform boasting over 71 million daily users as of Q4 2023. Roblox reported an annual revenue of $2,799.3 million for 2023, up 26% year-over-year. Overall, Slivingland\u2019s ad equivalency accounted for about 2.6% of Roblox\u2019s total earned media equivalency in 2023.

This downturn triggered $126 million in forced liquidations within ETH futures. Investors are now questioning whether this signals a shift away from the recent bullish trend and pondering the likelihood of revisiting the $4,090 level observed on March 12. The key to this question may lie in the demand for Ether derivatives. Ether's decline on March 15 mirrored the drops seen in Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market, showing no particular underperformance compared to the overall sector. In a similar vein, the S&P 500 index dropped by 1.1% after almost hitting a new all-time high of 5,257 on March 14. Nonetheless, this doesn't necessarily indicate a corresponding sentiment among ETH investors. Some experts believe that the movement to take profits is not unique to the crypto markets, highlighted by the U.S. 2-year Treasury yield hitting 4.73% on March 15, its peak in over three months. A rise in yield on fixed incomes suggests selling pressure, as investors seek higher returns on these assets. Therefore, whether cryptocurrencies are viewed as risky investments or scarce alternatives, traders are moving towards cash for security. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to determine the base interest rate at its next scheduled meeting on March 20. Investors are concerned that recent data on consumer inflation (CPI) and the producer price index, being slightly above expectations, might compel the Fed to maintain interest rates at 5.25% longer than initially thought. This prospect applies downward pressure on the economy and favors fixed-income investments. Thierry Wizman, a global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie, stated, \u201cI think the other issue here is not just the 2024 and 2025, its the other issues that the Fed is thinking about which includes that the market is too frothy.\u201d As per CNBC, Wizman suggested this could indicate the Fed's belief in the need for higher long-term interest rates. Despite the current volatility and uncertainty in global economies, the fact that Ether has risen 57% year-to-date in 2024 should be seen as a strong vote of confidence. However, given the typically short-term outlook of crypto investors, it is crucial to examine the ETH futures and options markets to discern if the bullish momentum has waned following the recent 10% price drop. Perpetual contracts, often referred to as inverse swaps, feature an embedded rate that is recalculated every eight hours. A positive funding rate signals a higher demand for leverage from traders holding long positions. The data shows that ETH funding rates have consistently been above 0.03% per eight-hour period, which translates to 0.6% weekly. Typically, when traders are overly optimistic about a bull market, these rates can surge above 2.1% per week. Thus, it\u2019s clear that traders engaged in perpetual futures did not shift to a bearish stance amidst the March 15 correction. To assess whether traders were taken by surprise and are now holding long positions at a loss, it's crucial to analyze the balance between call (buy) and put (sell) options. An increase in the demand for put options usually suggests that traders are preparing for neutral to bearish price movements. Over the last 10 days, the demand for Ether call options has outpaced that for protective puts by an average margin of 60%. This ratio could be considered neutral, especially since crypto traders tend to lean toward bullish positions. Therefore, there\u2019s no indication that the Ether derivatives market suffered significantly as the ETH price momentarily dropped by 10% on March 15. Based on the current state of Ether futures and options, the bull market appears to be unshaken, with indicators pointing towards continued health.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of BTC turned down from its latest all-time high of $73,835 on March 14, dropping 9% to a new weekly low of $65,565 on March 15. The drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price has also triggered a sell-off across the market, with the global crypto market cap dropping 4.1% on the day to rest at $2.59 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ether (ETH), has also dropped 5% in the last 24 hours to $3,708. Other top-cap tokens were also flashing red, with BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), Cardano\u2019s ADA (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) losing 2.3%, 7.3%, 5.8%, and 8% of their value, respectively, over the same period. Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) was the only token among the top 10 cryptocurrencies recording gains, rising 8% over the last 24 hours. Previously, Cointelegraph warned of a possible correction in the BTC price due to \u201coverheated\u201d conditions, as summarized by X user TOBTC. Data from market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock corroborates this information, highlighting growing leverage in the crypto market, which presents warning signs of a correction.

While high OI reflects new buying in the market fueled by increasing inflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), \u201coverly bullish positioning in derivatives posts a warning sign for the market\u201d when open interest grows too high, as IntoTheBlock analysts point out. The high-leverage conditions are extending beyond centralized exchanges, with loans on decentralized finance (DeFi) networks rising sharply. The chart below shows that the total debt on all DeFi protocols has doubled in 2024. According to additional data from IntoTheBlock, the total debt increased from around $2 billion at the beginning of January to reach $4.15 billion on March 14. \u201cAs Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs, crypto investors have begun seeking leverage against their holdings.\u201d IntoTheBlock also reports an uptick in the \u201caggregate amount of debt issued through Aave v3 on Ethereum,\u201d which \u201chas increased by a factor of 2.14 year-to-date.\u201d \u201cThe amount of wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) supplied to Aave has increased by more than 10,000 BTC (~$700M) so far in 2024,\u201d the report added. This means the rates in DeFi have increased with increasing \u201cdemand for leverage.\u201d As such, the firm warns the DeFi ecosystem is accumulating too much risk, which might lead to a price correction in the near term. \u201cThe crypto market is likely to experience a significant correction as leveraged positions get paid back or are liquidated.\u201d Related: Bitcoin shorts stay absent amid 'very normal' sub-$66K BTC price dip BTC price breached multiple all-time highs in March in an uptrend largely influenced by the success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States.

The news comes after the platform\u2019s token, NMT, had dramatically fallen due to a large sale, which led to speculation of a widespread exploit. NetMind is a cloud computing platform that allows graphics processing unit (GPU) owners to process data in exchange for tokens. It utilizes a blockchain network called NetMind Chain, and NMT exists on this network. There is also a version of the token on BNB Smart Chain. At approximately 1:15 pm UTC, the price of NMT nosedived from $11.34 to $2.77, a decline of nearly 76%. X users began speculating that NetMind may have suffered a mint exploit, allowing an attacker to print an unlimited number of tokens and dump them on the market, destroying the token\u2019s value. At 4:19 pm UTC, the NetMind team posted to X, denying the rumors. \u201cThe NetMind team is aware of the recent situation that has caused a mass selloff of $NMT and is actively working on mitigation,\u201d it stated. \u201cInitial indications are that this was an exploit/hack related to one of the networks early miners who mined 440k $NMT,\u201d it added,implying that the initial price drop was caused by the sale of these 440,000 tokens. The team confirmed the platform \u201chas not been compromised by any hack or malfunction.\u201d This reassurance seems to have calmed markets. At the time of publication, the token\u2019s price has regained most of what it lost, settling at $9.70, a 250% increase from the bottom. The recovery means that NMT is down only 14% from its preincident price.

The speculation was spread by Bitcoin enthusiasts on X (formerly Twitter) over the past weeks, suggesting Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund could soon add $500 billion in BTC to its portfolio. However, the probability of such capital flowing into the cryptocurrency is low, according to financial executive Shadi Qishta, as digital assets are not part of QIA\u2019s strategy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen in one way or another any time soon since the QIA has a diverse investment strategy and speeding investments across various asset classes, sectors and geographies to mitigate risk and capture opportunities in different markets and industries.\u201d QIA is a sovereign wealth fund, meaning it\u2019s a state-owned investment fund backed by the government. QIA\u2019s investment strategy must be approved by its Board and the Supreme Council for Economic Affairs and Investment (SCEAI), meaning that any revision to its portfolio allocation would go through both bodies. The speculation is also contradicted by previous statements from QIA\u2019s CEO, Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud. \u201cOur team in the technology space is exploring opportunities in the blockchain. This is the space that we\u2019re interested in, not the currency itself,\u201d he reportedly said during Qatar\u2019s Economic Forum in 2022. In addition, no word on cryptocurrencies was heard during Qatar Web Summit\u2019s opening ceremony in February. \u201cNothing was explicitly mentioned about cryptocurrency investments,\u201d noted Qishta, adding that Abu Dhabi has also announced $100 billion in technology innovation and artificial intelligence investments without including digital assets. Qatar is among the world\u2019s wealthiest nations, largely due to its vast natural gas and oil reserves. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the country\u2019s total economic output to grow by almost 2% annually until 2025. The nation\u2019s approach toward cryptocurrencies, however, remains restricted. According to Qishta, the local environment for digital assets is still characterized by cautious regulatory oversight and limited to public adoption, as crypto trading was banned in 2018. \u201cDespite the global popularity of cryptocurrencies, the adoption in Qatar is relatively low among the general public. Factors contributing to this include regulatory uncertainty, cultural norms, and a preference for traditional banking and investment methods, which are unlike what happened in Dubai,\u201d said Qishta.

The world of Web3 has been buzzing over the last few months as Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed its all-time highs (ATHs), with altcoins following not far behind. Many are reporting that this could be the beginning of the 2024 crypto bull market, something completely unfamiliar to speculators as Bitcoin has never reclaimed an ATH prior to its upcoming halving. But, while this market cycle has been different, one thing has remained the same \u2014 navigating the Web3 and DeFi ecosystem is still too complex, plagued by hacks and exploits, resulting in a user and developer experience that has left many scarred. Whether their alienation came from blind-signing their assets away to a scammer or a developer's project being exploited due to the complexity of developing in Solidity \u2014 a smart contract language \u2014 there is a solution, and it's called the Radix Tech Stack. The Radix Wallet revolutionizes DeFi transactions with its user-friendly design. Thanks to the Radix Transaction Manifest, it offers a clear preview of actions before approval. Designed with a mobile-first approach, it ensures easy and secure smart contract interactions across devices. Radix Connect enhances desktop decentralized application (DApp) usage, while Radix Personas empowers users to manage their Web3 identities securely. This wallet is at the forefront of simplifying and securing the crypto user experience. Radix Wallet has now seen over 20,000 downloads across iOS and Android and has a strong development roadmap, with new features and improvements being shipped regularly.  For Radix, it's not just about ensuring a better user experience; many of the issues with Web3 and DeFi today are spawned from a poor developer experience. Many hacks and exploits can be associated with a Web3 developer having to use coding languages that are far too complex making it easier for exploitable mistakes in the code of their DApps. To solve this issue, Radix developed Radix Engine and Scrypto. The Radix Engine, a cutting-edge alternative to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), together with Scrypto, an innovative programming language, marks a significant leap forward in the DeFi and Web3 spaces. Unlike traditional smart contract platforms, where assets are treated as secondary elements, leading to complex and unsafe interactions, Scrypto allows for asset-oriented programming. By drastically reducing the amount of code needed to build applications and making asset interaction intuitive, Radix sets a new standard for secure, efficient, and innovative DApp development, poised to catalyze a new wave of developer adoption and DApp innovation. On March 5, 2024, Radix announced #Breakout2024, releasing a video teasing partnerships, massive liquidity growth, a multimillion-dollar user onboarding campaign, a world record throughput attempt and many more plans for the year ahead. Piers Ridyard, CEO of RDX Works, gave clues to breakout DApps joining the network, institutional capital flowing through the Radix DeFi ecosystem, more tier-one exchange listings and, most importantly, a focus on trustless bridging to open up the Radix Network to capital flows from competing chains. It's all exciting stuff. The team further conveyed the importance of onboarding more liquidity to Radix with Project Ignition, which went live on March 14 and saw over $7 million of liquidity added to Radix decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in 5 hours. Project Ignition, a liquidity incentives campaign worth more than $10 million, is designed to bring more liquidity in the form of USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Ether (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) onto the network. This will ultimately improve the opportunities for participants in the Radix DeFi ecosystem and the scale at which strategies can be executed. Project Ignition also provides significant protection from impermanent loss. If a liquidity provider provides a crypto that outperforms XRD, that liquidity provider is guaranteed up to 4x protection for asset outperformance. That means Ociswap users can generate around 9% yield on your wBTC/XRD liquidity position, plus 23% in SPLASH token, and reclaim any impermanent loss in XRD tokens. Following Ignition going live, the first perpetual DEX announced its arrival to the Radix ecosystem. The Perpetual DEX called Surge is a collaboration between leading Radix DEX CaviarNine, venture capitalist firm Keyrock and Oracle service Supra. Surge will launch with 100 tradable pairs and will leverage the full Radix technology stack to provide an industry-leading, secure, seamless and streamlined trading experience alongside an intuitive yet powerful liquidity provision system.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Cryptocurrencies, #Smart Contracts, #DApps, #Software, #Developers, #DeFi, #Liquidity"},{"date":"Mar 15, 2024","summary":"","author":"Derek Andersen","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/wealth-manager-cetera-adds-spot-btc-etfs-platform-training","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Wealth manager Cetera adds spot BTC ETFs to it platform, with training","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Wealth manager Cetera has approved four spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which its managers can now offer to their clients.

The Mr. 100 whale wallet bought at least 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) on March 15, which is 52% of the total 1,907 BTC bought by the 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to an X post by HODL15Capital. This address has been continually receiving BTC since November 2022, when the FTX exchange collapsed. The wallet has been adding at least 100 BTC nearly every day since Feb. 14. The wallet received some larger Bitcoin transfers from a secondary wallet address, which has also been adding tranches of 100 BTC since 2019. This suggests that the mysterious whale has been stacking sats since at least 2019, according to HODL15Capital, who also noted in a March 15 X post: \u201cWhat I do know is that this is NOT one of the U.S. ETFs. I have all those mapped.\u201d Based on the size of the acquisitions, there\u2019s speculation that the whale could be either a Hong Kong financial institution pre-seeding for ETFs, the Qatar Investment Authority, other Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, a cold wallet associated with South Korean Upbit exchange, or an unidentified address of a tech billionaire. Mr. 100 continues accumulating regardless of Bitcoin price at near all-time highs, adding 400 BTC on March 12, when Bitcoin traded above the $72,000 mark. Following the accumulation spree, the Mr. 100 wallet is currently the 14th-largest BTC holder, according to Bitinfocharts data. The Mr. 100 wallet has been tagged as a cold wallet belonging to the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange, by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. Based on blockchain data analyzed by Crystal Intelligence, the mysterious wallet belongs to Upbit, the firm told Cointelegraph: \u201cWe have found that the number and value of transactions associated with this wallet are indicative of a VASP-type service. Additionally, we can confirm with high accuracy that the incoming transactions originate from Upbit, and these have maintained a consistent value since the collapse of FTX.\u201d Related: Is Bitcoin due for a correction with 5 weeks till the halving? Looking at the wallet\u2019s outflows, Mr. 100 has only been sending Bitcoin transactions to a wallet tagged as an Upbit hot wallet by Arkahm\u2019s platform. Most of the transactions were in tranches of at least 500 BTC, with two of the biggest transactions transferring as much as 3,000 BTC. The analytics team behind Crystal Intelligence confirmed that the secondary wallets also belong to Upbit: \u201cBitcoin is moved into three major clusters on the outgoing transaction side, and those clusters appear to be connected in subsequent transactions. We also found some evidence that the clusters that received funds from 1Ay8v belong to Upbit.\u201d Thus, the \u201cMr. 100\u201d wallet likely belongs to Upbit, argued pseudonymous on-chain analyst Defioasis, who wrote in a March 12 X response: \u201cThe regular movements of 100 BTC are not purchases but could be Upbit\u2019s unique way of managing cold and hot wallet assets.\u201d HODL15Capital also noted that a South Korean entity is stacking large amounts of Bitcoin, in a March 15 X post, referencing the heatmap from below.

The reduction is allegedly caused by a rule where only 100 Celsius corporate accounts can receive distributions through the Coinbase exchange. This rule allegedly forces some creditors to accept cash instead of crypto as payment. Since Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have risen in price significantly since the distribution was agreed upon, this leaves small business creditors with significantly reduced payments versus the top 100 business accounts on Celsius. Cointelegraph was contacted by a Celsius creditor in Australia who claims to be owed 0.182 BTC and 3.05 ETH under the terms of the bankruptcy. The creditor, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed he was told by the Celsius debtors\u2019 law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, that they would not receive the original amount. Instead, they will receive $15,741 in cash, 36% less than the cryptocurrencies\u2019 market value of $24,552 at the time of publication. By contrast, a top-100 Celsius corporate creditor will get the full amount of crypto promised, the creditor claims. The creditor provided Cointelegraph with emails between them and a Kirkland & Ellis representative. In the emails, the representative appears to confirm that the creditor will receive a cash payment that is not equivalent to the crypto promised. \u201cI understand the frustration that crypto prices have gone up since your fiat distribution was reserved,\u201d the representative stated, \u201cbut if prices had gone down, you would be [also] getting more BTC and ETH.\u201d The representative allegedly claimed that a Coinbase rule was responsible for the reduced payments, stating: \u201cUnfortunately, we only have 100 slots for corporate creditors, so those slots were allocated to corporate creditors with the largest claims. Corporate creditors not on that list of 100 have to receive fiat distributions\u2014we have no way to distribute cryptocurrency if Coinbase will not support those distributions. We have no way to make those distributions without a regulatorily compliant distribution partner.\u201d Some creditors have sent letters to United States bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who is presiding over the case, to complain about having their payments reduced. Jake and Sheri Faller of Oak Park, California stated that their payments are being reduced by 26%\u201333% because of the alleged Coinbase rule, which they considered to be unfair, stating, \u201cWe [...] feel it\u2019s unfair and not equitable that only 100 corporate accounts were selected to receive crypto distribution without any transparency on how those 100 accounts would be chosen, with the rest receiving USD checks and wires.\u201d Hong Kong resident Hui Ka Hin also complained to Judge Glenn about the decision, stating, \u201cI find myself in a precarious situation where I am forced to accept US Dollar Distribution, instead of crypto (BTH/ ETH) as mentioned in previous docket.\u201d Hin claimed that crypto distribution is allowed in Hong Kong, but for \u201cunknown reasons,\u201d Celsius chose to distribute the funds in U.S. dollars. The Celsius bankruptcy plan was confirmed by the Court on Nov. 9. It uses two different sets of crypto prices to determine the amount of money owed to creditors. The first set of prices is determined by the \u201cpetition date,\u201d or the date that Celsius filed for bankruptcy, which is July 13, 2022, while the second is the \u201ceffective date\u201d for distributions, which is Jan. 31, 2024. The petition date price for Bitcoin is $19,881, and for Ether it is $1,088.17. There are also petition date prices for other cryptocurrencies, such as Dash (DASH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pax Gold (PAXG), Uniswap (UNI) and every other altcoin that was carried by Celsius at the time it stopped processing withdrawals. To determine how much USD creditors are owed, the debtors add up the petition date value of each cryptocurrency held in the creditor\u2019s Celsius account. The result is the dollar amount owed to creditors. 14.9% of this amount is to be paid out in Ionic Digital mining company stock, 6.4% in \u201cilliquid assets recovery\u201d at a future date, and 20.8% is simply not going to be paid out due to Celsius being insolvent at the time of the petition, according to the plan. That leaves 57.9% to be paid out in cash or crypto. Most creditors are being paid in crypto rather than U.S. dollars. This is where the \u201ceffective date\u201d prices come in. The effective date price is $42,973 for BTC and $2,577 for ETH. Of the 57.9% that is to be paid out in cash or crypto, the plan calls for a 50% BTC and 50% ETH distribution to most creditors. To determine how much BTC and ETH are owed to the creditor, the debtors split the dollar amount owed into two halves. The first half is divided by the effective date Bitcoin price and the second half by the effective date Ether price, producing an amount of BTC and ETH to be distributed. Related: Celsius distributes $2B of crypto to 172K creditors For example, a Celsius creditor who held 1 BTC and 1 ETH in their account at the time the platform stopped processing withdrawals would have seen their holdings amount to $20,969.17 on the petition date. However, the creditor would only receive 57.9% of that as a cash or crypto payment, or $12,141.15. Half of this, $6,070.58, would be paid out as 0.14 BTC. The other half would be paid out as 2.36 ETH. This is an 86% decrease in BTC and a 135% increase in ETH compared to what the creditor started with. In terms of dollar value, 1 BTC and 1 ETH had a combined value of $45,550 on the effective date. This implies that our hypothetical creditor missed out on $33,408.85 in gains during the ongoing crypto bull market as bankruptcy proceedings were winding their way through the court system. If our hypothetical creditor held a corporate account that was not one of the top-100 asset holders and had not been paid as of March 13, they would have had their capital tied up even longer and missed out on even more gains. The price of Bitcoin on March 13 was $72,665, and ETH was worth $3,980.40. This means that our hypothetical investor missed out on $64,503.85 of gains or an additional $31,095 over what they would have received if they had been paid in crypto. The creditor who spoke to Cointelegraph about the issue referred to this as \u201cspecial treatment for some\u201d and claimed that creditors never agreed to this arrangement. The Kirkland representative responded by stating that the plan was agreed to by creditors and that it stipulates payments will be made in U.S. dollars if a regulation-compliant distribution partner cannot be obtained. The Coinbase exchange did not provide a comment by the time of publication. In a document filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on March 13, Celsius debtors\u2019 attorneys responded to the claims made by corporate account holders outside of the top 100. The debtors confirmed that some creditors will not receive their payments as cryptocurrency, nor will they receive the cash equivalent based on prices prevalent at the time of distribution. In the document, the debtors claim that the cryptocurrency owed to these creditors has already been sold. As a result, the debtors have purportedly not benefited from the rise in crypto prices in these individual cases and cannot pass on these benefits to creditors, as they stated: \u201c[The] Debtors sold cryptocurrency on or around January 16, 2024 to ensure that they had enough Cash on hand for Cash distributions. [...] The Post-Effective Date Debtors cannot adjust those amounts for market developments except as set forth below.\u201d If a creditor was initially scheduled to receive crypto but debtors later determined that this wasn\u2019t possible, the crypto will be sold \u201cas close as possible to the expected date of cash distribution,\u201d allowing the creditor to receive recent gains from crypto price increases. However, this practice will not occur for creditors who have been already scheduled for cash distributions. This means that corporate accounts that were not allowed to receive distributions through Coinbase will not receive the increased amount of cash, the document stated. In the document, Celsius debtors claimed that corporate accounts require a \u201csignificantly more demanding\u201d compliance and onboarding process than individual accounts. For this reason, debtors were purportedly unable to obtain a distribution partner to provide accounts to all of Celsius\u2019 corporate creditors. As a result, the debtors had no choice but to sell the cryptocurrency owed to creditors on the effective date, which caused these creditors to miss out on subsequent crypto gains, the document claimed.

On March 15, internet service provider Wifi Dabba said it would deploy more than 100,000 of its devices \u2014 all housed on its DePIN on Solana \u2014 to users across India by the end of the year to \u201cconnect the unconnected.\u201d According to Wifi Dabba, despite India\u2019s massive population of 1.43 billion people, the penetration of broadband connectivity is low. It reports only 30 million citizens have regular access to WiFi, with just under 50% having no access of any kind. This upcoming deployment will be the second time the company issues its DePIN-connected devices, already reporting a steady monthly consumption of 90\u2013100 terabytes of paid data across the already sold devices. Wifi Dabba said users who own their router hardware can earn the Wifi Dabba token as a reward for the data consumed by hotspot users. Cointelegraph spoke with the heads of Wifi Dabba to understand why India is the perfect location to deploy DePIN technology for this use case of decentralized internet. Karam Lakshman, the CEO of Wifi Dabba, said in addition to the lack of access for many Indians, the dominant major telecom companies focus on urban areas in what he called \u201ctier 1 and 2 cities.\u201d \u201cThis means it could take several decades to connect the entire country, not factoring in future spikes in data demand,\u201d he said. He also pointed out that India, as the fifth-largest economy and the second-largest holder of crypto, \u201cstands at the forefront of economic growth and technological innovation, underscoring the urgent need for faster infrastructure development.\u201d Lakshman also highlighted how the scalability of DePIN technology presents a viable solution not only for India but also for other developing nations facing similar connectivity challenges. \u201cIndia serves as a crucial test bed for refining this model, which can subsequently be replicated worldwide to address connectivity issues on a global scale.\u201d Related: Solana needs Firedancer, \u2018ChatGPT moment\u2019 to rival ETH, proponents say Shubhendu Sharma, the chief operating officer of Wifi Dabba, said that compared to the centralized model, which is dominated by a few telecom firms, the advantages of DePINs allow for accelerated infrastructure expansion through the involvement of incentivized deployers like local cable operators. \u201cAdditionally, the transparency inherent in a decentralized network enables the public availability of data, fostering a vibrant open-source community and driving the development of innovative tools and solutions.\u201d Sharma highlighted how the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the transparency of the DePIN model can potentially offer users both \u201cbetter services and accountability.\u201d Wifi Dabba\u2019s existing networks in Bangalore are said to have witnessed a \u201cwidespread usage across diverse economic strata,\u201d with use cases from taxi and delivery drivers to corporate executives. The company has also played a role in Google\u2019s local public WiFi initiatives in the country, Sharma said, as well as laser free-space optical communication internet deployments in India, which have contributed to enhancing internet accessibility nationwide. DePINs have been gaining traction in Web3 as the next big innovation to bridge the decentralized world with the mainstream. In 2023, one company tokenized 100 Tesla cars on the blockchain using DePIN technology to democratize and decentralize a ride-sharing initiative in Europe. Dawn Philip, the communications director for Wifi Dabba, said they anticipate a \u201csignificant surge\u201d in the adoption of DePINs and supporting services in 2024, particularly in developing nations. \u201cDePINs are poised to find a substantial market fit in these regions, where infrastructure development is needed the most. Unlike the developed world, where infrastructure is largely established, and market saturation is evident, the developing world presents an untapped potential for decentralized networks to flourish.\u201d Earlier in 2024, some DeFi executives echoed these sentiments with the addition of artificial intelligence, calling the pair the \u201cpower duo\u201d of 2024.

That is according to the latest BTC price analysis, which paints an optimistic picture of how BTC/USD is performing despite a 10% dip in 24 hours. Bitcoin is still following the classic road to new macro highs, longtime market participants agree. Despite increased BTC price volatility around the site of its 2021 all-time highs at $69,000, the current Bitcoin bull run remains wholly intact. This would remain the case even if a much deeper correction were to occur from current levels near $68,000, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. In comments on X on March 15, the pseudonymous trader known as Bags focused on the upcoming block subsidy halving. He drew comparisons to previous halving cycles, all of which saw major price pullbacks of nearly 40% before the event, flipping into price discovery later on. \u201cCurrently -38% off of $73.5k = $45.5K,\u201d he wrote, calculating the potential scope of downside from Bitcoin\u2019s latest all-time highs. When challenged about inflows from the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) buoying the market in a way that was absent in previous cycles, Bags noted that each previous bull market had its own catalysts, which nonetheless failed to prevent a drawdown.

This landmark event occurs approximately every four years or at every 210,000 blocks, and serves as a fundamental mechanism that cuts in half the rewards paid to Bitcoin miners. The first halving event happened in November 2012, when block rewards fell from 50 BTC per-block to 25 BTC. The upcoming halving is anticipated for some point in mid-April 2024, during which the rewards per-block will fall to 3.125 BTC. Beyond its immediate impact on Bitcoin's supply dynamics, the halving event reverberates throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, including the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). Cointelegraph spoke with a number of experts across the DeFi space, from market analysts and Bitcoin-related business executives to advocates for the currency\u2019s adoption to find out just what kind of impact they see this having on the community. At its core, the philosophy of DeFi aims to democratize access to financial services by leveraging blockchain technology to create open, permissionless, and trustless financial systems. Being the pioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin plays a pivotal role in shaping the ethos and infrastructure of DeFi. Therefore, any event affecting Bitcoin's supply and market dynamics inevitably influences the trajectory of DeFi. Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at Invest.Conotoxia.com, told Cointelegraph that not only could this halving increase Bitcoin\u2019s value, but strengthen the overall crypto market. He said: \u201cAs Bitcoin is a vital part of the DeFi ecosystem, an increase in its value could attract more investment into DeFi platforms and projects, increasing their growth and adoption.\u201d He added that, for the moment, however, Bitcoin\u2019s position is strengthening relative to the overall cryptocurrency market and is already reaching 54% of the capitalization of the market \u201cproving that capital first consolidates on the main cryptocurrency. Only later can it move to the other projects.\u201d Related: Bitcoin mining difficulty reaches new historical high as halving looms With increased Bitcoin scarcity, historically the space has seen a price appreciation for the cryptocurrency as a subsequent effect. A rising BTC price can act as a rising tide that lifts all boats, potentially leading to increased investment in DeFi protocols and applications. The reduced issuance rate of Bitcoin may also affect its availability on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms, where it often serves as collateral for a variety of financial activities. A scarcity of Bitcoin could also mean its utility as collateral could possibly increase and potentially impact borrowing rates, liquidity pools, and yield farming strategies within the DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, the Bitcoin halving schedule serves as a litmus test for the resilience and adaptability of decentralized financial protocols. As the cryptocurrency market experiences fluctuations in supply and demand dynamics, DeFi platforms must innovate and iterate to accommodate changing market conditions. Joe Hall, a Bitcoin journalist and adoption advocate, said that \u201ceither a project is decentralized or it isn\u2019t.\u201d He said: \u201cBitcoin is clearly decentralized whereas most if not all projects that claim to put the De in DeFi, are far from it. I would hope that bitcoin\u2019s anti fragile and predictable stance shows the \u2018DeFi\u2019 projects the true meaning of the word.\u201d With each halving, Bitcoin steps into the mainstream spotlight, if only for a moment, with major media outlets covering the event. This moment can not only create interest for new investors but also for regulators and developers, which could lead to anything from a push for stricter regulations on the DeFi space, but it can also inspire innovation as developers work to create DeFi solutions that comply with evolving legal frameworks. Hall said the predictability of the event, something that could work for the crypto industry, which is known to typically puzzle regulators. \u201cUncertainty has been a standout theme for the 21st century, in both finance and politics, and Bitcoin\u2019s predictability enhances its appeal.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by John Dennhy, the founder of the education project Mi Primer Bitcoin: \u201cThe halving is one of the most visible examples of Bitcoin\u2019s predictability and decentralization\u2014we all know it will happen and no single entity or group has any more power to change it than anyone else.\u201d The Bitcoin halving is not a magic bullet for the success of the cryptocurrency or the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. However, it does serve as a significant event that can play a role in shaping the future of this rapidly evolving space.

Another report from JPM Securities predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETFs market could grow as large as $220 billion in the next two to three years: \u201cWe estimate $220B of incremental flows will come into the ETFs over the next three years, which could also be quite impactful to Bitcoin\u2019s price given the multiplier on capital.\u201d Bitcoin ETFs have proven to be a net positive for the crypto market, with the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency gaining over 45% in market cap in February.

The ruling came after a protracted legal battle between Wright and the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a coalition of prominent cryptocurrency companies seeking to prevent Wright from asserting his purported ownership over the digital currency\u2019s core intellectual property (IP). COPA brought its case against Wright in 2023, alleging that he had repeatedly engaged in widespread document forgery to support his claims of being Nakamoto. As a result, they sought injunctive relief to prevent Wright from further asserting his identity as the Bitcoin creator, which could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Closing arguments in the high-profile case began on March 12 in London, with COPA\u2019s legal team presenting a scathing indictment of Wright\u2019s credibility. The alliance\u2019s legal team closed out by saying: \u201cDr. Wright has been shown to have lied on an extraordinary scale. [\u2026] He has invented an entire biographical history, producing one tranche after another of forged documents to support it.\u201d In the end, Mellor\u2019s ruling was strikingly unequivocal, noting that Wright had failed to provide any credible evidence to substantiate his claims of being Nakamoto. Moreover, he dismissed Wright\u2019s assertions and supporting documents as unreliable, effectively ending his longstanding attempts to claim ownership over Bitcoin\u2019s design IP. He closed out the proceedings by stating: \u201cDr. Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin white paper. Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system [...] he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software [either].\u201d Nakamoto\u2019s identity has been a subject of intense speculation and debate within the cryptocurrency community for over a decade. This is especially true as the digital currency revolution has garnered increasing momentum over the years, with the industry\u2019s total market capitalization nearly reaching $3 trillion in recent weeks. While numerous individuals have claimed or been linked to Nakamoto\u2019s identity over the years, Wright\u2019s assertions have been among the most persistent and controversial. Recent: Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail? Wright first publicly made the claim in 2016, backing his assertion with what he purported to be cryptographic evidence. However, the information presented was met with widespread skepticism from the cryptocurrency community, with many experts questioning the validity of his evidence and pointing to inconsistencies in his accounts. Despite the initial skepticism, Wright doubled down, presenting what he alleged to be additional evidence to support his identity as Nakamoto, including purported early Bitcoin coding samples, personal writings, and other materials that he claimed were from the early days of Bitcoin\u2019s development.

Many within the cryptocurrency community accused him of fabricating documents and engaging in a concerted effort to mislead the public about his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin. As a result of Wright continuing to make a lot of unwanted noise and thereby putting Bitcoin\u2019s future in jeopardy, the Crypto Open Patent Alliance \u2014 a coalition of prominent cryptocurrency companies including Coinbase, Block, Meta, MicroStrategy, Kraken, Paradigm, Uniswap and Worldcoin \u2014 was founded in 2020. The alliance aimed to encourage and foster the adoption and advancement of cryptocurrency-related technologies while removing any legal issues stifling the ecosystem\u2019s growth. As noted above, in 2023, COPA filed its lawsuit against Wright and his associates, seeking injunctive relief to prevent him from further claiming to be Nakamoto. During the trial, COPA presented a wealth of evidence and expert testimony challenging the validity of Wright\u2019s claims and the authenticity of the documents he had provided. Forensic analysts and cryptography experts testified that many of Wright\u2019s purported early Bitcoin materials showed signs of tampering and fabrication, casting further doubt on his assertions. In addition to his legal issues with the COPA, Wright had also previously sued 13 Bitcoin Core developers, as well as a group of companies, including Blockstream, Coinbase and Block, for alleged copyright violations related to the Bitcoin white paper, its file format and database rights to the Bitcoin blockchain. Wright\u2019s lawsuits alleged that the developers and companies had infringed on his IP by using and modifying the Bitcoin codebase without permission. However, many in the cryptocurrency community argued that Wright\u2019s claims were baseless, as the Bitcoin white paper and codebase had long been considered open-source and freely available for use and modification by anyone. Recent: Elizabeth Warren crypto bill draws criticism and sparks election challenge Moreover, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund \u2014 established to support the defendants in Wright\u2019s lawsuits \u2014 condemned his actions as \u201cfrivolous but effective\u201d attempts to deter developers from contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It argued that the lawsuits created an environment of fear and uncertainty, where developers risked being targeted with costly legal battles simply for working on an open-source system (Bitcoin). Mellor\u2019s ruling has far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry and Bitcoin\u2019s future. Dismissing Wright\u2019s claims reinforces the digital asset\u2019s decentralized nature, allowing its community to focus solely on the development and adoption of the currency without the looming threat of any more unfounded ownership claims. Moreover, the ruling also serves as a cautionary tale against fraudulent attempts to undermine the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Therefore, looking forward, the focus within the Bitcoin community is likely to shift toward exploring new use cases and fostering greater mainstream acceptance rather than dealing with more legal entanglements.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Satoshi Nakamoto, #Law, #United Kingdom, #Court, #Craig Wright, #Developers, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 15, 2024","summary":"","author":"Christopher Roark","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/pancakeswap-announces-v4-custom-pools-gas-optimization","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"PancakeSwap announces v4 with custom pools and gas optimization","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Decentralized exchange PancakeSwap released its version four codebase and white paper on March 15, according to an announcement from its team.

On March 13, the memecoin founder said their next move would be to observe and think of a strategy for creating pools with good liquidity. In November 2023, a new wave of interest hit the Solana ecosystem, increasing the token\u2019s price by 80%. This was followed by a Solana memecoin frenzy, with tokens like Bonk, Dogwifhat and Silly Dragon showing massive gains.

On March 11, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it would allow professional investors to trade crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) created by recognized investment exchanges (RIEs). Even so, restrictions that prohibit the participation of retail investors remain, making the FCA\u2019s announcement a partial victory only for broader crypto adoption. Regulatory conditions in Europe prohibit the offering of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for a single asset, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). This makes ETNs the favored exchange-traded product (ETP) in the European Union and the U.K., where financial rules are still broadly harmonized despite Brexit. With the green light from the FCA, British traditional finance and U.K. traders may shortly have easier access to crypto-tied financial products. Since the go-ahead also comes with conditions, it is perhaps unsurprising that the caveats become the focus. Natalia Latka, policy director at blockchain analytics firm Merkle Science, told Cointelegraph, \u201cThe FCA\u2019s decision to allow recognized investment exchanges to list crypto [ETNs] is a significant move forward. Despite the restrictions, this action not only fosters the integration of cryptocurrency-related products into a regulated environment but also narrows the divide between the crypto sector and the traditional financial industry.\u201d Latka also noted the exclusion of retail investors. \u201cDespite aspirations to become a crypto hub, the U.K.\u2019s approach underscores a notable hesitancy to embrace the rapidly growing interest in crypto assets among retail investors,\u201d said Latka. Cointelegraph spoke with George McDonaugh, co-founder and co-managing director of KR1, a European digital asset investment company. McDonaugh lauded the move but said the market needs to be more accessible. \u201cThe news that the FCA will not object to requests from [RIEs] to create a U.K. listed market segment for crypto asset-backed [ETNs] is a move in the right direction for the U.K. regulatory environment for crypto,\u201d McDonaugh said. McDonaugh also focused on inclusion, stating that more companies need to be enfranchised into U.K. markets. Recent: Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail? He said, \u201cWe would like more to be done around the U.K.\u2019s listing regime, allowing more companies to join the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and its junior market, for the U.K. government, other policymakers and the industry to achieve its ambition of becoming a truly global hub for the crypto industry.\u201d Whatever way you slice it, the conclusion is broadly similar; if the U.K. is serious about its nebulous crypto hub aspirations, it needs to do more to broaden participation fast. It\u2019s been some time since U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced his plan to prioritize financial technology in Britain. In July 2021, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sunak promised to \u201cimplement a sweeping set of financial services reforms\u201d over the next few years. In April 2022, Sunak said, \u201cIt\u2019s my ambition to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto asset technology.\u201d We're working to make the UK a global cryptoassets hub. We want to see the businesses of tomorrow, and the jobs they create, here in the UK. Today @JohnGlenUK set out how we are going to encourage crypto investment and technology in UK markets. https://t.co/MdZ5IOLZtH \u2014 Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) April 4, 2022 Despite these ambitions, the FCA remains incredibly cautious about the industry, and measurable advancement is hard to come by. Under these conditions, even a small positive step in the right direction feels like cause for celebration. In a statement sent to Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for CryptoUK, the U.K.-based trade association for crypto, said, \u201cWe advocated for this type of change, in line with our support for proportionate and measured regulation that is consistent and provides a level playing field for all types of innovation.\u201d \u201cWith that in mind, we will continue to advocate for a reconsideration of the existing bans on access to appropriate financial investments for retail investors,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWhilst we fully support a robust suite of investor protections, we want to highlight concerns around whether these bans are proportionate and in line with policy for similar investments that do not involve crypto assets.\u201d With the U.K.\u2019s goal of becoming a crypto asset hub, it makes sense the FCA might want to make it a special case for the industry, but only if the starting assumptions were broadly to its benefit. Instead, the opposite is true. The FCA established its ultra-cautious position toward crypto on Oct. 6, 2020. The body laid out the five reasons for its decision: According to CoinMarketCap, on Oct. 6, 2020 \u2014 the day FCA excluded retail investors from the sale of crypto-derivatives such as ETNs \u2014 the price of Bitcoin was around $10,000. Ether was valued at around $350. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was $67,139, while Ether\u2019s was $3,648. Given the upward-price trajectory for BTC and ETH over the period, Cointelegraph asked the FCA if it might be willing to reconsider its ETN ban for retail investors. A spokesperson for the FCA said, \u201cThe FCA\u2019s ban on offering cETNs [small c for crypto] or crypto derivatives to retail consumers remains in place as we continue to see significant harms in the crypto market.\u201d As to whether that might change in the near future, they added, \u201cThe FCA has previously communicated that it would continue to keep its position on cETNs under review.\u201d Naturally, industry insiders hope that the \u201cunder review\u201d status brings some meaningful change as swiftly as possible. In the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved only after significant industry, legal and political pressure. By comparison, the path to a U.K. ETN appears relatively painless, even if work is yet to be done to ensure greater accessibility. As Latka points out, \u201cGary Gensler, the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] chair, emphasized that such [ETF] approval should not be misconstrued as an official endorsement of Bitcoin. This distinction is crucial. It\u2019s plausible that the FCA in the U.K. is influenced by a concern that allowing certain crypto-referenced products could unintentionally signal that the underlying crypto assets themselves are regulated, despite their actual unregulated status.\u201d Recent: Elizabeth Warren crypto bill draws criticism and sparks election challenge But even if the FCA is motivated by the best intentions, Latka believes its stance could ultimately prove damaging to the people it is intended to protect. Latka says, \u201cThe FCA\u2019s ban might drive investors toward the shadows of unregulated exchanges, increasing their vulnerability [...] I believe that the path to safeguarding these investors should lie not in outright prohibitions but in adopting comprehensive regulations that allow safe exposure to this asset class.\u201d As CryptoUK put it, there is still a \u201cneed for further public-private sector collaboration with domestic and global policymakers.\u201d From an industry insider\u2019s perspective, FCA policy remains a work in progress.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #ETF, #Bitcoin Regulation, #UK Government, #United Kingdom, #Cryptocurrency Investment, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 15, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/hong-kong-sfc-warning-against-mexc","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Hong Kong\u2019s SFC issues warning against MEXC","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) added cryptocurrency exchange MEXC to its warning list on March 15.

Is there a way to leverage blockchain technology in pursuit of sustainability goals? Jake Campton, communications lead and community advocate at VeChain, breaks this down in episode 51 of Cointelegraph\u2019s Hashing It Out podcast with Elisha Owusu Akyaw. Campton explains how utilizing a Web3 incentive model could guide people toward a more sustainable way of life and highlights the challenges of bringing the two worlds together. Campton explains how VeChain has managed to stay relevant across multiple cycles and believes that the growth can be attributed to working on real-world use cases and focusing on securing major partnerships, such as its partnership with Walmart, which has led to over 200 million transactions. According to Campton, enterprises have a natural appetite to move to blockchain for more efficient data management, instantaneous supply chain tracking and auditing and adopting more sustainable practices. Despite the clear benefits, many enterprises are concerned about integrating blockchain technology because of hurdles like accounting and regulations. Campton says: \u201cThis is another thing that VeChain has done really well is building solutions that allow the use of blockchain in a commercial environment because, for example, companies don\u2019t want to handle crypto; they don\u2019t want to. It creates a bit of an accounting nightmare, you know, managing crypto assets and especially where the regulations have been so unclear.\u201d Campton explains how blockchain technology can contribute to a more sustainable world, a belief that has led to the launch of VeChain\u2019s VeBetterDAO. The new decentralized autonomous organization powers a decentralized application ecosystem that incentivizes sustainable activities like recycling and adopting practices that emit less carbon. Campton argues that people need incentives to adopt sustainable practices that can easily be built with blockchain technology, borrowing from various gamification models in the Web3 space. A large core developer team is actively working on porting over Ethereum toolkits to make it easier for developers who are used to building in the space to make applications for VeChain. What\u2019s more, the network has created an application that allows users with no coding language to build decentralized applications.

In a press release on March 14, the commission announced that it requests additional details from these platforms concerning their measures to address risks associated with generative AI. These include addressing \u201challucinations,\u201d viral deepfake dissemination, and automated service manipulation potentially affecting voter perception. These requests are being issued in accordance with the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU\u2019s updated e-commerce and online governance rules. The eight platforms are classified as very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the regulation mandating them to evaluate and address systemic risks, alongside adhering to other provisions outlined in the rulebook. The commission emphasizes that the questions relate to both the dissemination and the creation of generative AI content: \u201cThe Commission is also requesting information and internal documents on the risk assessments and mitigation measures linked to the impact of generative AI on electoral processes, dissemination of illegal content, protection of fundamental rights, gender-based violence, protection of minors and mental well-being.\u201d The commision, which oversees the compliance of VLOPs with the specific DSA regulations pertaining to Big Tech, has identified election security as a primary focus for enforcement. Recently, it has been soliciting input on election security regulations for VLOPs while simultaneously developing formal guidance in this area. According to the commission, the requests are intended to contribute to the development of guidance. While the platforms have until April 3 to furnish information regarding election protection \u2014 a request categorized as urgent\u2014 the European Union aims to finalize the election security guidelines by March 27. Related: First EU country adopts quantum-resistant technology The commission highlighted that the cost of generating synthetic content is decreasing significantly, intensifying the threat of deceptive deepfakes being circulated during elections. Consequently, it is increasing its focus on major platforms capable of widely disseminating political deepfakes. Under Article 74(2) of the DSA, the commission is empowered to levy fines for inaccuracies, incompleteness, or misinformation provided in response to information requests. Should VLOPs and VLOSEs fail to respond, it could result in the imposition of periodic penalty payments. The European Commission\u2019s request for information comes despite the technology industry agreement aimed at addressing deceptive AI use during elections, arising from the Munich Security Conference in February and supported by several platforms currently receiving RFIs from the commission.

Speaking at the ETH Global\u2019s Pragma London event on March 14, Buterin hailed the completion of the network upgrade, which enables L2 rollups to achieve scale by reducing the costs associated with submitting cryptographic proofs to Ethereum\u2019s base layer. \u201cWe have officially hit basic rollup scaling, but we need to keep in mind that things will be incremental from here,\u201d Buterin told a packed crowd gathered at the Christ Church Spitalfields venue. The event drew over 500 attendees ahead of a weekend-long hackathon and Buterin\u2019s attendance served as a big draw card towards the end of the day\u2019s program of speakers. Given that Dencun hit the mainnet without any hiccups, there was a palpable sense of yearning to hear what is next for Ethereum from arguably its most crucial founding member. Buterin reflected on his widely-cited roadmap for Ethereum following its successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus after The Merge in 2022. The co-founder said that many of the milestones he\u2019d laid out were primarily engineering tasks, some of which came to fruition when Dencun was finalized. Dencun included Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-4844), which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. EIP-4844 introduced a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing blob space as a replacement for using call data for storage. Using call data to store cryptographic proofs of off-chain bundled transactions has been historically expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely. Proto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after 18 days. Ethereum has been in constant flux over the past decade, and Buterin highlighted his belief that its ecosystem needs to change its approach to have a significant impact on the internet and conventional financial systems. Buterin views the first decade of Ethereum as an inwardly focused period, reflecting on how the ecosystem was developing things for itself: \u201cThe tech geeks were trying to satisfy tech geeks and create beautiful technology. The second decade needs to see Ethereum breaking out and having a big impact on the world.\u201d The Dencun hard fork has played its part in this narrative, allowing the Ethereum ecosystem to shift away from a layer 1-centric focus. Buterin also expects to see Ethereum\u2019s base layer moving away from a period of rapid change to one more focused on maintenance: \u201cWe\u2019re on the decelerating side of things. I actually think the biggest changes are behind us, which is amazing.\u201d While the Ethereum co-founder concedes that L1 changes will continue to be part of the development of the ecosystem, an L2-centric mindset should take hold going forward, focusing on application developers. Buterin said the ecosystem has created a wealth of tools to build DApps, chief among them being zero-knowledge proofs: \u201cThey\u2019re able to build applications that are much more scalable and to build applications that do a better job of preserving users\u2019 privacy. And the ease of doing that has increased massively compared to five years ago.\u201d Buterin also implored builders to adopt an \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d approach to development that makes use of contemporary tools and protocols like L2 rollups to tap into improved privacy, security and performance benefits.

By making its own chips, the San Francisco-based company hopes to reduce its reliance on Nvidia, the current global leader in semiconductor chip technology. As a part of its funding efforts, OpenAI made a deal with Thrive Capital to sell shares in the company in February 2023, which reportedly increased the valuation of the company to more than $80 billion. This marked almost a threefold increase in under 10 months. MGX, the group behind the potential UAE investment, is an AI-focused fund started earlier this week and headed by the national security adviser of the UAE Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

In September 2022, the SEC filed an emergency action to halt all operations of CryptoFX, suspecting it of being an ongoing crypto-asset Ponzi scheme. About 18 months later, on March 14, the SEC identified 17 individuals allegedly involved in the scheme.

The SEC found several individuals linked to CryptoFX misappropriated investors\u2019 funds by falsely promising investments into potentially lucrative cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). At the time, investors were lured in by the ongoing crypto bull market. The SEC requested that the court charge the individuals for violating various sections of the Securities and Exchange Act.

In a March 14 analyst note viewed by Cointelegraph, analyst Mark Palmer announced that Benchmark had initiated coverage on Bitdeer Technologies Group, issuing a buy rating on the company and setting a price target of $13. Bitdeer is a Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm spun off from Chinese parent company Bitmain, one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers. Palmer justified his buy rating by saying the Singapore-based company had differentiated itself with an average power cost of approximately $0.04 per kilowatt hour \u2014 one of the lowest costs among publicly traded mining firms. The rating was also supported by the company\u2019s expansion plans, high levels of self-mining and a recent push into the field of artificial intelligence, with its price target for 2025 doubling from its current price. \u201cBTDR shares are attractive, in our view, given the wide gap between their discount valuation and the company\u2019s growth prospects,\u201d wrote Palmer. Bitdeer shares are currently changing hands for $6.46, down 7.6% for the week and 13.8% for the month, according to Google Finance data. At the time of publication, Bitdeer is the seventh-largest crypto miner by total markevalue, with a market capitalization of $768 million. However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin mining firms, especially with the Bitcoin halving slated to occur in late-April \u2014 an event that slashes the Bitcoin-denominated rewards paid to miners in half. On Jan. 26, Cantor Fitzgerald released a report outlining that several Bitcoin mining firms may struggle to stay in profit depending on the price of Bitcoin after the halving. However, according to the graph provided by the firm, at Bitcoin\u2019s current price of $67,700, none of the firms listed in the report will be in the red.

Blockware Solutions\u2019 head analyst Mitchell Askew told Cointelegraph on March 1 that the \u201cmost logical\u201d explanation for tumbling miner share prices came from investors growing wary of buying shares in miners before the Bitcoin halving \u2014 an event that slashes the rewards paid to miners in half.

The Federal Reserve released a paper on CBDCs in Jan. 2022 as part of an effort to explore its potential benefits and risks. The central bank is also overseeing the digital dollar project which has undergone several pilot programs in recent months.

According to on-chain activity flagged by analytics firm Elliptic, hackers from Lazarus Group have transferred cryptocurrency worth $12 million to Tornado\u2019s wallets since March 13. The funds were stolen in November from the crypto exchange HTX and its cross-chain bridge HTX Eco Chain, or HECO. Hot wallets on the HTX exchange were drained for $30 million during an attack on Nov. 22, while the HECO Chain was hacked for $86.6 million on the same day. The funds were swapped to Ether (ETH) through decentralized exchanges and were dormant until this week. Tornado Cash is a decentralized and noncustodial privacy tool built on the Ethereum blockchain. The crypto mixer uses smart contracts to accept ETH and ERC-20 token deposits from one address and enables them to be withdrawn by a different address. The protocol was sanctioned in August 2022 by the U.S. Treasury Department for its alleged role in allowing the laundering of over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the Lazarus Group. \u201cTornado Cash continues to operate despite sanctions. The mixer operates through smart contracts running on decentralized blockchains, so it cannot be seized and shut down in the same way that centralized mixers such as Sinbad.io have been,\u201d explained Elliptic. The Lazarus Group has apparently switched back to Tornado Cash after losing other mixer options. According to Ellipitc, the hackers chose cross-chain bridges and the Bitcoin (BTC) mixer Sindbad to launder stolen money since the sanctions. Sindbad, however, was seized by Finnish authorities in November 2023 after U.S. sanctions went into effect, removing another mixing option for the hackers. The U.S. crackdown on crypto mixers also includes the closing of the Blender platform in May 2022. Authorities are also targeting developers of such mixers. Tornado Cash\u2019s developers, Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, have been charged with several crimes by U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The founder of the crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog was convicted of money laundering on March 12 in a similar development.

Remarkably, this movement happened amid a 4% downturn in the wider cryptocurrency market. Currently priced at $164, SOL has seen an impressive 36% increase since March 5, prompting investors to wonder whether the catalysts for a bull run toward $200 still exist. The downturn in the crypto market is partly due to a notice from Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on March 14. The notice claims that the Bybit exchange is unauthorized to offer lending and derivatives products in the area. As the second-largest derivatives exchange, Bybit has a significant $15.1 billion in open interest, as reported by CoinGlass. Additionally, the recent United States Labor Department\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which measures the average changes in prices domestic producers receive for their goods and services, influenced investor sentiment. The PPI increased by 0.6% from January to February, diminishing the likelihood of an interest rate reduction by the U.S. Federal Reserve on March 20. The introduction of reduced gas fees by Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade on March 13 may have also hindered SOL\u2019s momentum. Analysts have noted that transactions on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 decentralized exchange, are now significantly cheaper than those on Solana. For instance, on March 14, the fee for a swap on a Solana decentralized exchange (DEX) reportedly reached $0.37, while a comparable transaction on Base\u2019s DEX was $0.02. However, despite Ethereum\u2019s upgrades, there is still considerable excitement around Solana\u2019s memecoins and airdrops, such as Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk and Jupiter (JUP). A notable development for Solana\u2019s SPL tokens was when Coinbase, a leading U.S. exchange, created a webpage titled \u201cHow to Buy Jeo Boden (BODEN),\u201d directing readers to CoinMarketCap for listings. This peculiar mention was highlighted by Joe Weisenthal on March 13, and the post on the X social network has garnered over 621,300 views at the time of writing. In addition to the excitement over upcoming airdrops, this trend has led to a significant increase in the usage of Solana\u2019s decentralized applications (DApps). Recent data from the last seven days shows a 13% rise in Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) and a 24% surge in DApp volumes. On the other hand, Ethereum, the leading blockchain, saw a slight decline in TVL but an 11% rise in DApp volumes. However, in absolute TVL figures, Solana still trails behind BNB Chain and Arbitrum, which boast $3.5 billion and $2.6 billion in deposits, respectively. To gauge whether traders remain optimistic about SOL after it reached its highest price in over two years, it\u2019s crucial to examine the demand for leveraged positions in futures markets. The perpetual contract (inverse swap) includes a funding rate that aims to balance out any potential leverage demand disparity. Related: Why is Solana (SOL) price up today? A positive funding rate suggests a higher demand for leverage from long position holders, and rates above 0.10% per eight-hour period, which equates to 2.1% per week, are generally considered excessive and unsustainable. Thus, the current funding rate of 0.05% for SOL is somewhat costly for those holding long positions with leverage, but it is not unusual in bullish market conditions. Despite concerns about its centralization or stability compared with Ethereum, activity on the Solana network continues to grow. SPL tokens have certainly made a splash, securing multiple listings on leading centralized exchanges. This has encouraged investors to purchase SOL tokens to participate in the numerous ongoing airdrop programs, making a $200 target price seem achievable.

The new difficulty high was set on the same day as a new all-time-high Bitcoin (BTC) price of $73,835 amid increased investor sentiment ahead of the April Bitcoin halving. Mining difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to \u201cmine\u201d Bitcoin by solving cryptographic puzzles that increase or decrease in challenge based on the number of miners on the network. Bitcoin reached the new difficulty high of 83.95 trillion hashes, up 5.8% from the previous measurement of 79.35 trillion, on Feb. 29. It was set at a rate of 613.94 exahashes per second (EH/s), up 1.96% over last cycle\u2019s 602.14 EH/s.

The Dencun upgrade introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, which was aimed at reducing layer-2 transaction fees and enhancing data availability through blobs. Historically, Ethereum upgrades have had minimal impact on the price of ETH. In the week leading up to the Berlin upgrade in April 2021, Ether rallied 7.5%. On April 14, 2021, ETH traded around $2,043, with the price rallying approximately 3.% to $2,520 on April 15, 2021, the day of the upgrade. Before the London upgrade in August 2021, the price of the smart contract\u2019s token traded at $2,724 on Aug. 4, rising by 3.4% to $2,821 on Aug. 5 when the upgrade went live. ETH then rose again 30% to $ 3,191 by the end of that week. The Grey Glacier upgrade, which took place on June 30, 2022, saw the price drop by 3.8% from $1,098 to $1,057. During that week, ETH experienced a price decrease from $1,275 to $1,043. In the week leading up to \u201cthe Merge,\u201d the hard fork that saw Ethereum transition from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake algorithm, ETH rose by 20%. On the day of the Merge, on Sept. 15, 2022, Ether fell sharply from a high of $1,635 to close the day at $1,472. The price continued declining steadily during that whole week to close at $1,325, representing a 25% weekly drop. This week, as Dencun is implemented, ETH is trending lower, and if more headwinds add to the selling pressure, like the diminishing hope of a spot Ethereum ETF, its price could sink deeper.

On Feb. 1, Cointelegraph reported that Bybit was seeking a virtual asset trading operator (VATP) license in Hong Kong through its Spark Fintech Limited subsidiary. Only two crypto exchanges in Hong Kong are licensed by the SFC, including the OSL exchange, which received a license on Dec. 15, 2020, and HashKey Exchange, which was licensed on Nov. 9, 2022. The deadline for crypto exchanges operating in Hong Kong to file for a VATP application lapsed on Feb. 29. Unlicensed firms must cease operations in the special administrative region by May 31. Likewise, exchanges whose VATP applications are rejected by the SFC must also leave the city within three months.

The audit was performed by Trail of Bits, which claimed to have found no Orb software vulnerabilities that \"that can be directly exploited in relation to the Project Goals as described,\u201d the report stated. The full Trail of Bits report is expected to be published on March 14, according to an emailed statement from Worldcoin. Worldcoin allows people to verify their humanity by registering with a phone number or email address or by having their iris scanned by an Orb device. When a user performs this registration, they obtain a \u201cWorld ID\u201d that can be used to prove they are an actual human. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Altman claimed that he helped to create Worldcoin out of fear that artificial intelligence (AI) bots may soon be able to pose as humans effectively. Privacy advocates have criticized Worldcoin on the grounds that it risks leaking users\u2019 iris scans to hackers or governments. These iris scans could potentially be used to reveal all of the activity a person performs with their World ID. Related: Spanish court denies Worldcoin\u2019s injunction request against regulator According to the report from Worldcoin, Trail of Bits began its assessment on Aug. 14, 2023. The security firm was given version 3.1.10, which was \u201cfrozen\u201d for assessment purposes on July 8, 2023. The current version is 4.0.34, the report stated. The auditors reportedly spent six weeks investigating the code for any potential vulnerabilities. They considered several attack vectors that a hacker could use to obtain a user\u2019s iris scan but ultimately concluded that \u201cour analysis did not uncover vulnerabilities in the Orb\u2019s code that can be directly exploited in relation to the Project Goals as described.\u201d Specifically, the auditors concluded that an attacker could not obtain the user\u2019s iris code unless the attacker has control of one of the trusted certificates. They reportedly stated: \u201cWe believe the iris code is not written to persistent storage on the Orb and that it is included only in a single request to the Orb\u2019s back end [...] [W]hile this configuration can be improved to make it more secure (TOB-ORB-10), it should not be possible for typical attackers to extract the iris code from the Orb\u2019s network traffic; the attacker would have to be in control of one of the trusted certificates.\u201d According to the report, the auditors did make two recommendations to improve the Orb\u2019s security. The first was to \u201charden\u201d the configuration for the signup flow to ensure that future changes do not introduce security issues. The Worldcoin team implemented this first recommendation. The second was to fix a bug in the ZBar library used to scan QR codes during signup. The auditors claimed that ZBar had \u201cmemory safety\u201d issues that could leak configuration data, such as the user\u2019s \u201cdata custody choice,\u201d if this change was not made. The Worldcoin team responded to this second recommendation by replacing the ZBar library with a pure Rust version. The debate over Worldcoin\u2019s privacy practices may continue for some time. On March 6, Spain\u2019s Agency for the Protection of Data issued an injunction against the project, claiming that the agency needed time to investigate claims that Worldcoin violated data protection laws. In response, Worldcoin claimed that it did not violate these laws and that the Spanish government was \u201ccircumventing EU law\u201d by issuing the injunction.

In February, a coalition of military and national security professionals cooperating with the Blockchain Association raised concerns about Warren\u2019s proposed crypto legislation. The senator\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering bill has industry figures troubled, believing it could hinder the pace of blockchain\u2019s development in the U.S. if passed. In a letter titled \u201cEnacting Proposed Legislation that Threatens Digital Asset Development,\u201d 80 signatories expressed their opinion that Warren\u2019s bill \u201crisks our nation\u2019s strategic advantage, threatens tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, and bears little effect on the illicit actors it targets.\u201d Cointelegraph spoke to Kristen Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, to find out what has happened since its February intervention. \u201cThe letter we sent to Congress on Feb. 13, signed by former military and national security experts, has garnered strong support from both industry leaders and key allies in Congress,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s broad consensus on the importance of implementing effective policies to maintain America\u2019s leadership in emerging technology. The industry remains committed to advocating for responsible regulation, aiming to cultivate an environment that encourages innovation and advances our nation\u2019s strategic objectives.\u201d Unperturbed, Warren continues to advocate anti-crypto policies. In a Feb. 27 Bloomberg interview, the senator claimed she wished to work with the industry while simultaneously smearing it. \u201cI want to collaborate with the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why the industry seems to be saying that they only way that they can survive is if there\u2019s plenty of space for the drug traffickers and the human traffickers \u2014 oh, and the terrorist, and the ransomware scammer and the consumer scammers.\u201d Warren went on to raise the specter of nuclear weapons and rogue nations. \u201cNorth Korea is financing about half of its nuclear missile program with crypto,\u201d she said. Warren\u2019s tendency to pile the crypto industry in with the lowest dregs of society and villainy has won her few friends in the blockchain space. Danny Lim, a core contributor at decentralized exchange MarginX, said that Warren\u2019s bill is a prime example of a wasted endeavor. \u201cThe Elizabeth Warren crypto bill embodies a legislative effort expending a 1,000% effort to achieve a 1% outcome,\u201d says Lim. Recent: Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail? According to Lim, Warren\u2019s key mistake is believing regulations intended for the traditional finance world can be lifted and applied to crypto wholesale. As Lim explains, \u201capplying traditional banking methods for monitoring and tracing may prove ineffective.\u201d \u201cInstead, we should explore more crypto-centric solutions for a meaningful convergence of TradFi and DeFi [decentralized finance]. Implementing generic travel rules and mandatory KYC [Know Your Customer] for on-chain transactions does not sit well with crypto users and the industry as a whole,\u201d said Lim. Zac Cheah, co-founder and CEO of Pundi X, a blockchain-based point-of-sale solution, echoes Lim\u2019s assessment. \u201cSimply applying traditional banking regulations to digital assets without adjustments could hinder innovation. To sustain the crypto industry\u2019s growth, it\u2019s vital to push for regulations that tackle money laundering effectively while also being flexible to accommodate digital assets\u2019 unique traits,\u201d Cheah told Cointelegraph. \u201cWe need a regulatory approach that fosters innovation while protecting the financial system from illicit activities,\u201d he concluded. Until recently, Warren\u2019s attacks on blockchain had few real consequences. That may be set to change. On Feb. 20, Lawyer and XRP (XRP) advocate John Deaton announced his intention to stand for Senate in Warren\u2019s state of Massachusetts. Deaton\u2019s move for the Senate seat means Warren now faces a direct threat to her power from within the crypto industry. Prominent members of the cryptocurrency community, like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, have already contributed to his campaign. I just donated the maximum amount allowed for @DeatonforSenate in his fight against Elizabeth Warren for Senate. We need people willing to take on the establishment against banks writing our laws and destroying the Crypto industry. pic.twitter.com/tTxmghBhUH \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) March 3, 2024 As for Deaton, he cuts a somewhat unlikely political figure. The lawyer is known in the crypto community for advocating for XRP holders, representing their interests against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Deaton practices law in New England. His links to the Bay State come from his time studying law in Boston. Deaton is now renting a property in Massachusetts and has put his Rhode Island residence up for sale. Whether Deaton can unseat Warren or not, it makes a potential headache for the incumbent. His campaign website states, \u201cJohn Deaton is a U.S. Marine veteran, cancer survivor, father to three daughters, trial attorney, author and someone who overcame impossible odds to build a life for his family and become a champion for other underdogs.\u201d A February poll of Boston.com readers suggests Warren may have a challenge on her hands. Of the over 500 respondents, 57% said Warren was vulnerable to Deaton, while 39% said she was too entrenched. Recent: Will the Bitcoin halving bring more institutional investors into crypto? Deaton\u2019s campaign for the Senate seat also marks another milestone in the arrival of crypto as a political force. As Blockchain Association\u2019s Smith told Cointelegraph, \u201cWe are pleased to see an increasing number of pro-crypto candidates enter the electoral races at various levels of government.\u201d That\u2019s food for thought for anyone standing on an anti-crypto platform.","tags":"#Washington, #Law, #Politics, #Government, #Congress, #Adoption, #US Government, #Elections, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 14, 2024","summary":"","author":"Stephen Katte","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/crypto-startups-failure-business-markets","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Moon or doom: Why do so many crypto startups fail?","type":"Blog","category":"Analysis","content":"Creating a successful startup is challenging at the best of times, especially in the crypto industry, where an estimated 95% of startups fail. There have been thousands of crypto startups as the industry has developed. According to the business platform Crunchbase, at least 2,619 are operating in various stages of development as of 2024. There has also been a fair share of cryptocurrencies, with over 24,000 listed on CoinGecko since 2014, but at least 14,039 have died since then. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Robert Hoogendoorn, the head of content at blockchain analytics platform DappRadar, said the reasons for failure with crypto startups can be multifold, ranging from a lack of funding and investments to poor product market fit, wrong marketing or a technically flawed product. However, one of the fundamental reasons he says crypto startups can fail is that building a successful startup is tough regardless of the industry. According to Exploding Topics, up to 90% of startups fail across almost all industries. In the first year, the average failure rate is around 10%, rising significantly from there. \u201cNow translate this general market data to crypto, and the challenges get a lot bigger; the crypto market is highly volatile, and we just came out of the longest crypto winter,\u201d Hoogendoorn said. \u201cThere are various teams in Web3 building great products, and some of them survived one or even two bear markets. However, there are also organizations that had poor financial management or simply not enough money and had to close their doors,\u201d he added. Bear markets can also prove fatal for crypto startups. The latest bear market and crypto winter began in 2022. Five others have preceded it, lasting between five months and two years. In these cycles, Hoogendoorn says, \u201cinvestors tend to be less risky,\u201d which makes it harder for businesses to find funding and stay afloat. In addition, Hoogendoorn thinks, \u201cfinding product market fit in Web3 isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \u201cProduct development, marketing, cash flow; these things all need to be reinvented to make it in Web3.\u201d \u201cOn top of this comes the speed of innovation; Web3 developments happen so fast the competition launches a better product than you do within weeks. This is exactly what makes Web3 exciting but also very challenging for startups and founders,\u201d he added. At the same time, despite the high failure rate, Hoogendoorn thinks the future looks bright for some crypto startups, thanks to an increase in the \u201camount of talent moving into this industry,\u201d resulting in better products, better user experiences and easier onboarding. Related: VC Roundup: Are VCs returning to crypto? February suggests renewed confidence Hoogendoorn predicts that while the high attrition rate for crypto startups will likely claim more businesses in the long run, the natural life cycle will see some rise to the top as tech juggernauts. \u201cAs the industry grows, many more startups will have to close their doors, but some will grow and become the PayPal, Uber or Doordash of Web3, offering innovative products that help consumers reach their goals through smooth interfaces and easy user experiences,\u201d he said. Crypto markets are well-known for their volatility, where large price swings help investors create or lose fortunes in a lightning-fast fashion. According to James Hallam, head of business development at dYdX Foundation \u2014 an independent decentralized finance (DeFi) nonprofit \u2014 volatility and rampant speculation frequently lead to startups built on unsustainable hype rather than solid business fundamentals. \u201cMost importantly, the success of crypto startups is critically dependent on the team\u2019s ability to execute their vision,\u201d he said. \u201cMany crypto startups falter due to a lack of clear direction, failing to pivot or adapt in a rapidly changing environment.\u201d From the late 1990s until the early 2000s, internet-based companies were the subject of massive hype and investment as well. The sector peaked at a value of $2.95 trillion before slumping to $1.195 trillion as capital dried up and investors left in droves, causing many companies in the industry to go bust. Related: Ethena Labs secures $14M in funding for synthetic dollar According to Hallam, these lessons can provide crucial data for crypto startups to weather the harsh winters and bear markets. \u201cIf teams can understand the lessons of history and prioritize achieving product-market fit over succumbing to the allure of hype, this will pave the way for more resilient and innovative ventures in the crypto industry,\u201d he said. \u201cCrypto startups should draw on the historical experiences of Web2 companies, which faced the formidable challenge of launching innovative technologies while attempting to achieve product market fit,\u201d Hallam added. Fraser Edwards, the co-founder and CEO of decentralized data infrastructure provider cheqd, believes that aside from the already mentioned reasons for crypto startup failures, the crypto market is still in an \u201cexperimental phase\u201d as people figure out what works, often through trial and error. Edwards told Cointelegraph that other factors that could cause crypto startup failures include a lack of focus on solving real problems and neglecting revenue building. \u201cThere is still a big focus on building cool tech but without ever thinking if it\u2019s solving a real problem. Often, the tech gets built before any market validation has been done,\u201d he said. \u201cMany projects believe that marketing is having a nice logo and a set of influencers to \u2018shill\u2019 their token; there\u2019s no real strategy on basic activities such as SEO, content production or effective PR.\u201d Related: Where crypto can grow: Digital asset regulations around the world According to Edwards, a lack of clarity around crypto regulations, especially in the United States, can lead to uncertainty in the market as well, preventing customers and end-clients from adopting the tech, which in turn makes the startups go bust. Since Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2008 white paper went public, the legal status of the crypto industry has been the subject of debate, legal action and no small amount of angst from governments. A Dec. 19, 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers report found that 42 countries discussed or passed crypto regulations and legislation in 2023. However, many still lack a clear regulatory framework. At the same time, Edwards thinks some of the failed crypto startups may very well have been created to fail, with rugpulls and other scams contributing to the \u201csignificant turnover\u201d in crypto startups. Rug pulls occur when a startup solicits capital from investors only to cease operations and vanish, absconding with the funds. Often, rug pulls in crypto involve selling a token, which ultimately becomes worthless after the business shuts down. A lack of differentiation can also contribute to failures because there is a \u201chuge amount of innovation, especially at the network layers.\u201d \u201cThis means you have entire ecosystems being built upon protocols which are then superseded by better tech,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cRelated to this, a lot of companies and offerings are not differentiated beyond the protocol they are built upon,\u201d he added. Overall, Edwards says one of the biggest challenges facing crypto startups is that they often lack people with experience in the business world and the ability to create successful products. Related: Biotech, AI and climate tech are booming sectors for startups \u2014 Web Summit Qatar \u201cAlthough this has been improving every year, there are still a lot of projects that ignore business values and etiquette such as having a mission and vision, planning for long-term token and network utility, being punctual and setting commercial objectives,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cA big factor that feeds into all the above is that crypto is still a young industry, and it is not unusual to find people who have never worked in other industries. This means they haven\u2019t had a focus on revenue and sustainability drilled into them.\u201d","tags":"#Business, #Bitcoin Price, #Technology, #Tech, #Startups, #Fintech, #tech startups"},{"date":"Mar 14, 2024","summary":"","author":"Savannah Fortis","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/data-privacy-security-concerns-half-tech-industry","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Data privacy and security concerns worry nearly half of tech industry consumers: Report","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Consumers in the tech industry have concerns, and data privacy and security are among the biggest, especially in the cryptocurrency industry, according to a report from the Aleo Network Foundation.

While most people were focusing on the promised transaction fee reduction for layer-2 scaling networks, the most significant benefit of the upgrade is actually fee stabilization, Nick Dodson, the co-founder and CEO of Fuel Labs, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview: \u201cOn the point of EIP-4844, a lot of people talk about the fee reduction, but it\u2019s more about fee stabilization. It\u2019s actually more about expanding capacity and scale and not so much lowering fees.\u201d Some Ethereum L2s saw a 99% median transaction fee reduction after the upgrade went live, including Starknet, Optimism, Base and Zora OP mainnet. The Dencun upgrade\u2019s fee reduction for L2s is a huge bonus for the industry, but the main benefit is related to the network\u2019s mass scalability and stabilizing the current fees for the next millions of new users, according to Dodson. He added that this increased network capacity will further lower layer-2 fees with future upgrades: \u201cAs we add more data blob capacity now, the dynamics will shift, and not only will it be more capacity, but it will be probably a lot cheaper in terms of data availability.\u201d The Dencun hard fork incorporated nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).

This includes diving deeper into key areas from the first phase, where an e-HKD could provide value. This includes programmability, tokenization and atomic settlement. Furthermore, the HKMA said it will also attempt to look into new use cases that were not covered in the previous phase. The central bank urged market participants to apply, giving them until May 17 to submit their applications. The HKMA estimates that the second phase of the e-HKD pilot will last until mid-2025 to give the participants enough time to test and evaluate the use cases they are proposing. The financial regulator also provided guidelines to those who want to participate in the pilot. According to the HKMA, applications will be assessed based on their innovative elements or uniqueness from existing market offerings, impact on consumer experience, readiness for market testing, compliance with existing regulations and how it maximizes e-HKD use in Hong Kong.

Dyor, a decentralized crypto exchange, wants to get a role in this change by driving financial interactions with a commitment to community-driven growth. Following the collapse of FTX, formerly the third largest crypto exchange, investor interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and noncustodial finance began to increase. Supporting this trend, a report highlighted that 40% of crypto trading platforms have started using decentralized technology and that retail demand is higher than institutions. Despite the rising popularity of noncustodial alternatives, the transition to Web3 and DeFi comes with a learning curve, as noncustodial platforms lack user-friendly tools for investment. Addressing adoption challenges, some initiatives are trying to position noncustodial platforms as a compelling alternative to traditional finance by improving access and usability. Dyor, a decentralized investment platform, provides a simple, transparent and noncustodial alternative for investors turning to DeFi from the chaos of traditional crypto exchanges. Opening its doors to experienced investors and newcomers to the crypto space, Dyor intends to become an accessible hub for online investing. Available on both iOS and Android, Dyor integrates features designed to enhance the user's investing experience, such as wallet swaps, bridging, asset management and tracking.  Dyor's decentralized investment app supports more than 30 fiat currencies. Source: Dyor Dyor offers access to multiple chains, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain and other Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible infrastructures in a single wallet. The platform offers lower fees than its onchain and centralized exchange competitors, with 30% of the platform fees returning to users who stake its native token, DYOR. In the DeFi ecosystem, community engagement is not just beneficial \u2014 it's foundational. Dyor embraces a community-centric approach, allowing users to create profiles to share trades, token purchases, market opinions and crypto-related insights through their \"All Things Crypto\" feed. In addition to user-generated content, the feed aggregates news from 129 sources, providing a market view. Dyor is exploring integrations with platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and other social media channels to further enhance its news aggregation capabilities. Dyor is a social investment platform where community engagement and capital meet. Through the Dyor app, investors have the opportunity to connect, drawing on mutual experiences for more advantageous deals. Users can access the follow-trading feature, where they can imitate the actions of experienced investors, and the social investing model, where investments are made in line with a specific goal. With minimal steps, users are able to discover new tokens and benefit from Dyor's live price alerts, access to market news and ease of integration. The app sends notifications about market movements and lets users manage their assets, send tokens and calculate their portfolio\u2019s profit and loss (P&L).  Users can follow other investors and learn from them. Source: Dyor Through the platform's native token, users can unlock premium features, advanced analytics and discounted exchange fees. Engaging with other participants, taking part in events, participating in competitions and completing milestones awards users the platform's native token. Users can also receive token rebates from the trading volume generated by the users they bring into the platform. Markuss Jonans, CEO of Dyor, emphasized the importance they attach to simplicity and social interaction. Underlining their priority on exploration, he added: \u201cWe aspire to be the app where users navigate the intricate landscape of allocating their capital on-chain, identify which tokens to acquire and discern the narratives that captivate and stand out the most.\u201d Jonans underscored that they initially estimated the number of users would be less than 100,000 and said that the waiting list on their website has already collected over 450,000 registrations. The interest beyond expectations shows the potential of noncustodial alternatives to traditional finance solutions. Reflecting on the advancements and community-driven approach of platforms like Dyor, it's evident that user-friendly, secure and inclusive financial platforms will continue to shape the future of investing. As these platforms become more accessible and their benefits more widely recognized, investment and financial services paradigms will be redefined on a global scale.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Investments, #Cryptocurrency Exchange, #Applications, #DeFi, #Web3, #Cointelegraph Accelerator"},{"date":"Mar 14, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-halving-not-priced-in-full-extent","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin halving not priced in to \u2018full extent\u2019 \u2014 D8X founder","type":"Blog","category":"Interview","content":"There are approximately 34 days until the Bitcoin halving will reduce the Bitcoin (BTC) issuance rate by half.

On March 14, BNB Chain announced its rollup-as-a-service (RaaS) solution to help projects build layer-2 networks on BNB Chain. The service will give projects access to the tech infrastructure required to deploy layer-2 networks on the blockchain, expanding BNB Chain\u2019s ecosystem. BNB Chain also explained that the service supports decentralized applications (DApps). This allows a wide range of project verticals, including blockchain gaming or decentralized finance, to be deployed on the layer-2 networks. In addition, BNB Chain is also providing rollup management support and a \u201cno-code\u201d deployment option for projects that might not be familiar with coding. The BNB Chain team explained that the layer-2 networks established through BNB Chain\u2019s RaaS service will be built on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which they described as their \u201cfoundational layer-1 blockchain and governance chain.\u201d According to the BNB Chain core development team, the new service follows its goal of supporting the mass adoption of Web3 technology.

Dencun is a scalability-focused upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet, with many touting it as one of the most significant upgrades since the Merge. Starknet, a prominent Ethereum-based L2, has seen a 99% reduction in gas fees since the upgrade. The protocol shared a screenshot of its latest gas fee, which has come down to $0.04 compared to over $6 prior to the Dencun upgrade. Several other L2 platforms, including Optimism, Base and Zora OP mainnet, registered a dramatic decline in gas fees after the Dencun upgrade. The average transaction fees for Optimism dropped to $0.05, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. Within 24 hours of the upgrade, Optimism and chains based on Optimism\u2019s tech stack, like Base, have seen the most critical gas fee reductions. One of the most widely used L2 platforms, Arbitrum One, plans to launch its ArbOS upgrade to introduce blob support to Arbitrum rollup chains later today. The Dencun hard fork introduced nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-484 introducing data blobs and providing L2s with a new transaction data type called blobs. The latest data blobs bypass the traditional \u201ccall data\u201d process to publish information on the Ethereum mainnet, providing faster transactions at lower fees.

As the number of rollups using blobs rises and the battle for blob space is predicted to heat up, the low cost of L2 chains using blobs may see increased fees in the future, resulting in higher transaction costs.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Altcoin, #Ethereum, #Layer2, #zk-STARK, #Dencun Upgrade"},{"date":"Mar 14, 2024","summary":"","author":"Amaka Nwaokocha","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/eu-draft-rules-stablecoin-complaint-procedures","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"EU publishes draft rules for stablecoin issuer complaint procedures","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The European Union (EU) financial regulators want to add more stablecoin regulation guidelines under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework by publishing draft regulatory standards for issuers of stablecoins when dealing with complaints.

Related: EU banking authority extends Anti-Money Laundering guidance to crypto The MiCA regulatory framework within the bloc categorizes stablecoins that can be linked to multiple fiat currencies or other assets, including cryptocurrencies, as ARTs. This is distinct from stablecoins solely pegged to the value of a single currency, like the euro or dollar. Prior to this, the EU had been actively monitoring stablecoins through the MiCA regulation. The push for stablecoin oversight became imperative after the collapse of Terra\u2019s UST, which raised concerns about their systemic implications. Independently, the EBA had previously suggested regulations for stablecoin issuers. Another provision within the MiCA legislation also mandates rigorous screening of shareholders and board members for crypto asset service providers (CASPs). These rules seek to authorize CASPs while ensuring the separation of customer assets and trading. The goal is to avoid the comingling of customer and company money, as in the case of FTX. The full implementation of MiCA is anticipated by December, while the stablecoin regulation is slated for launch in the summer. The MiCA legislation seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for crypto issuers, service providers and users.

The metric primarily deals with recording economic transactions between residents and non-residents. Andorra \u2014 a country best known for its ski resorts and tax-haven status \u2014 required technical assistance on 56 topics, one of which was its inability to record cryptocurrency transactions.

At the same time, the IMF warned against the use of unbacked cryptocurrencies as national currency. However, the IMF said that developing a regional approach to digital money would help mitigate problems such as scalability restraints and economic volatility. \u201cSome PICs are more prone to currency substitution by crypto assets and stablecoins due to weak confidence in their domestic monetary systems and the absence of other publicly supported digital assets such as CBDCs [central bank digital currencies].\u201d In general, the report leaned toward slow, deliberate action on digital currency while urging the island nations to hold off on their plans to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), citing its unpreparedness.

The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office filed a civil forfeiture action on March 13 aimed at returning $2.3 million in a variety of cryptocurrencies, including USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Ether (ETH) and Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL), to the victims of online scams and fraud. A civil forfeiture action is a legal process through which law enforcement agencies seize assets, such as property or funds, that they suspect are involved in illegal activity. In these cases, the assets are considered the defendant in the legal proceedings rather than any person. The cryptocurrencies, which include nearly 300,000 USDC, 1.5 million USDT, 102,000 Tron (TRX), 3,000 SOL and 14,000 Cardano (ADA), were seized from two Binance accounts in January following an investigation last spring into a \u201cpig butchering\u201d scam targeting a Massachusetts resident. Pig butchering is a technique in which scammers establish trust online and get the victim to invest in a crypto scheme before the victim realizes they have been defrauded. Regulators in the U.S. have warned investors of the technique and have brought charges against some bad actors. Authorities initiated an inquiry into the scheme in the spring of 2023 and disclosed that cryptocurrency had been confiscated from funds connected to 37 victims, including the individual from Massachusetts.

The United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s action closely follows last week\u2019s news that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago had seized $1.4 million in USDT from an unhosted virtual cryptocurrency wallet tied to a suspected tech support scam targeting the elderly. Tether cooperated willingly in the asset recovery process, destroying the funds linked to the accused fraudsters and reallocating them to alternative wallets under government supervision for restitution to the victims. In January, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued warnings and charged digital asset platform Debiex with fraud for allegedly using pig butchering to take $2.3 million from investors. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also warned investors when it issued a pig butchering alert late last year.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Cryptocurrencies, #Government, #United States, #Scams, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 14, 2024","summary":"","author":"Jesse Coghlan","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/judge-strikes-motion-dismiss-genesis-gemini-sec-suit","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"SEC suit against Gemini, Genesis lives on as court finds claims plausible","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s allegation that crypto firms Gemini and Genesis sold unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program is plausible enough to continue in court, a federal judge has ruled.

The judge also denied a separate bid asking the court to stop the SEC\u2019s request ordering them to stop selling securities and for the pair to hand over Gemini Earn profits if the SEC wins the suit. Judge Ramos said the SEC\u2019s January 2023 suit \u201cplausibly alleges\u201d that Gemini Earn \u2014 a crypto yield-bearing product that was offered by Gemini and managed by Genesis \u2014 offered and sold unregistered securities, adding that the SEC sufficiently alleged Gemini Earn met the requirements of an investment contract under the Howey test \u2014 a legal framework to classify securities.

The SEC\u2019s allegations that Gemini Earn agreements were notes also stood, according to the order. Notes are a debt security obligating loan repayments with interest. \u201cAt this stage, under both tests, the court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program.\u201d However, the order doesn\u2019t mean the judge will rule in favor of the SEC \u2014 the regulator still has to prove its case, and all sides will now go ahead with gathering evidence.

Dogecoin (DOGE) was the first and largest memecoin by market capitalization, it noted and added DOGE spawned the creation of many more memecoins. DOGE, which has long been touted by Tesla boss Elon Musk, is the tenth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $26 billion.

In a March 14 order, Justice Brigitte Markovic ruled that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) \u201chas not established that the Finder Earn product is a debenture\u201d under the Corporations Act \u2014 a debt security where companies promise to pay back borrowed money with interest. \u201cAs each of the contraventions of the Corporations Act alleged by ASIC is predicated on establishing that the Finder Earn product is a debenture, those contraventions cannot be made out. Thus the proceeding should be dismissed with costs,\u201d Justice Markovic ruled. In December 2022, ASIC sued Finder subsidiary Finder Wallet alleging its Finder Earn product was an unlicensed financial product and required the exchange to hold a financial services license. Finder \u201csunset\u201d the product a month earlier, which ASIC claimed was due to it notifying Finder Wallet of its concerns, but a spokesperson told Cointelegraph at the time that it was \u201ca strategic business decision\u201d due to increased interest rates and \u201cnot brought on by regulatory review.\u201d A Finder spokesperson told Cointelegraph the order was \u201cdefinitely a landmark win.\u201d Asked whether Finder would consider relaunching the Earn product, the spokesperson said there were no plans at this time, reiterating that the decision to close the product was due to rising interest rates at the time, rather than any regulatory action. In a March 14 blog post, Finder Global CEO and co-founder Frank Restuccia stated the firm is \u201cdelighted with this outcome, which confirms that Finder was compliant with our regulatory obligations.\u201d \u201cWe understand and respect the importance of good regulation to protect consumers and we engaged openly and proactively with ASIC from the outset,\u201d Restuccia added. In a March 14 statement, ASIC executive director of enforcement and compliance Tim Mullaly said the regulator pursued the matter as it \u201cconsidered that this product was being offered without the appropriate license or authorization and therefore without the benefit of important consumer protections.\u201d The statement adds ASIC will \u201cconsider the judgment carefully.\u201d noting it has 28 days to lodge an appeal bid to the Full Federal Court, which comprises three judges.

Schiff has acknowledged that gold may be losing some of its market share to the spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, he believes investors may have trouble cashing out the funds when Bitcoin experiences a major fall. Gold was priced at $1130 (per oz) at the start of 2010 and has increased 91.8% to $2,168 since then. However, it has been largely outperformed by many index funds, such as State Street\u2019s Standard & Poors 500 ETF (SPY) which has increased 350% over that timeframe.

Uploading the Bee Movie script is a long-running joke in and outside crypto circles, which usually involves a race to mint the full-length script on brand-new networks and blockchain-related functions. The trend originates from a larger Bee Movie meme which involves posting the full-length script wherever possible across social media. Blobscan data shows that the script was uploaded at 2:08 pm UTC on March 13, just 13 minutes after the Dencun upgrade went live. The transaction cost a total of $13.88, according to data from Etherscan. Also referred to as EIP-4844 or \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d blobs were introduced as a core feature of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade in a bid to reduce transaction costs on layer-2 networks by a significant margin. Alongside several other improvements, the Dencun upgrade allows for layer 2s to use blobs instead of a calldata function for temporarily storing data while executing transactions, resulting in cheaper end costs for users. Cline\u2019s Bee Movie script will only exist on the Ethereum network for another few weeks, as Blobs are \u201cpruned\u201d after approximately 18 days \u2014 the amount of time required for a layer 2 to retrieve the data contained within.

At the time of publication, three Ethereum layer-2 networks \u2014 Starknet, ZkSync, Optimism and Base \u2014 have implemented blobs on their networks, per Dune Analytics data. In a March 14 post to X, Base lead developer Jesse Pollak announced that the integration of blobs on the Base network had seen transaction fees fall from around $0.31 to near-zero. Related: Industry veterans share praise, skepticism, as Ethereum Dencun upgrade goes live Over 2,000 blobs have been posted on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain, with Starknet accounting for 74% of all blobs submitted since the Dencun upgrade was rolled out on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13. Outside of EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade incorporates another eight EIPs designed to improve a wide array of functions on the network, including consensus, execution, and data costs. This includes EIP-1153, which introduces a \u201ctransient storage\u201d system to further reduce fees, as well as EIP-4788, which increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract that can be queried by applications. Developers expect the data provided by EIP-4788 to be used in new features for bridges and staking pools. The reduction in fees on swaps and transactions on Ethereum layer 2s will only kick in once the networks begin integrating EIP-4844 on the networks.

This week\u2019s \u201cThe Week Onchain\u201d report by market intelligence Glassnode notes that Bitcoin\u2019s recent clearance of the $69,000 all-time high set in November 2021 created the \u201cfourth new cycle ATH in history.\u201d Analyst Checkmate cites BTC\u2019s significant rally above $72,000, which has shifted this phase of Bitcoin bull run \u201cinto the 'Euphoria Zone\u2019\u201d \u2014 a stage \u201cwhich tends to accompany new ATHs.\u201d This is reinforced by data from Alternative, which shows that the \u201csentiments and emotions\u201d in the market are in the \u2018extreme\u2019 greed zone\u2019 at 81. In the \u2018extreme greed\u2019 zone, just like with the \u2018euphoria phase,\u2019 investors \u201ctend to get greedy when the market is rising, which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out)\u201d as speculators enter the market. Glassnode notes that \u201cthis moment has historically triggered a distinct shift in investor behavior patterns, particularly in the relative balance between HODLers and the Speculator cohorts.\u201d The on-chain analytics firm also observed a \u201cclassic\u201d characteristic of Bitcoin bull markets where wealth is transferred from \u201cold to young\u201d investors. The chart below shows that \u201cinvestors who accumulated BTC at cheaper prices several months to years in the past\u201d have accelerated their distribution pressure as Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. \u201cThis wealth transfer is once again in play, with the proportion of wealth held by 'Young coins' (moved within the last 3 months), increasing by 138% since October 2023.\u201d Glassnode says this underscores \u201ca net expenditure by longer-term investors who had previously held their coins for at least 3 months.\u201d This information is corroborated by more data from Glassnode, which shows that the number of new Bitcoin wallets increased by 54% from 308,743 to 475,005 over a span of one month. This increase mirrored BTC\u2019s 58% gains over the same period. Glassnode analysts report an increase in short-term supply holders by \u201c+810k BTC\u201d since November 2023, and they believe it comes from two sources: \u201c660k BTC transferred from long-term Holders\u201d and \u201c150k BTC withdrawn from exchange balances we monitor.\u201d Related: Will the Bitcoin halving bring more institutional investors into crypto?

Likewise, integrations by traditional retail payments players \u2014 Visa and Mastercard \u2014 could push the crypto market to dramatically higher valuations in the year ahead. Despite explosive growth, crypto's daily active users still pale in comparison to mainstream apps like TikTok. To truly achieve mass adoption and retention, the ecosystem needs high-utility use cases that drive frequent engagement. Payments show promise but are served by strong traditional players and remain heavily regulated. However, complementary cryptocurrencies for loyalty rewards hold untapped potential. Related: Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility There are promising local announcements, such as the Polygon blockchain\u2019s loyalty program \u201cStarbucks Odyssey\u201d in the United States; Flipkart\u2019s \u201cFiredrops\u201d in India; and Kai-Ching loyalty points by the Kaikai AI shopping app in China, facilitated by a partnership with NEAR Protocol (NEAR). However, only global payment networks \u2014 that is, major credit cards \u2014 can foster a truly global approach to retail crypto rewards. While novel, even radical financial models emerge, adoption requires meeting consumers where they are. So how can crypto blend into deeply ingrained retail habits? While crypto debit and credit cards have gained popularity among digital currency enthusiasts, these products have shown limited effectiveness at bringing mainstream consumers into the crypto ecosystem. Currently, card holder demographics are heavily skewed towards existing community members, missing vast potential for broader adoption. Even with perks like earning up to 5% of cryptocurrency on spending and discounts at major apps like Spotify, Airbnb and free access to business lounge areas at airports, the average user sees too many barriers preventing the leap to unknown territories of digital assets. Large players like Crypto.com have invested heavily in user acquisition, but have not managed to expand far beyond crypto's core community, as their offerings grow increasingly unappealing even for early adopters. Driving transactions alone clearly falls short of converting casual observers into participants. However, loyalty mechanics are a universally recognized concept for the majority already earning incentives on regular purchases. Perks and discounts at grocery stores, coffee shops, gas stations are an intuitive drawing card. If thoughtfully designed, such familiar Web2 tools could seamlessly blend with the novel world of Web3 through embedded crypto rewards, payments and experiences that lower the learning curve. The hardest part in realizing the potential of crypto incentives on everyday purchases is overcoming the fragmented loyalty ecosystem \u2014 vast networks of partnerships, point integrations, legacy infrastructure. This poses barriers for agile startups aiming to disrupt retail rewards. However, recent announcements by established networks Visa and Mastercard demonstrate a vision for another path. Rather than outdated players to compete with, they could be ideal partners to drive the next wave of crypto mass adoption. Visa has established itself as one of the most crypto-forward major payments companies. It was an early player enabling crypto debit and prepaid cards allowing spending from digital wallets. The firm is actively developing blockchain capabilities like its Universal Payment Channel for business transactions. Visa has also filed numerous metaverse, nonfungible token (NFT) and cryptocurrency trademarks, anticipating Web3 will dominate digital commerce. In a recent partnership with SmartMedia Technologies, Visa announced a new \u201cVisa Web3 Loyalty Engagement Solution\u201d that allows merchants to create crypto-powered digital engagement campaigns including NFT tickets, loyalty coins and augmented reality scavenger hunts. SmartMedia has Web3 marketing campaigns in their portfolio, but neither has used Visa transactions data for them yet. It will be fascinating to see which brands are first to trial this new offering this year. Mastercard favors a controlled, incremental utilization of cryptocurrencies. The company shows receptiveness toward government-backed central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins tied to fiat. In 2021 Mastercard launched the Bahamas Sand Dollar in partnership with The Central Bank of the Bahamas and Island Pay \u2014 and reaffirmed its receptiveness to digital forms of centralized bank-issued currencies in its 2023 policy priorities. This cautious strategy focuses on readiness and compliance over direct innovation. As a result, Mastercard views loyalty programs as a way to refresh outdated systems by integrating digital assets when ready. To ensure utilizing these features, the company teams up with \u201cend-to-end\u201d solutions which are already familiar to an ordinary consumer. In partnership with my own mobile payments app, Swoo, Mastercard ran a pilot that offered crypto-backed cash back on credit card spending in January 2024. The key goal of the campaign was to promote mobile contactless payments in Eastern Europe, while using crypto rewards as an effective engaging incentive to users. More than 17,000 users earned crypto rewards for the first time simply by shopping as normal \u2014 and they increased card spending by 56%, a win-win-win model that could scale globally. Loyalty can be a win-win-win solution for users, traditional payments players and the industry to overcome major crypto adoption obstacles. Some of the top challenges include: Despite these challenges, loyalty programs act as complementary incentive layers above regulated payments. Visa and Mastercard\u2019s weight will lend legitimacy to crypto amid regulatory uncertainty. Likewise, incentives emphasize utility over complexity. Integrating crypto with credit cards will enhance user experience. Related: Bad blockchain forensics convict the user of a Bitcoin mixer \u2014 as its operator Partnerships with trusted financial brands also improve reputation. As pivotal players, Visa and Mastercard's support signals crypto rewards are going mainstream. This drives confidence. Cash still dominates global commerce. Surveys from November 2023 showed more than 65% of point-of-sale purchases in some emerging countries were still being conducted using paper money. By embracing crypto-powered loyalty programs, legacy payments giants like Visa and Mastercard gain a global tool to attract the unbanked and underbanked while combatting stagnant cash usage. Blending tokenized rewards into routine spending provides the perfect conduit to not only engage existing cardholders, but also onboard the billions of consumers who remain on the sidelines of digital payments. In previous bull runs, most attention and capital were allocated to capital-markets tools, protocols and memes. Those cater to a small group of professionals. Now technology is mature enough to improve everyday lives on a mass scale. Partnerships with traditional industry giants could be one of the fastest and most sustainable means to that end.

One of the main reasons for Bitcoin\u2019s sustained rally is the solid demand for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Data shows a new record of more than $1 billion in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs on March 12. The insatiable appetite for Bitcoin ETFs far exceeds the newly mined Bitcoin supply in 2024. Compared to about 65,500 Bitcoin mined in 2024, the two largest Bitcoin ETFs have gobbled up more than 330,000 Bitcoin. A strong demand is likely to limit the downside in the near term. Bernstein analysts anticipate Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by mid-2025. However, nothing goes up in a straight line. Every bull market has its share of corrections. Sentiment can change quickly if a pullback starts. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 100% of Bitcoin holders are in profit. That may cause a sell-off if Bitcoin breaks below crucial near-term support. Could Bitcoin start a correction from the current levels, resulting in a pullback in select altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. The bears tried to start a pullback at $73,000, but the long tail on Bitcoin\u2019s March 12 candlestick shows solid buying on intraday dips. The BTC/USDT pair has been rising in the upper half of an ascending channel pattern for several days, but the bears have not allowed the price to rise above the resistance line. However, if bulls shove the price above the channel, the bullish momentum could pick up, and the pair may pole vault to $80,000. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $70,000, the pair may drop to the channel\u2019s support line. The selling could accelerate if the bears sink the price below the channel. The pair may fall to $59,000 and subsequently to the 50-day simple moving average ($53,099). The bears pulled Ether (ETH) below the psychological level of $4,000 on March 12, but the long tail on the day\u2019s candlestick shows that every dip is being viewed as a buying opportunity. The buyers are trying to drive the price above the immediate resistance of $4,100. If they can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The pair could ascend to $4,372 and eventually to $4,868. A minor risk to the continuation of the rally is that the RSI has been trading in the overbought zone for the past several days. That suggests the rally is overheated, and a minor correction or consolidation is possible. The critical support to watch on the downside is $3,600. BNB (BNB) picked up momentum after breaking above $460 and has been cruising higher since then. This suggests a strong demand at higher levels. There is a minor resistance at $617, but if the buyers do not cede ground to the bears, it will suggest that traders are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the uptrend to continue. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to $670. Vertical rallies are rarely sustainable and are generally followed by sharp falls. The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the psychological level of $500. That may accelerate selling, pulling the pair down to $460. Solana (SOL) has been grinding higher in the past few days. The long tail on the March 11 and 12 candlestick shows that the bulls are buying on intraday dips. If the price sustains above $153, the SOL/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally toward $184. The rising 20-day EMA ($133) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that buyers remain in control. The important support to watch out for on the downside is the breakout level of $126 and then the 50-day SMA ($113). A break below this support zone will signal the bears are back in the driver\u2019s seat. XRP (XRP) rallied sharply on March 11 and reached the overhead resistance of $0.74, but the bulls could not overcome the obstacle. The bears tried to pull the price back below $0.67, but the bulls held their ground. This is a positive sign as it shows the buyers are trying to flip the $0.67 level into support. If they do that, the XRP/USDT pair could skyrocket above $0.74. The pair may then start an uptrend toward $0.85 and later $1.02. On the contrary, if the price continues lower and breaks below $0.67, it will indicate that the bulls have given up. The pair may decline to the 20-day EMA ($0.62). Cardano (ADA) rebounded sharply off the $0.68 support on March 11, but the bulls could not maintain the momentum and overcome the roadblock at $0.80. The long tail on the March 12 candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips to the 20-day EMA ($0.70). This increases the possibility of a break above $0.80. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $0.90. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and plummets below $0.68. That will suggest the bulls have given up and are rushing to the exit. The pair may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.60). The bulls have failed to push and maintain Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.18 resistance in the past few days, but a positive sign is that they have kept up the pressure. The rising 20-day EMA ($0.15) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $0.18, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to $0.21. This level may act as a barrier again, but if cleared, the pair could start its journey to $0.24 and then $0.30. The bears will have to yank the price below $0.14 to get back into the game. The pair could then drop to $0.12 and subsequently to the 50-day SMA ($0.10). Related: Will the Bitcoin halving bring more institutional investors into crypto? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been consolidating in an uptrend as the price is stuck between $0.000029 and $0.000039. A consolidation after a sharp rally is a positive sign as it shows the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. The bulls will try to push the price to the overhead resistance of $0.000039. If this level is cleared, the SHIB/USDT pair could reach $0.46. This level may again pose a solid challenge to the bulls. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the price turns down and breaks below $0.000029. The pair could then slide to the 20-day EMA ($0.000026) and later to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000023. Avalanche (AVAX) surged above the overhead resistance of $45.18 on March 11, indicating that the bulls reasserted their supremacy. The buying continued on March 12, propelling the AVAX/USDT pair above the $50 resistance. Generally, after a breakout from a significant resistance, the price returns to retest the breakout level. Therefore, a drop to $50 is possible. If bulls flip the $50 level into support, it will enhance the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. The pair may then jump to $67. Instead, if the price breaks and sustains below $50, it will indicate aggressive selling at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the 20-day EMA ($44). Toncoin (TON) picked up momentum after breaking above the stiff overhead resistance of $2.90 on March 11. The vertical rally has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought zone, signaling that the markets have run up quickly within a short time. That increases the risk of a correction or consolidation in the near term. The downside support is at $4 and $3.60. On the upside, the rally may face selling near $4.50, but the uptrend may resume if the bulls do not give up much ground. The TON/USDT pair could rise to $5, where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The 59 approvals were granted on March 12. The crypto companies have applied under a deadline of Nov. 30, 2023, according to Bloomberg, and will be regulated under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (FAIS). The act will provide new customer protections and allow regulators to take enforcement actions. It authorizes the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Financial Surveillance Department to conduct supervision.

With these inflows, the spot Bitcoin ETFs now account for nearly 90% of the daily trading volume market share for ETFs offering exposure to BTC, according to data tracked by The Block. These figures show investors\u2019 increasing preference for direct exposure to BTC through ETFs vis-a-vis Bitcoin futures contracts-based products. According to a report by Kaiko Research, BTC\u2019s latest rally, backed by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, is creating about 1,500 millionaire wallets on a daily basis. This highlights the growing wealth accumulation in the cryptocurrency sector. According to the chart above, the total number of wallets with $1 million and $10 million worth of BTC created on a daily basis is less than 2,000. This is a significantly lower number than those created during the 2021 bull run, when \u201cmore than four thousand wallets were reaching the million-dollar mark daily, and more than two thousand wallets were reaching $10M,\u201d noted the report. Kaiko researchers attribute the slower pace of millionaire growth to a lack of new capital, profit-booking by whales as \u201cBTC hits new all-time highs,\u201d and whales storing their \u201choldings with custodians, rather than personal wallets.\u201d The report explained: \u201cIn 2021, there was a huge influx in capital as all manner of bulls sought to benefit from the crypto hype. This time around, whales could be taking a more cautious approach, waiting to see if the gains have legs before investing.\u201d The Kaiko research also revealed steady growth in the overall number of Bitcoin addresses holding significant wealth, underscoring increasing adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and investment asset. Bitcoin\u2019s continued uptrend echoes investors\u2019 positivity, with analysts predicting further gains moving forward. According to Standard Chartered, BTC price might surpass $100,000 by the end of 2024. Hedge fund SkyBridge predicts a price of $170,000 by April 2025, while Fundstrat projects BTC to range between $116,000 and $137,000 by the end of the year. Investment management firm VanEck maintains its medium-term target at $350,000. Independent analyst Ted Talks Macro noted that funds were flowing into the Bitcoin market \u201clike never before,\u201d saying that the pioneer cryptocurrency was on its way to $100,000. As Bitcoin continues to rally, market participants expect the upcoming supply halving slated for April 2024 to propel the price higher.

A March 12 post on the official forum announced the launch of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), a project requesting 200 million ARB tokens for developer onboarding and gaming development. According to the post, the goal of the GCP is to develop a long-term gaming ecosystem on the Arbitrum network: \u201cWe are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a two year period to bolster the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape. The GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to mature into a longer-term gaming program with a more comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\u201d As of the time of this article\u2019s publication, 200 million ARB is worth approximately $426 million. The funds would be partially used for coinvesting in promising studios and games for development on the platform, according to the forum post. The project also shared its key productivity indicators and estimates, a list that includes establishing Arbitrum as \u201cthe de facto leader for on-chain gaming.\u201d Other goals include taking 200 to 300 applications for builders, having 20% or more of all Web3 games select Arbitrum as their base network, 25 new Orbit launches, and more net migrations to Arbitrum versus other layer-2 networks. The proposal also says that, if approved, 40 million ARB would be allocated for infrastructure bounties. These would be paid out on a \u201cper proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum.\u201d The timing of the GCP launch and proposal comes just three days ahead of a scheduled ARB token unlock. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Arbitrum will unlock 673.5 million tokens (worth around $1.34 billion at current prices) for its team and advisers as part of a March 16 \u201ccliff unlock\u201d of about 1.1 billion tokens.

The surge reflects the increasing demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the United States, which saw a record $1 billion in net inflows on March 12. Traders are questioning whether Bitcoin can reach $80,000, given that professional traders are continuing to add bullish leveraged positions. Some analysts argue that Bitcoin (BTC) is being utilized as a hedge against U.S. monetary policy, especially following the 3.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in February compared with the previous year. Consequently, this puts pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to refrain from cutting interest rates further, adding to the risk of an economic recession, as companies have fewer incentives to expand and hire. Conversely, if the pessimistic scenario materializes, with inflation accelerating and the Fed compelled to raise rates further, this could prove detrimental for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. During periods of uncertainty, investors tend to seek refuge in short-term U.S. Treasury and cash positions, even if they have strong long-term convictions in the stock market or real estate. Therefore, whether Bitcoin\u2019s current bull run has the potential to surpass $80,000 hinges on the adoption of spot ETF instruments as a \u201cstore of value\u201d and a potential shift in Bitcoin\u2019s risk assessment. Before 2024, Bitcoin was not easily accessible to the majority of mutual funds and wealth managers. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and its classification as a commodity were major concerns, but this changed after the approval of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 11. Over the past two weeks, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF products have attracted nearly $5 billion in capital, solidifying the industry as a top contender for institutional capital. Nonetheless, some analysts are concerned that the excessive leverage on Bitcoin futures poses a looming risk of liquidations and subsequent price corrections. Bitcoin\u2019s aggregate futures open interest reached its highest-ever level at $35 billion on March 13. Moreover, top traders at crypto exchanges continued to initiate leveraged longs (buy positions). The long-to-short indicator consolidates positions across spot, perpetual and monthly futures contracts, providing a comprehensive view of these traders\u2019 bullish or bearish sentiment. The data suggests that whales and market makers at Binance and OKX increased their net long positions between March 10 and 13. Furthermore, the consolidated metric reached its peak in 30 days, potentially indicating excessive confidence. However, it would be premature to conclude that the risk of a Bitcoin price crash has increased. For instance, arbitrage desks might be using futures markets to anticipate strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, creating a temporary buffer for demand. Known as authorized participants, these institutional investors are authorized by the issuer to create and redeem ETF shares. Hence, the increased demand for leverage could reflect a temporary situation due to the ETF inflow. To confirm whether professional traders are overly confident, one should cross-check data from Bitcoin options markets. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overprice upside or downside protection. In essence, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, while periods of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew. Related: Will the Bitcoin halving bring more institutional investors into crypto? The Bitcoin options\u2019 25% delta skew is currently hovering around optimistic levels, but still within the negative 7% range. Therefore, excessive optimism seems concentrated in futures markets, as put options trade at only a 6% discount compared with equivalent call options. Such data suggests that demand for Bitcoin futures does not imply reckless or heightened risks of cascading liquidation. While there's no guarantee Bitcoin will surpass $80,000 in the near term, BTC derivatives metrics indicate confidence, as traders are pricing similar risks for unexpected upward and downward moves.

The fine was imposed in October, but announced on March 13. It is unclear why the move was not made public at the time or why it was announced now. On Oct. 23, the DNB imposed a fine on Foris DAX MT, commercially known as Crypto.com, of 2.85 million euros ($3 million at the time) for providing crypto services without registration from May 21, 2020, to at least Nov. 8, 2022. May 21, 2020, was the date the DBN introduced registration requirements. Crypto service providers are required to register under the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. The base amount of the fine is 2 million euros, but that was increased due to the severity of the violation and the degree of culpability, the DNB said. Crypto.com enjoyed an advantage over its competition by not paying supervisory fees and compliance costs. Crypto.com had a \u201csignificant number\u201d of customers during that period, and \u201cDAX MT was unable to report unusual transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit-Netherlands during the period of non-compliance\u201d due to its lack of registration.

Another March 13 blog post appears to have been written from the perspective of one of the game\u2019s nonplayer characters. It\u2019s evidently meant to lay out some of the game\u2019s lore. However, with lines such as \u201ctoo long the gate network hasn\u2019t carried thinking meat through its veins,\u201d it\u2019s more of an interesting teaser of what\u2019s to come than an informative view into the game world itself.

According to Binance, the now-turbulent relationship with authorities was quite different a few months ago. In August 2023, for instance, the exchange held two full-day sessions with Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) officials in Abuja and Lagos, each attended by more than 30 investigators. The training focused on instructing investigators to trace money on the blockchain using both public and commercial tools. \u201cWe also introduced several case studies, including those featuring Nigerian suspects. Both sessions received overwhelmingly positive feedback from Nigerian investigators, who expressed strong interest in continuing this format of cooperation,\u201d Binance said. Binance is also said to have responded to 626 information requests from Nigerian law enforcement agencies in an average of 37.4 hours between June 2020 and February 2024, supporting investigations from the Nigeria Police Force, EFCC, and INTERPOL Nigeria. Binance\u2019s blog post is a response to allegations made by the local government that the company has manipulated the national currency, the Nigerian naira (NGN), and contributed to the country\u2019s economic difficulties, calling for a ban on all crypto exchanges operating in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has also expressed concerns about suspicious financial flows through the exchange, estimating that $26 billion passed through Binance Nigeria from unknown users and sources in 2023. The scrutiny led to a fundamental change in Binance\u2019s relationship with the local government, which resulted in two of its senior executives being detained on Feb. 26. Binance has also delisted all Nigerian Naira trading pairs from its peer-to-peer service amid this crackdown. Nigeria is considered one of the fastest-growing crypto economies in the world, ranking second in global crypto adoption as of 2023. However, the naira experienced significant turbulence last year, largely due to economic unrest and low confidence among investors. According to Reuters, the naira fell 36% on the official market in June 2023 after President Bola Tinubu removed trading restrictions and suspended Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.

At the same time, I expect ETH\u2019s price to grow in the long term because the upgrade will make ETH much more valuable in the growing competition of new innovative layer 1 blockchain projects.\u201d But for Mara Schmiedt, CEO of liquid staking development firm Alluvial, the implications of the Dencun upgrade are bullish, even in the short term. \u201cIn light of Bitcoin\u2019s recent institutional surge enabled by recent ETF spot market approvals and total value locked in Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem close to scratching the $100 billion mark, this scalability-focused upgrade is much anticipated,\u201d Schmiedt told Cointelegraph, adding: \u201cEthereum has faced scalability issues that have acted as a blocker to mainstream adoption and accommodating the growing number of users and transactions.\u201d For Onno Sterk, chief operating officer of crypto exchange OSL, the Duncun upgrade is nothing short of significant, as it allows Ethereum to fix critical issues that have hindered the network\u2019s development for years. \u201cThe digital asset space, while revolutionary, has been marred by issues of high transaction fees and limited scalability,\u201d Sterk told Cointelegraph. \u201cThese challenges have not only stifled innovation but also restricted the wider adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors.\u201d He further stated: \u201cAt its core, the Dencun upgrade is centered around proto-danksharding, an innovative approach aimed at drastically reducing transaction fees while simultaneously increasing the network\u2019s processing speed. This development is monumental, as it enables Ethereum to serve as an effective database for other blockchains, thereby facilitating a more interconnected and efficient digital asset ecosystem.\u201d Over the past year, Ether (ETH) has seen a 141% return due to a combination of Dencun upgrade optimism, speculation on the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and a broader crypto market recovery, although the asset has somewhat underperformed Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 198% return during the same period. Although crypto enthusiasts are anticipating a favorable decision on Ether ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in May, not all share the sentiment. \u201cFrom my viewpoint, the SEC will use any excuse to postpone the decision,\u201d said Lienkha, \u201cwhich is why I am not expecting approvals this spring. However, I think the probability of a final positive decision is quite high.\u201d Recently, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, also warned that the odds of an Ether ETF approval in May are not as rosy as one may expect. Meanwhile, Alluvial\u2019s Schmiedt emphasized that in order for Ethereum to reach meaningful adoption, \u201cinstitutional adoption, widespread accessibility, and clear regulatory frameworks\u201d are all necessary factors. \u201cThe success of Ethereum relies on the active participation of its community members, and I\u2018d encourage everyone \u2014 whether you are a developer, user or investor \u2014 to continue contributing your expertise and perspective to help shape the future of Ethereum,\u201d she stated.

Will miners go bankrupt or flee the network? Will the hash rate collapse? Will the price of Bitcoin rise and then fall? Will the halving spur further crypto adoption? And so on. But this much is certain: Every four years, miners\u2019 block rewards are cut in half \u2014 this is pre-coded into the network \u2014 and at some point in April 2024, once the 210,000th block is validated, miners\u2019 rewards will fall from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125. All halvings are both similar and different, but this year\u2019s could be unique because of the new spot market Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), launched in January, which have helped drive the price of Bitcoin to all-time highs, bringing the crypto sector as a whole close to a $3 trillion market capitalization. This raises yet another question: Given that the Bitcoin ETFs appear to have opened many institutions\u2019 eyes to Bitcoin as an alternate asset, will the April halving accelerate the trend? Some think so. \u201cInstitutions are still learning about this asset class, but understanding the monetary policy of Bitcoin will only drive more interest,\u201d Dante Cook, Swan Bitcoin\u2019s head of business, told Cointelegraph. The halving is an important demonstration that \u201cBitcoin security can continue despite a lower \u2018security budget,\u2019\u201d Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Luxor Technology Corporation, told Cointelegraph, adding: \u201cWe expect there to be continued institutional interest in both the underlying commodity and also the companies operating in the space, such as miners.\u201d For institutions that want to buy the coin itself, cutting the block reward in half is arguably an enticement, added Joe Nardini, senior managing director at B. Riley Securities. It\u2019s more evidence that the BTC supply is not going to balloon, which is a \u201cnet positive\u201d for many prospective institutional investors, Nardini told Cointelegraph. However, not all agree that the halving alone will bring large corporations or financial institutions contemplating crypto into the Bitcoin fold. \u201cThe halving shouldn\u2019t have an impact on whether large corporations/institutional investors will invest in Bitcoin for the first time,\u201d Ruben Sahakyan, director of investment banking at Stifel Financial, told Cointelegraph. Investors have clearly embraced the spot market Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 as seen by the net inflows \u2014 and further regulatory clarity will help to drive industry adoption and investor base, continued Sahakyan. \u201cHowever, some investors are on the sidelines when it comes to investing in mining stocks as they await what impact the halving has on miners\u2019 profitability and volatility is reduced.\u201d Others suggested that halvings may not be quite as they used to be, i.e., fraught with drama. \u201cThe halving is likely not as big an event as the industry is well prepared and has been deleveraging in anticipation of the potentially reduced economics,\u201d Taras Kulyk, founder and CEO of SunnySide Digital, an infrastructure provider, told Cointelegraph. \u201cAdditionally, the massive growth of L2 technologies on top of the Bitcoin Network has increased transaction fees \u2014 blunting the impact of the halving even more.\u201d Historically, Bitcoin has risen in price in the months leading up to a halving, which is happening again in 2024. Indeed, a JPMorgan analyst referred at the end of February to a \u201cBitcoin-halving-induced euphoria\u201d gripping the crypto market. But is that really the case? \u201cThere are two major narratives and drivers for Bitcoin currently,\u201d Chris Kuiper, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets (FDA), told Cointelegraph. The first is the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETPs [exchange-traded products], which was a major milestone in Bitcoin\u2019s history and a continued road to adoption.\u201d The second, Kuiper continued, is the upcoming halving. \u201cAs in the past, it\u2019s expected that there will be little effect on the Bitcoin network itself. We may see an initial fall in hash rate, but it will likely only be a matter of time before it recovers to its previous levels and once again moves higher, which wouldn\u2019t affect the operation of the network.\u201d Recent: Can the digital euro actually find traction in Europe? Which of these two events is more impactful? We don\u2019t know if the price surge results from the halving or the spot market Bitcoin ETF approvals, B. Riley Securities\u2019 Nardini said, but it\u2019s more likely \u201cETF induced,\u201d in his opinion. The JPMorgan analyst also warned the price of Bitcoin could drop to $42,000 after the halving. That, too, would follow the script of past halvings. Hash rate \u2014 the overall computing power of the network \u2014 is what makes the Bitcoin network more secure. In the past three halvings (2020, 2016, and 2012), the hash rate fell initially but quickly recovered within six to 31 days. \u201cWhat is different today from historical halvings are the ETFs, which have dramatically changed the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d Clark Swanson, entrepreneur and former CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Blockcap, told Cointelegraph. The new ETFs have created a \u201cdemand shock to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply,\u201d said Swanson. This will \u201cdrive prices even higher and blunt some of the market forces that have traditionally posed challenges for miners.\u201d \u201cPost halving, there is going to be exactly 50% less Bitcoin produced \u2014 or available for sale \u2014 while ETF demand seems to remain, which should continue to drive volatility,\u201d agreed Sahakyan. \u201cSome of the miners have again started building up BTC balance sheets, which further reduces the available supply of Bitcoin.\u201d Others, however, anticipate some surprises. Aki Balogh, co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe supply shock that will come from reduced mining revenues is real and will play some effect.\u201d Some of that has already been priced in, \u201cbut there are unknown second and third-derivative effects that will only come out after the halving has happened,\u201d continued Balogh. Still, \u201cI think scarcity will push the price up somewhat.\u201d In the longer term, history suggests the hash rate will recover, and the price of Bitcoin continue its ascent to new heights. The halving is a unique situation where the block reward periodically decreases, and in this way, \u201cthe inflation rate of the network is pre-coded,\u201d said Vera. \u201cHistorically, we have noticed that the decrease in new Bitcoin issuance has a positive impact on price.\u201d What about traditional BTC proxies like MicroStrategy and some of the larger BTC mining firms? Will they fare better or worse when the dust settles on the 2024 Bitcoin halving? Economically speaking, halvings primarily influence BTC supply, said Balogh, whereas \u201cthe ETFs, MicroStrategy\u2019s well-publicized purchases, and even El Salvador\u2019s daily purchases of BTC impact the demand side.\u201d The spot market ETFs are likely to affect Bitcoin proxies like MicroStrategy more than the halving. Added Balogh: \u201cWill MicroStrategy continue to serve as a proxy for BTC, given that one can buy BTC outright in an ETF? Probably slightly less so than before. It\u2019s cleaner to buy an ETF versus a stock that is controlled by a Board of Directors with unknown objectives.\u201d On the other hand, MicroStrategy recently rebranded itself as a Bitcoin development company, he continued, while the new ETFs \u201care capital-inefficient in the sense that the BTC just sits there. Investors may prefer Michael Saylor\u2019s more active management strategy versus the ETFs.\u201d Cook, for his part, foresaw no diminution in MicroStrategy\u2019s role as a BTC proxy post-halving. \u201cMicroStrategy\u2019s stock is up nearly 450% over the past year and over 250% over the last six months. It\u2019s one of the ways institutions will seek to gain exposure to the asset class of Bitcoin,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. What about miners\u2019 prospects? They\u2019re most directly affected, after all. \u201cEach mining rig has its own profitability price point,\u201d Fidelity\u2019s Daniel Gray noted in a recent blog. \u201cEvery operation will be going into this event assuming they have enough reserves on hand to withstand the negative pressure of the halving.\u201d Maybe the global BTC mining sector today is larger and more stable than in past years. \u201cThe mining sector overall has matured since the last halving and is significantly better positioned, but some will struggle unless the [BTC market] price continues to rise as the network difficulty continues to increase amid outstanding machine orders,\u201d said Stifel\u2019s Sahakyan. \u201cIt appears miners are in better shape overall in terms of lower levels of debt and potentially better control over their costs, such as electricity,\u201d added Kuiper. \u201cWhat\u2019s also helping miners this cycle is the price appreciation before the halving \u2014 something that also hasn\u2019t been seen in previous cycles.\u201d However, \u201cfor smaller miners, it will be tough,\u201d predicted Nardini. They may need to raise capital. Publicly held mining firms, by comparison, will generally have an easier time raising capital. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin miners with one peta hash of mining equipment can count on earning roughly $115 a day, Vera told Cointelegraph, which is \u201ca significant improvement since the beginning of the year given the recent price movement,\u201d but still: \u201cWith the halving coming up and a relentless growth of network hash rate certain miners are going to be at risk of negative profitability post-halving.\u201d Many miners see the writing on the wall \u2014 lower and lower block rewards \u2014 and are looking more at supplemental revenue opportunities. \u201cTransaction fees on the Bitcoin network are crucial for miners long term,\u201d said Vera, \u201cand we are seeing many start investing time and capital into developing the ecosystem of applications being built on Bitcoin.\u201d If one compares the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January with the quadrennial Bitcoin halving in April, which will posterity deem more consequential? Few this past week were willing to say the halving. The halving is \u201csecond in importance to the ETFs,\u201d said Nardini flatly. Still, halvings are unique to Bitcoin and represent a sort of advertisement for what is good and enduring about the cryptocurrency (e.g., it\u2019s \u201chard money\u201d), as well as some of the attendant risks like falling hash rate. Recent: How will the Bitcoin halving affect ETH price? From an adoption standpoint, it\u2019s important for people to see that Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmonetary policy\u201d once again is performing as programmed and expected, Kuiper said, \u201cand it may once again reinforce to investors that Bitcoin, as an asset, is one that\u2019s increasingly becoming scarcer as compared to other financial assets, commodities, or currencies.\u201d Or, as Swanson noted: \u201cIt is the finite supply and the halving of Bitcoin, which are characteristics that help make Bitcoin the hardest money ever created.\u201d For this reason, he added, \u201cIt also may be the first man-made money to survive more than 200 years.\u201d","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #ETF, #Bitcoin Regulation, #Adoption, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #Cryptocurrency Investment"},{"date":"Mar 13, 2024","summary":"","author":"Dilip Kumar Patairya","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/how-to-get-all-erc20-tokens-owned-by-an-address","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"How to get all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address","type":"Blog","category":"How to","content":"Finding ERC-20 token balances in any given wallet is simple; when users open their wallets, they automatically display the balances of all the imported tokens. However, when an individual or an entity, such as law enforcement or a business, needs to ascertain the ERC-20 token balances of another address, direct access to the wallet is not possible. In such cases, an application programming interface (API) can be used to check the balances in a wallet. An API would return all ERC-20 token balances owned by an address and could automate the process of checking token balances. This article discusses how one can use the APIs of Chainbase, Alchemy and Moralis to get information about ERC-20 tokens owned by an address. Chainbase \u2014 a Web3 blockchain interaction layer infrastructure \u2014 offers API services to help developers quickly access and utilize blockchain networks. Its APIs facilitate on-chain data queries. To work with Chainbase, a user needs an account on the platform with an API key, an integrated development environment and a wallet address as input. Register a free account on Chainbase and get access to different APIs and its data cloud. Then log into Chainbase and visit the dashboard. Initiate a new project within the console and obtain an API key. The next is to make an API call to Chainbase to retrieve ERC-20 token balances. The examples below use Javascript. The subsequent action entails executing a HTTP request with JavaScript, utilizing the Axios library to obtain ERC-20 token balances from Chainbase. Use \u201cfetch\u201d to make a HTTP request to retrieve data from a server, as shown in the code snippet below: The code in the above example queries Chainbase to fetch the first five ERC-20 token balances of a wallet (using Vitalik Buterin\u2019s address as an example) on the Ethereum mainnet, displaying the results or any errors encountered. While the native Fetch API is a common way to perform HTTP requests with JavaScript, in the example code, \u201cfetching\u201d is conceptually done by Axios, not by the native Fetch API. To use Axios, the user must install it using \u201cnpm install axios --save\u201d in the terminal. The above code uses Axios in JavaScript to query Chainbase for the first five ERC-20 token balances of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wallet on the Ethereum mainnet. The getAccountTokens API of Chainbase uses the chain ID and wallet address as parameters and returns all ERC-20 token balances the wallet owns. Users can also find information about a specific token by populating the \u201ccontract_address\u201d field. To get data printed, the user must run the command \u201cnode .js\u201d in the terminal. The above code snippet displays balances and information for several ERC-20 tokens, including Eterium, Uniswap V2, dYdX and others, from a given wallet. Alchemy offers APIs that work as a platform layer, reading or writing to the blockchain and delivering the precise information developers want. The following is the procedure to get token balances via Alchemy: Install Node and the Node Package Manager (NPM) on the local machine. Node is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment, while the NPM provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools. On the Alchemy website, sign up for a free account. Then, sign in and navigate to the \u201cAlchemy Dashboard\u201d to create a new app. Set the blockchain to \u201cEthereum\u201d and the network to \u201cMainnet.\u201d Click on the app\u2019s \u201cView Key\u201d button on the dashboard and note the HTTP URL and API key. The URL will be in this form: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxx The next step involves initializing an empty repository and installing the required Node.js dependencies. For API interactions, particularly with the token API, users need to use the Alchemy software development kit (SDK), though Axios or Fetch could serve as suitable alternatives. Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from nodes. Fetch API is a built-in module in Node that facilitates making API requests and handling responses on the server. The Alchemy SDK is a program function library that supports access to the underlying data model and technologies. The code is under-given: The code will create a repository \u201ceth-balance,\u201d which holds all the files and dependencies, and the code will be written in the \u201cmain.js\u201d file. To retrieve token balances, users may utilize the getTokenBalances method, which requires a single argument: the wallet address for which the token balances are desired. Then, a user needs to add the following code to the main.js file. Use the following command to run the script: The output will be displayed as follows: The above code displays the token balances for the wallet at address 0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045, listing each token by its contract address along with the respective balance in hexadecimal format. However, the output of the previous step \u2014 which lists token contract addresses and balances in the smallest units \u2014 is not easy to understand. To obtain detailed token information like name, symbol and decimal count, users should use the getTokenMetadata method. This function \u2014 requiring the contract address as input \u2014 delivers data in a structured format. Moreover, users can refine their script to integrate the getTokenBalances with the getTokenMetadata method. For instance, they can eliminate zero-balance tokens and convert token balances into human-readable forms. Moralis has enterprise-grade Web3 APIs, facilitating the integration of Web3 in any tech stack. The following is the process for using Moralis to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address: Install Node.js v14+ and NPM. Unpack the binary to the installation folder and set the system environment variable for Node. Command npm-install sets up an NPM package and any other packages that it might depend on. Create a free Moralis account, log in to the Moralis dashboard and get the API key. Users can find it in Settings > Secrets. Here, users should locate the \u201cWeb3 API Key - Default\u201d or a similarly named key and copy its value for use in their projects. Moralis provides a \u201cgetWalletTokenBalances\u201d endpoint to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address. It requires two parameters: address and chain. In this context, address represents the specific wallet address being queried for token balances. Chain indicates the particular blockchain network, such as Ethereum, on which those tokens are held. Here is the Javascript code to use: The above code initializes the Moralis SDK, sets it up with a provided API key, and then queries for all ERC-20 token balances associated with a specified Ethereum wallet address, printing the results in a JSON format to the console. Now, users can run the script and find the number of tokens. In JavaScript, users need to enter the following command: The terminal will display the below JSON response: The JSON snippet above details the holdings of ERC-20 tokens in a specific blockchain wallet featuring two tokens: ApeCoin (APE) and Wrapped Ether (WETH). It includes essential information like the contract addresses, names, symbols, logo URLs (when available), decimal precision, and the balances of the tokens within the wallet, expressed in the smallest denomination of each token.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Wallet, #Transactions, #ERC-20, #How to"},{"date":"Mar 13, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/ionet-apple-chip-support-gpu-network","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"io.net adds Apple chip support to its cloud-based GPU-sourcing network","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Recently launched decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) io.net is set to onboard Apple silicon chip hardware for its artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services.

Dencun is the most anticipated hard fork since the Merge and is expected to significantly reduce the transaction fees of layer-2 networks and enhance Ethereum\u2019s overall scalability. While the Dencun upgrade is a step in the right direction, it won\u2019t improve all the shortcomings of layer-2 solutions, according to Arthur Breitman, the co-founder of the Tezos blockchain. He told Cointelegraph: \u201cThe Dencun upgrade does the bare minimum to extend the data usable by rollups on Ethereum, which should lower transaction costs in these L2 solutions. This is a step in the right direction, but ultimately, rollups built on top of Ethereum remain very throughput constrained and are forced to adopt extreme centralization measures.\u201d Dencun\u2019s launch comes nearly a year after the Shanghai upgrade in April 2023, which enabled network participants to unstake their Ether (ETH) for the first time after the network transition to a proof-of-stake network following the Merge. The Dencun hard fork incorporates nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The upgrade\u2019s name combines the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and the Deneb upgrade on its consensus layer. The first part, Cancun, focuses on improving how transactions are managed and processed on the execution layer, while the second part, Deneb, aims to improve the consensus layer, which refers to how network participants agree on the state of the blockchain. The introduction of data blobs via EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding, is among the most notable features of the upgrade, according to James Wo, the CEO and founder of Digital Finance Group. He told Cointelegraph: \u201c[Proto-danksharding] aims to reduce layer-2 transaction fees by enhancing data availability, a crucial move toward establishing Ethereum as a scalable settlement layer.\u201d However, the promised fee reductions won\u2019t affect Ethereum mainnet users, according to a March 6 report by Max Wadington, a research analyst at Fidelity Investments. He wrote: \u201cIn the short term, users who wish to benefit from this fee change must sacrifice some decentralization and security by transacting on L2s instead of Ethereum. This will certainly spur more users to bridge assets elsewhere. However, we strongly believe that transacting on Ethereum for application-specific purposes will still be considered the best option (especially for high-value transactions) in the medium term as L2 platforms continue to mature.\u201d Gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet remain high, above 72 gwei.

Announcing the news in a joint report to Cointelegraph on March 13, Coinbase Wallet and Blockaid said that the new tech was integrated five months ago to provide additional layers of security for Coinbase users. With the integrated Blockaid technology, Coinbase has managed to save more than $75 million of funds from being stolen, the companies said. According to the announcement, the security tool stopped nearly 800,000 wallet connections to malicious decentralized apps (DApps) by scanning and analyzing 114 million transactions and DApp connections. Blockaid CEO Ido Ben Natan told Cointelegraph that the platforms managed to count the number of saved funds by analyzing the malicious transactions presented to users via its integration at the wallet level and calculating the value of the proposed transaction at the given time. \u201cWe are able to confidently say that the minimum number of funds saved for users is over $75 million,\u201d he said. The $75 million is a \u201clower band\u201d to the scams that Blockaid has detected for Coinbase Wallet users, Blockaid CTO Raz Niv told Cointelegraph. \u201cIt takes all the transaction warning screens we gave to Coinbase Wallet users and calculates the value that was blocked on these transactions,\u201d he added. Coinbase Wallet\u2019s integration with Blockaid specifically enabled a better transaction simulation \u2014 a security feature used to predict the outcome of a transaction before it is broadcast to the blockchain. By allowing the platform to anticipate the potential consequences of certain cryptocurrency transactions, transaction simulation enables opportunities to better prevent crypto scams and theft. According to the announcement, Coinbase uses three Blockaid application programming interfaces (API) to layer in security for users when they are browsing DApps, transacting with Web3 protocols or addresses as well as on-chain messaging. With Blockaid\u2019s tech, Coinbase Wallet users better understand what will happen when they sign a transaction, including a transfer of on-chain assets like Ether (ETH) as well as off-chain transactions like a Seaport order on OpenSea. The integration has improved transaction simulations on at least seven chains, including the Ethereum network and six other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, according to Coinbase\u2019s senior director of engineering, Chintan Turakhia. He noted that supported EVM-compatible networks included Base, Optimism and Polygon.

On March 13, a local media outlet, the Bangkok Post, reported that Thailand\u2019s cabinet had approved the tax breaks for investment tokenholders. In the report, the Director-General of Thailand\u2019s Revenue Department, Kulaya Tantitemit, said that individuals who made a profit from holding investment tokens and had a 15% withholding tax deducted could exclude this income when calculating their personal income tax. Tantitemit said that the tax measures, effective Jan. 1, aim to promote fundraising using investment tokens and establish the country as an investment hub.

On March 8, 2022, the country introduced a new tax policy exempting traders on authorized exchanges from a 7% VAT on crypto.

The EU AI Act will govern the bloc of 27 member states to ensure that \u201cAI is trustworthy, safe and respects EU fundamental rights while supporting innovation,\u201d according to the EU Parliament\u2019s website. According to the announcement, the legislation was endorsed by a vote of 523 in favor. There were 46 votes against and 49 abstentions. Cointelegraph attended a virtual press conference before the voting took place, during which EU Parliament members Brando Benifei and Dragos Tudorache spoke to the press, calling it a \u201chistoric day on our long path to regulation of AI.\u201d Benifei said that the final result of the legislation will help create \u201csafe and human-centric AI\u201d with a test that \u201creflects the EU parliament priorities.\u201d The legislation was first proposed five years ago and started picking up speed over the last year as powerful AI models began to be developed and deployed for mass use. Parliament reached a provisional agreement after what Benifei called \u201clong negotiations\u201d in December 2023, and then the Internal Market and Civil Liberties Committees voted 71-8 to endorse the provisional agreement on Feb. 13. As lawmakers lock in their final votes today, Tudorache commented, saying that: \u201cAs a Union, we have given a signal to the whole world that we take this very seriously\u2026 Now we have to be open to work with others\u2026 we have to be open to build [AI] governance with as many like-minded democracies.\u201d After today\u2019s action, minor linguistic changes will be made during the translation phase of the law, when EU laws are translated into the languages of all member states. The bill will then go to a second vote in April and be published in the official EU journal, likely in May, according to a report from EuroNews. In November, any bans on prohibited practices will begin to take effect. According to Benifei these will be mandatory from the time of enactment. Aside from prohibited practices, Benifei clarified that \u201cat the beginning, it will not be fully mandatory. There is a timeline.\u201d The EU AI Act places machine learning models into four categories based on the risk they pose to society, with high-risk models subject to the most restrictive rules. According to the EU\u2019s website \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d is the top category that bans \u201call AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behavior.\u201d Related: Elon Musk makes Grok AI open source amid ongoing OpenAI lawsuit An example of this would include the use of AI-powered remote biometric identification systems to scan faces in public by local authorities. \u201cHigh-risk\u201d applications include critical infrastructures, educational or vocational training, safety components of products, essential private and public services, law enforcement that may interfere with people\u2019s fundamental rights, migration and border control management and administration of justice and democratic processes. \u201cLimited risk\u201d is related to the level of transparency in AI usage. It gives the example of interacting with AI chatbots and the need for users to be aware of interacting with a machine, along with ensuring that AI-generated content is identifiable. The EU has created a tool called \u201cThe EU AI Act Compliance Checker,\u201d which allows organizations to see where they fall within the legislation. The EU\u2019s AI Act makes space for the \u201cfree use\u201d of \u201cminimal-risk\u201d AI, which includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. According to the EU, currently the \u201cvast majority\u201dof AI systems used in the EU are in this category. Additionally, provisions for generative-AI models were added by lawmakers with the explosion in popularity and accessibility of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini. General-purpose AI model developers, including local EU startups and some of the bigger names previously mentioned, will need to hand over detailed summaries of the training data used to train such systems and stay compliant with EU copyright law. Deepfake content that has been generated using AI must also be labeled in accordance with the law as artificially manipulated. Previously, the EU\u2019s AI Act received pushback from local businesses and tech companies who urged authorities not to overregulate emerging AI technologies at the cost of innovation. In June 2023, executives from 160 companies in the tech industry drafted an open letter to EU regulators outlining the implications on local innovation if regulations are too-strict. However, upon approving the world\u2019s first comprehensive set of AI legislation, the EU Parliament received praise from the tech giant IBM in a statement from Christina Montgomery, its vice president and chief privacy and trust officer. She said: \u201cI commend the EU for its leadership in passing comprehensive, smart AI legislation. The risk-based approach aligns with IBM's commitment to ethical AI practices and will contribute to building open and trustworthy AI ecosystems.\u201d Magazine: Truth behind AI reply guys, Copilot picture panic, Trump deepfakes: AI Eye","tags":"#Law, #Europe, #AI, #European Union, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 13, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ezra Reguerra","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/binance-trueusd-stablecoin-trading-pair-delisting","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Binance to delist several TrueUSD trading pairs","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Crypto exchange Binance has announced plans to delist several TrueUSD (TUSD) trading pairs, a stablecoin associated with Tron founder Justin Sun.

Furthermore, the exchange will also delist BNB (BNB) pairs for Arpa and EduCoin. The exchange will delist the pairs on March 15, 2024, at 3:00 am UTC.

However, the exchange clarified that delisting trading pairs does not mean the asset is completely gone from Binance.

At the time of writing, TUSD is paired with prominent crypto tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on Binance. Apart from delisting the trading pairs, Binance also highlighted that it would terminate the spot trading bots services for the pairs on the same date and time. The exchange urged users to update or cancel their bots before the date to avoid potential losses.

The stablecoin fell below its dollar peg earlier this year after holders cashed out hundreds of millions of TUSD in exchange for Tether (USDT). On Jan. 15, the token\u2019s price dropped to $0.984 after traders sold more than $339 million in TUSD tokens.

In addition to data on Binance\u2019s top 100 users, Nigerian authorities have requested Binance pass their transaction history for the past six months, according to a March 13 report by the Financial Times. The office of Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser has also asked Binance to resolve any outstanding tax liabilities, the report notes. The request is part of negotiations between Binance and Nigeria, which argued that Binance had a crucial impact on the local currency, the Nigerian naira. Bayo Onanuga, the presidential adviser on information and strategy, argued that Binance and other crypto platforms manipulated the naira and triggered a massive decline in the local fiat currency. The official also suggested banning platforms like Binance in the country. In response to Binance\u2019s effort to find a dialogue with Nigerian authorities, the local prosecutors detained two senior Binance executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla. The execs remain under detention even after Binance delisted all naira transactions and stopped peer-to-peer naira transactions in late February. Onanuga reportedly said that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were cooperating with Nigerian authorities and providing a \u201clot of information.\u201d He also suggested that Nigeria may seek to impose a $10 billion fine as retribution because they \u201creally messed up\u201d the Nigerian economy. \u201cLet\u2019s allow law enforcement agencies space and time to undertake their work. Outcomes will be made public in due course,\u201d the office of the national security adviser said.

There are increasing signs of overheating, and the Bitcoin price could experience a significant drop before the halving in April. This would fall in line with the 20% pre-halving correction in 2020 and the 38% retracement before the 2016 halving, says pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital. The analyst anticipates the possibility of a retrace during the Bitcoin halving 2024 that can last up to 77 days, though the drawdown might be smaller than in previous cycles. Specifically: \u201cThis year, Bitcoin has experienced a -18% pullback in January and a -14% early March. Therefore it\u2019s possible that a pre-halving retrace, should one occur, would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side.\u201d But what if history doesn\u2019t repeat this time? For instance, the current cycle already differs because the BTC price set a new record high for the first time before the halving even takes place. Secondly, Bitcoin is yet to catch up to its growth trajectory from previous halving cycles, according to historical data shared by Ecoinometrics in a March 12 X post: \u201cIf Bitcoin had followed a growth trajectory similar to the past two cycles we would expect one BTC to be worth anywhere between $100,000 to $300,000 per coin.\u201d Therefore, current price action still has room to run, particularly as the previous all-time high price can now act as the launchpad for more upside before the halving.

In a March 12 earnings release, Core Scientific said its last year\u2019s total revenue was $502.4 million, a decrease of $137.9 million from $640 million in 2022. The yearly revenue drop came from the company leaving the mining rig sales business and an increase in the global Bitcoin hash rate in 2023, it said. Its fourth-quarter 2023net revenue was $141.9 million, an increase of $20.7 million from Q4 2022. Additionally, the firm reported a significant improvement in yearly net losses at just $246.5 million for 2023, down from a $2.14 billion net loss in 2022. In Q4 2023, net losses totaled $195.7 million, narrowing from $434.9 million in Q4 2022. Core Scientific was relisted on the NASDAQ on Jan. 23 after emerging from a bankruptcy crisis and a 13-month restructuring process to resolve $400 million in debt caused by declining Bitcoin (BTC) prices, rising energy costs, and debt tied to the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius. The company reported it mined a total of 13,762 BTC last year, the largest amount mined by any publicly traded mining firm in the United States. Core Scientific saw a nearly 4.6% drop on March 12, ending the day at $3.54 a share. That drop continued in after-hours trading, falling an additional nearly 4% to around $3.40, according to Google Finance. A Core Scientific spokesperson told Cointelegraph the miner wasn\u2019t overly concerned by the market\u2019s tepid response to its Q4 earnings and pointed to dampened price action across the board for publicly traded Bitcoin miners over the past few weeks. Shares in the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) have tumbled 21% over the last month, while rival miner Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has fallen 25% within the same time. Blockware Solutions\u2019 head analyst Mitchell Askew told Cointelegraph on March 1 that the \u201cmost logical\u201d explanation for tumbling miner share prices came from investors growing wary of deploying capital into the firms before the Bitcoin halving \u2014 an event that slashes the rewards paid to miners in half. On Jan. 26, Cantor Fitzgerald released a report outlining that several Bitcoin mining firms may struggle to stay in profit following the Bitcoin halving. At the time of the report, Bitcoin traded for roughly $40,000. Related: Bitcoin\u2019s rally to $72K took miner revenues to record highs At Bitcoin\u2019s current price of $72,000, none of the firms listed in the report will be in the red following the halving \u2014 assuming no significant change in hash rate and that the price of Bitcoin holds above $62,000 after the halving slated for late April. Core Scientific\u2019s spokesperson claimed it was \u201cwell positioned heading into the halving,\u201d adding it had been updating mining rigs with new Bitmain S21 models and was focusing on increasing its hash rate utilization as time went on. Several analysts have flipped bullish on Core Scientific, reflecting a wider trend of renewed market appetite for crypto mining companies following the drastic uptick in BTC and other cryptocurrencies in recent months. Capital market firm HC Wainright upgraded their rating of CORZ from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d in an investment note on Jan. 25. Investment banking research firm Compass Point also upgraded their CORZ rating from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d and set a price target of $8.50 on Jan. 31, per MarketBeat data.

Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and USPTO Director Kathi Vidal stated that NFTs \u201coffer unique opportunities for creators to leverage their IP rights, but also present new challenges in keeping their work secure.\u201d Consumer confusion about IP rights and the legal status of smart contracts was also raised.

In an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, OKX said it had already received the in-principle approval for the license. The MPI license is issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country\u2019s principal financial regulator. After receiving the full license from MAS, OKX will be allowed to provide digital payment token services and cross-border transfers in the country. OKX president Hong Fang said that Singapore was always a priority for the exchange in terms of its global strategy. The executive explained that Singapore attracts entrepreneurs venturing into new markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a market of early adopters who are well-versed in technology.\u201d Fang also described the country\u2019s regulatory framework as \u201cclear and thoughtful,\u201d allowing businesses to \u201cbuild better for the long-term.\u201d Fang also explained that with the new milestone, the company would focus on its spot product in Singapore. In the future, the executive said that OKX will work on bringing local banking connections to its customers and expand its offerings. MPI-licensed companies are allowed to facilitate multiple payment services exceeding the volume limitations set for payment firms. This means that OKX could exceed the 3 million Singapore dollars (about $2.2 million) limit for any payment service and the monthly limit of 6 million SG$ ($4.4 million) for two or more payment services. The in-principle license approval comes after OKX secured a conditional license from Dubai\u2019s crypto regulator. On Jan. 16, Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority awarded OKX a license allowing the company to offer regulated services for virtual asset service providers in the region.

Other crypto organizations, including Crypto.com, Coinbase and Ripple, have obtained complete payment institution licenses in Singapore. In June 2023, Crypto.com secured its MPI license after completing the requirements set by the regulator.

As of March 12, the total assets under management (AUM) in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) slumped to $28.5 billion \u2014 with Grayscale now accounting for 48.9% of the total $56.7 billion held between ten U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, according to Dune Analytics data. On the first trading day of the ten U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale\u2019s fund accounted for around 99.5% of their total AUM. Over time, consistent daily outflows from the GBTC \u2014 which averaged $329 million per day last week \u2014 have eaten away at the ETF\u2019s market share. GBTC outflows were most sizeable within the first month of Bitcoin ETFs going live \u2014 with $7 billion leaving the fund in a little over a month \u2014 but began slowing in late January, leading some analysts to suggest that they could be coming to an end. However, in mid-February, bankruptcy courts allowed crypto lender Genesis to liquidate roughly $1.3 billion worth of GBTC shares as part of efforts to reimburse investors, seeing outflows pick up again. In total to date, GBTC outflows have reached just over $11 billion, per Farside Bitcoin ETF flow data. Grayscale\u2019s ETF was initially a trust that allowed institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin by locking up funds for at least six months. However, after a court win over the Securities and Exchange Commission in August and the regulator\u2019s following approvals of other spot Bitcoin ETF applications, the trust was converted into an ETF. This allowed institutional investors \u2014 who took advantage of a GBTC arbitrage trade \u2014 to remove their capital from the fund for good or simply shift their assets to Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees.

Roman Sterlingov, 35, was found guilty of money laundering, money laundering conspiracy, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violations of the D.C. Money Transmitters Act. Sterlingov, however, had argued throughout the trial that he was only a user of the service, and not its operator. His attorney, Tok Ekeland said in a March 12 X post that his team will appeal the verdict. According to evidence presented at the trial, Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog from October 2011 to April 2021, which acted as a money laundering service for \u201ccriminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement.\u201d The service moved over 1.2 million Bitcoin (BTC) over the decade-long operation \u2014 worth $400 million at the time of the transactions \u2014 with the bulk of cryptocurrency coming from darknet marketplaces tied to narcotics, computer fraud abuse and identity theft, the government said. Bitcoin Fog also served distributors of child sexual abuse material. Evidence used to convict Sterlingov found that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of crypto deposited to his crypto exchange accounts came from \u201cBitcoin clusters\u201d associated with Bitcoin Fog. \u201cEvidence presented at trial clearly showed that the defendant laundered hundreds of millions of illicit funds from the dark web through Bitcoin Fog in an attempt to conceal the origin of those funds,\u201d said Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Chief Jim Lee. Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division also stated that the division is \u201ccommitted to unmasking and prosecuting those who use technology to hide their crimes, no matter how sophisticated the scheme may be.\u201d J.W. Verret, a professional witness in the case, has also pledged to help Sterlingov\u2019s appeal. Verret has long argued that the on-chain forensics used to accuse Sterlingov is flawed. \u201cThe trial lasted four weeks. I testified for a full day and I worked on the case for a year,\u201d said Verret, adding: \u201cThe verdict, issued March 12, was \u2018guilty.\u2019 They say it four times as the four counts of the indictment are read. It felt like I was punched in the stomach. The only way my brain can process it is to focus on strategies for appeal.\u201d The jury has granted forfeiture of assets seized from the crypto mixer, which includes 1,354 BTC held in a Bitcoin Fog wallet and nearly $350,000 in various cryptocurrencies held in a seized Kraken account. The most serious charges \u2014 money laundering conspiracy and money laundering sting \u2014 each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the other two charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

Hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money from darknet sites like Silk Road and AlphaBay were allegedly laundered through it. The prosecution said Roman not only used it, but ran it. Defense counsel Tor Ekeland and Mike Hassard fought like lions against every motion and objection \u2014 like Paul Newman in \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d but with a crypto-tech twist. The prosecution\u2019s case largely mirrored the original indictment. It focused on a Bitcoin transaction from Sterlingov\u2019s Mt. Gox account that traveled to a Bitcoin wallet. We don\u2019t know who owned that wallet or held its private key. From there, a series of transactions were eventually linked to the purchase of a Bitcoin Fog clearnet site that described how to find Bitcoin Fog on the darknet. Sterlingov may have sold Bitcoin to someone who bought the Bitcoin Fog website, or that someone may have later sold Bitcoin to someone who then sold it to someone else \u2014 and so forth \u2014 who eventually purchased the domain. Roman Sterlingov was convicted on all four counts. Been working on this pro bono case for a year. Will have more to say but for now I just feel dead inside. \u2014 BlockProf (@JWVerret) March 12, 2024 The government harped on how Sterlingov used Bitcoin Fog. He testified that, yes, he regularly used Fog for privacy. The government only claimed that Sterlingov sent 2,700 Bitcoin through Bitcoin Fog. Yet I testified that the true operator of Fog would have earned 24,000 to 36,000 Bitcoin based on Fog\u2019s fees. I showed that would be hundreds of millions of dollars, the same as a flipped government witness, Larry Harmon, testified he earned running the related Bitcoin mixer Helix. Yet the government\u2019s IRS witness showed that Roman never spent more than $60,000 a year, lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and was never worth more than $1.8 million over the ten years they watched him. Related: Bitcoin just hit a record in open interest \u2014 expect imminent volatility The \"Perry Mason\" moment was a catch by defense expert Jeff Fishbach. The government\u2019s evidence included their description of a screenshot of a text message chain discussing a money laundering plan by the defendant. Turns out, it was just a picture from an e-book the defendant was reading on his computer! Ouch. During closing the prosecution apologized for their mistake but promised it was their only one. The prosecutors C. Alden Pelker and Chris Brown wrote a Justice Department publication advising prosecutors against bringing cases based on tracing alone. They suggested using corroborating evidence like possession of a private key to Bitcoin addresses holding illicit funds. Good advice since the academic literature shows Chainalysis heuristics can be wrong 90% of the time. That's not something to build a case on when someone faces decades in prison. Yet in this case, prosecutors made precisely the mistake they urged other prosecutors against. A key problem: The Chainalysis \u201cco-spend\u201d heuristic assumes that Bitcoin spent together originates from the same user, yet is frustrated by splitting a dinner check with a friend using Bitcoin. Likewise, its \u201cpeel chain\u201d heuristic assumes that unspent Bitcoins are linked along a chain where the bigger transaction is the spender keeping their \u201cchange.\u201d Yet this is defeated if you send the larger Bitcoin amount to another person within that chain. It's also defeated if you simply give another person the private key in an off-chain transaction, which was more common in the early years of Bitcoin examined in this case. These two tracing heuristics were at the heart of Chainalysis tracing in this case. The Chainalysis expert testified about critiques of her tools and suggested a secret sauce in the Chainalysis source code fixes them. Since the code is proprietary she can\u2019t share it and we should just trust her. Roman was early to Bitcoin, in that way he was lucky. He was also an early user of Bitcoin Fog for privacy, he had a Russian passport, and he was into computers. That made him an easy mark to pin the operation of Fog onto. In that way he may have been the unluckiest person I\u2019ve ever met.

Under the proposals in the consultative paper, MLRs-regulated institutions would require FCA regulation as well, but no longer be required to seek MLRs authorization. Under the current FSMA regime, crypto assets are under FCA control \u201cif they serve as the underlying asset or property for regulated activities or financial instruments, such as in collective investment schemes.\u201d The reach of the FSMA will be extended to new activities, such as operating a crypto asset exchange and custody.

COPA presented its argument first. Arguments are expected to last three or four days. COPA is seeking injunctive relief to prevent Wright from further claiming to be Nakamoto. As the claimant, COPA bears the burden of proof in the case; that is, it has to show that Wright is not Nakamoto. Wright has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto since 2016. Wright has been accused of massive forgery of the documents he used to support his claim of being Nakamoto. According to COPA\u2019s closing submission: \u201cDr Wright has been shown to have lied on an extraordinary scale. [\u2026] He has invented an entire biographical history, producing one tranche after another of forged documents to support it.\u201d COPA stated in its closing submission that it would seek to have documents submitted by Wright in the case referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be considered for perjury charges.

Despite failing to sustain levels above $4,000, Ether managed to reach its highest price in over two years, closing the gap versus the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), in the period. Some traders argue that Ether\u2019s bull run has been solely dependent on the spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision, creating a potential \u201csell the news\u201d scenario if the event gets fully priced in, at least in the initial weeks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give its final verdict on the matter by May 23, with Bloomberg analysts pointing to approval odds at 35%. Other factors have contributed to the recent price gains, including the Dencun network upgrade scheduled for March 13. The hard fork is expected to drastically reduce transaction fees of Ethereum network\u2019s scaling solutions, a problem that has plagued the network for a long time. Specifically, the 7-day average Ethereum transaction fee has stood at $4 or higher since November 2023. Ether critics argue that Bitcoin reached an all-time high on March 12 while Ether remains 19% lower than the November 2021 peak of $4,870. However, Ether\u2019s current $480 billion market cap puts the cryptocurrency in the top 20 global tradable assets, ahead of UnitedHealth and ExxonMobil. To put things in perspective, those companies posted 12-month profits of $22.4 billion and $36 billion, respectively. Ether investors enjoy a 4% yield when participating in the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus, but the demand for ETH largely depends on the ecosystem\u2019s activity. Regardless of occurring on the second layer, the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem is beneficial for Ether\u2019s price, as ETH is required for validating and processing transactions on the base layer, besides being used as collateral in some decentralized applications (DApps). The latest data leaves little doubt about the Ethereum network\u2019s dominance, especially when layer-2 solutions are included. Additionally, even during periods of $20 or higher transaction fees, the Ethereum base layer has amassed nearly 590,000 active addresses, and its volumes continue to grow. Yet, a more granular view is required to understand if the growth was restricted to a handful of projects due to airdrops or other factors that might have propelled the short-term demand. Data shows consistent growth across major decentralized exchanges (DEX) and aggregators but was slightly disappointing for the nonfungible token marketplaces. In essence, the Ethereum network use is not particularly promising given that the tenth-largest DApp, ParaSwap, exhibited a mere 7,100 active addresses in the past week. As a comparison, BNB Chain\u2019s tenth-largest DApp, Jumper Exchange, had 36,500 active addresses in the same period. To assess whether professional traders are skeptical of Ether flipping $4,000 into support, one should analyze the Ether futures. In neutral markets, the monthly futures contracts should trade 5% to 10% higher than regular spot markets to account for their extended settlement period. Related: CoinShares acquires Valkyrie\u2019s ETF business The Ether annualized futures premium, commonly referred to as the basis rate, jumped to its highest level in over 18 months on March 11. Levels above 25% typically indicate excessive optimism, but not necessarily an imminent risk as traders can seek alternative funding methods when the opportunity arises. Similarly, the high premium attracts arbitrage investors willing to short the futures while simultaneously buying spot ETH, therefore balancing out the equation in the medium term. Ultimately, no matter how pro traders are bullish, the risk of a sell-off increases the longer it takes for Ether to break above $4,000 while the futures premium remains high.

Data from Blockchain.com shows that daily Bitcoin (BTC) mining rewards spiked to $78.89 million on March 11 for the first time in history, surpassing the previous high of $74.4 million set in October 2021. Miner revenues primarily come from rewards for creating new blocks and confirming transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners currently receive 6.25 BTC for every successful block they create in addition to transaction fees. Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high of $72,953 on March 12. It has since retraced back to $69,655, but it is still up 246% in the last 12 months, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Similarly, the mining industry has witnessed 212% revenue growth in U.S. dollars, as shown in the chart above. Bitcoin mining revenue climbed from $25.23 million on March 17, 2023, to roughly $78.89 million on March 11. More data from Blockchain.com reveals that the Bitcoin hash rate has also increased over the last year to reach an all-time high of 676 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Feb. 2. This means that more miners are joining to secure the pioneer blockchain network. At the time of publishing, the Bitcoin hash rate stood at around 642.9 EH/s. The increase in Bitcoin miner revenue and hash rate can be explained by the uptick in on-chain activity. This week, the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network also reached an all-time high of 974.7 million transactions. This was a 20% increase over the last 12 months. While the rally in BTC\u2019s price has been attributed to increased capital inflow into the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the upcoming supply halving event is another important event to watch. The Bitcoin halving occurs once every four years and refers to a situation where miner rewards are reduced by 50%. The next halving is expected in April, just under 35 days away, and will reduce miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Related: Bitcoin has 6 months until ETF \u2018liquidity crisis\u2019 \u2014 New analysis In preparation for this, miners have been using profits from the latest BTC rally to buy more equipment to double their operations in order to remain afloat after the reduced earnings, according to a Bloomberg report. More data from TheMinerMag reveals that 13 major Bitcoin mining firms have ordered over $1 billion worth of mining rigs over the last month. The latest is Bitfarms, which acquired an additional 10 EH/s Bitcoin miners for $143 million. On-chain data from Glassnode shows evidence that Bitcoin miners are taking profits on the latest rally in BTC price. The factors influencing the offloading could be preparation for reduced earnings after the halving, increased mining difficulty and the hash rate reaching record highs. These levels of miner selling are normal in a bull market, as shown in the chart below. This is especially true for the huge increase in on-chain transactions, as mentioned above. Miners are selling heavily. More data from Glassnode shows BTC balances in miner wallets have dropped to a three-year low of 1.8 million BTC, validating the offloading. Therefore, as Bitcoin\u2019s price increases, miner revenues are growing, and more profit bookings are occurring among these market participants.

According to the tech pioneer, the next chapter of internet history will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and a Big Tech reshuffle. Speaking to CNBC, Berners-Lee said that trustworthy AI assistants would mark a turning point for interaction. \u201cOne of the things I predict,\u201d said Berners-Lee, \u201cis you will have an AI assistant, which you can trust, and it works for you, like a doctor.\u201d His second prediction is that humans will gain ownership of their data and that VR and spatial computing (essentially, being immersed in the metaverse) will become the go-to modality for using computers. Per the CNBC interview: \"You can go do things with a VR headset, and then when you take the VR headset off, you could do it with a huge screen. And whenever you move, you can grab your phone and the experience will be as one. It should very smoothly go between different devices.\u201d The gist of this prediction is that spatial computing \u2014 movement in a physical space that correlates to action in the digital space \u2014 will supplant the keyboard, mouse and touchscreen paradigms. While Berners-Lee didn\u2019t mention Web3, cryptocurrency or blockchain tech during the published interview, metaverse and spatial computing technologies are intrinsically related. His third prediction was that in the future, some agencies may work to break up Big Tech conglomerates. This might seem like a no-brainer to industry insiders, but Berners-Lee\u2019s mention of it highlights the potentially precarious nature of even the largest corporation in the United States, as seen through the eyes of one of computer science\u2019s most notable figures. Interestingly, Berners-Lee\u2019s first contribution to the invention of the World Wide Web came while working as a contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, otherwise known as CERN, in 1980. In 1989, he implemented the hypertext network he\u2019d created at CERN with a networking protocol (TCP) and a domain name service (DNS) to create the skeleton of what would eventually become the World Wide Web.

Therefore, all references to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust throughout the Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information are replaced with references to Bitcoin ETPs.\u201d This move expands the fund\u2019s investment option to include all exchange-traded products (ETPs), rather than the Grayscale fund. Patient Capital Management stated in the new filing that it intends to invest up to 15% of its capital in BTC ETPS. The firm had $1.4 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Dec. 31, 2023, so its BTC investment could run over $200 million. The fund may be planning a hodling strategy for its BTC. According to its website: \u201cIn this market, we believe volatility is the price you pay for long-term returns.\u201d Patient Capital Management stated in its filing that the fund would bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of BTC and that \u201ccountries, including the U.S., in the future may restrict or outlaw the acquisition, use, or sale of bitcoin.\u201d Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the SEC to register a new \u201cmini\u201d version of its exchange-traded fund (ETF) on March 11. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggested that the new fund sought to provide tax advantages. As competition for investors heats up, Grayscale is at an increasing disadvantage due to its comparatively high management fee of 1.5% annually.

Victims were sourced via a popup ad on their computers. The ad stated that the victim\u2019s computer had been compromised and gave them a fake customer support number to contact. Upon contacting the number, they were then informed that their bank accounts had also been affected and transferred to another scammer posing as a support agent. The victims were then directed to transfer their bank funds to USDT in order to supposedly keep it safe.

Using Core Lightning as the base implementation, Greenlight allows all operations involving private keys to be performed on a user\u2019s device as the signer. The remainder of the node and operational needs run on Blockstream\u2019s infrastructure. Blockstream built its signer on the Validating Lightning Signer project to ensure end-to-end verification. This means only users can initiate operations involving their funds, not the infrastructure operator or anyone with similar control or access. The design is similar to hardware wallets, where a user has a client interface and signer, while the wallet provider operates a Bitcoin node that connects to the network. User-controlled elements can initiate payments and sign invoices while Blockstream runs the node. Relai was founded in 2020 with a sole focus on Bitcoin trading and custody. The app has generated over $300 million in trading volume over the past four years. Relai\u2019s decision to onboard Lightning payments comes off the heels of some of the biggest exchanges looking to improve their Bitcoin payment functionality. Coinbase, the largest exchange operator in the United States, announced that it would integrate Bitcoin Lightning payments into its offering in September 2023. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong cited Bitcoin\u2019s position as the most important asset in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and said that its functionality would help facilitate faster and cheaper BTC transactions.

Three previous Bitcoin halvings have occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, July 9, 2016, and May 11, 2020. This time, the halving follows the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., massively increasing the hype around the event. The ETFs are not the only factor increasing expectation levels. Julian Grigo, head of institutions and fintech for Safe \u2014 the creators of SafeWallet \u2014 told Cointelegraph the Bitcoin halving is an important reminder of what separates Bitcoin from fiat currency. This Bitcoin halving comes following a period of higher-than-average global inflation. \u201cAfter two years of higher inflation in the U.S. and the eurozone and even higher in other economic areas, an asset with a fixed supply is really appealing to investors,\u201d said Grigo. \u201cThe Bitcoin halving event will serve as a reminder of that.\u201d \u201cIt reminds global investors and observers of one of the key features of Bitcoin: a fixed supply schedule that no one can change. In this regard, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies stand in stark contrast to currencies issued by nation states such as the U.S. dollar.\u201d According to Grigo, however, this limited supply is even more true of Ether (ETH) right now. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s supply is still growing \u2014 just at a lower speed. In contrast, Ether\u2019s supply is actually decreasing. From that perspective, Ether can be seen as an even better store of value [...] Therefore, I would not be surprised to see Ether benefiting from the halving event even more so than Bitcoin,\u201d he said. Joey Garcia, director and head of public affairs, policy and regulation at Xapo Bank, told Cointelegraph he expects the halving to be a positive for Ethereum and the broader market. Garcia states, \u201cThe mechanism is designed to mimic the scarcity and deflationary aspect of precious metals.\u201d He adds, \u201cThe indirect effect that this can have on Ethereum and the broader market is interesting.\u201d He said the halving can positively affect market sentiment and \u201cresult in more resources and innovation flowing into wider ecosystems like Ethereum.\u201d Recent: Is GameFi subject to the same market forces as the traditional game industry? The scarcity Garcia refers to is halving Bitcoin mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Naturally, this is expected to put increased pressure on the supply side of Bitcoin. Alun Evans, co-founder of Laos Network, a universal layer-1 for digital assets, told Cointelegraph, \u201cWhile this event directly impacts Bitcoin, its implications are felt across the entire crypto ecosystem, including Ethereum.\u201d Evans adds, \u201cThe reduced supply of new coins entering the market can lead to scarcity. If Bitcoin\u2019s price rises post-halving, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies will likely experience price increases as investors diversify their portfolios.\u201d Evans believes this may not be the wholly positive news many think it is. He told Cointelegraph that there could be some downside to rapid price appreciation in ETH. Evans argues, \u201ca surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is not entirely beneficial. While Bitcoin serves mainly as a digital storage of value or as a payment method, Ethereum underpins various applications and smart contracts.\u201d Therefore, a more volatile and unpredictable market could make Ethereum usage less palatable for users and developers alike. That\u2019s an issue Ethereum developers will have to contend with during the next bull cycle. \u201cAs Ethereum network costs increase, we\u2019ll continue to see alternative layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions (e.g., multi-Ethereum Virtual Machine superchains) to improve the network\u2019s scalability and reduce transaction fees, making it more accessible and cost-effective for users and developers,\u201d says Evans. While there are those attributing positive market action to Bitcoin and the halving, others point to additional factors. Siddharth Lalwani, CEO of Range Protocol \u2014 an infrastructure Web3 liquidity \u2014 is among those looking elsewhere to explain positive price appreciation for Ethereum. \u201cBitcoin continues its parabolic rally as investors anticipate the upcoming supply halving event in the next few weeks,\u201d Lalwani told Cointelegraph. \u201cReflected across steady inflows to Bitcoin ETFs, there are three core catalysts driving net positive market action: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade in March, the Bitcoin halving in April, and the prospect of spot Ethereum ETF approvals by the SEC in May.\u201d But while most analysts are focusing on the positives of upward Bitcoin momentum, Lalwani predicts that Ethereum may lose out in the shorter term. \u201cAs Bitcoin surges to all-time highs, liquidity is momentarily pulled from other sources like Ethereum and altcoins. Once the attention from Bitcoin moves away to the potential of an Ethereum ETF, liquidity will retrace and consolidate at high levels, leading to price rallies for the macro outlook,\u201d said Lalwani. Ultimately, Lalwani expects \u201ca bullish trend to prevail for overall crypto markets in 2024.\u201d Jordi Alexander, chief alchemist at Mantle \u2014 a network for Ethereum rollups \u2014 is another who argues that Ethereum price appreciation shouldn\u2019t be attributed solely to the halving. \u201cThe sheer force of rallying Bitcoin prices has seen evident knock-on effects for Ethereum, backed by a resurgence of investor interest in crypto. Major industry milestones from the Ethereum Dencun upgrade happening in March, to Bitcoin halving in April and the possibility of a spot Ethereum ETF launch in May have sparked excitement all around,\u201d Alexander told Cointelegraph. Alexander added that \u201cthese events are predictable and largely priced in.\u201d Despite this, Alexander maintains that both Bitcoin and Ethereum remain great long-term investments. \u201cAs long as these two assets continue to have buyers, new money inflows will keep coming in \u2014 but at some point, there will be no tokens left to buy [...] We will eventually hit a point where token issuance becomes very low, and the supply squeeze will set in, leading to explosive movements.\u201d Aki Balogh is the co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link, a Web3 infrastructure enabling Bitcoin holders to self-wrap and engage with decentralized finance. Balogh told Cointelegraph he is very bullish on Bitcoin due to the halving, Ordinals and MicroStrategy \u201ccornering the market,\u201d all of which are \u201cfurther reducing the supply.\u201d Recent: Can the digital euro actually find traction in Europe? Balogh points out that \u201cETH and other tokens are highly correlated to BTC.\u201d \u201cA lot of hedge traders trade ETH and other tokens against BTC instead of U.S. dollars to minimize [foreign exchange] risk. So, if BTC goes up, it will have a secondary effect of increasing the values of ETH and other tokens,\u201d he said. As Grigo neatly summarizes, \u201cThe Bitcoin halving is a megaphone for crypto as a new asset class, but Ethereum might have the loudest echo.\u201d","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Ethereum, #Bitcoin Price, #Investments, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving, #Ether Price, #Ethereum Price"},{"date":"Mar 12, 2024","summary":"","author":"Christopher Roark","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/old-trust-wallet-ios-vulnerability-from-2018-may-still-affect-some-accounts","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Old Trust Wallet iOS vulnerability from 2018 may still affect some accounts","type":"Blog","category":"Investigation","content":"An old vulnerability in the Trust Wallet iOS app may still affect individuals who created accounts with it \u2014 even if they no longer use Trust Wallet \u2014 according to a recent report from security researchers at SECBIT Labs. The vulnerability only existed from Feb. 5 through Aug. 21, 2018 and does not affect accounts created after that time period, the researchers stated. However, some users may be unaware that the vulnerability existed and may still be planning to use the exposed wallets. The vulnerability was caused by two functions called by the Trust wallet in a Trezor library that were supposed to only be used for testing. Yet despite developer notes warning developers against their use, Trust Wallet accidentally included these functions in its iPhone wallet app, SECBIT claimed. This error allegedly allowed attackers to guess the private keys of some users and steal their funds. According to SECBIT, these accounts are still vulnerable even now. This newly revealed vulnerability is allegedly separate and distinct from Trust Wallet\u2019s browser extension flaw, which the Trezor team already acknowledged in April 2023. In a Feb. 15 blog post responding to SECBIT\u2019s claims, Trust Wallet stated that the vulnerability only affected a few thousand users, who were all notified and migrated to new wallets. Trust Wallet claimed that it patched the vulnerability in July 2018 and that its app is currently safe to use. The research team said it ran across the flaw while investigating a widespread attack on crypto wallets that occurred on July 12, 2023 that affected over 200 cryptocurrency accounts. Many of the accounts attacked had not been used for months or were stored on devices with no internet access, which should have made them extremely difficult to hack. In addition, the victims used many different wallet apps, with Trust Wallet and Klever Wallet being the most commonly used. This made the causes of the hack difficult to pinpoint, which piqued the curiosity of the researchers. Upon further investigation, the researchers discovered that most of the victims\u2019 addresses had first received funds between July and August 2018. However, their investigation came to a dead end shortly after this discovery, and they moved on to other research. Then, on Aug. 7, 2023, the Distrust cybersecurity team announced that it had allegedly discovered a vulnerability in the Libbitcoin Explorer Bitcoin (BTC) app. Called \u201cMilk Sad,\u201d this Libbitcoin vulnerability allowed attackers to guess users\u2019 private keys. After reading about this alleged flaw, the SECBIT team began to suspect that a similar flaw may have caused the July 12 attack. The researchers reopened the investigation and began looking through versions of the Trust Wallet code published from July through August 2018. They discovered that the iOS versions of the app from this period used functions \u201crandom32()\u201d and \u201crandom_buffer()\u201d from Trezor\u2019s crypto iOS library to generate mnemonic phrases. These functions had developer notes warning against their use in production apps. For example, the notes for random32() stated, \u201cThe following code is not supposed to be used in a production environment. [...] It\u2019s only included to make the library testable. [...] The message above tries to prevent any accidental use outside of the test environment.\u201d After investigating the code, the researchers allegedly discovered that it generated seed words that were not random enough to prevent them from being guessed by an attacker. This meant that any Trust Wallet account generated on an iOS device during this time was at risk of being drained, SECBIT claimed. Related: US investigates Trust Wallet iOS app for vulnerability In its report, SECBIT claimed to have generated a database of compromised addresses, which it then forwarded to the Trust Wallet team. It also claimed to have compared these addresses with the victims of the July 12 hack and found that 83% of the victims had wallets generated using the random32() and random_buffer() functions. When Trust Wallet was confronted with this information, it allegedly told SECBIT it had already notified users privately in 2018. It also emphasized that the addresses had balances of zero and, therefore, could not be warned against losing funds. SECBIT alleged it urged Trust Wallet to publicly announce the vulnerability but that Trust Wallet did not comply. The firm says it published its findings only after Trust Wallet failed to make this public disclosure. Despite its critical report, SECBIT pointed out that Trust Wallet is open-source, so some other wallet developer may have forked the code and caused its users to generate vulnerable addresses, or another wallet developer may have independently made the same mistake as Trust Wallet by using the Trezor crypto iOS library from this period to generate addresses. Researchers opined: \u201cOf course, the Trust Wallet may not be the only one who misused the trezor-crypto library. There may be many other unknown projects that have similar vulnerabilities. Someone could even blame the trezor-crypto library for quietly changing to an insecure default implementation, causing fatal flaws in projects that use it as an underlying dependency.\u201d According to SECBIT, Trezor updated its library on July 16, 2018, adding production-ready versions of the two functions. Even so, the vulnerability may still affect some users who created accounts in early 2018 but have never sent funds to them, the researchers claimed. Cointelegraph reached out to Trust Wallet for comment. In response, a representative pointed to the team\u2019s Feb. 15 public statement about the issue. In this statement, the development team emphasized that the current version of Trust Wallet does not contain the vulnerability. \u201cWe want to assure Trust Wallet users that their funds are safe and the wallets are safe to use,\u201d the spokesperson stated. \u201cThough there was a previous vulnerability in our open-source code in early 2018 affecting a few thousand users only,\u201d they continued, \u201cthe vulnerability was quickly patched with the support of the security community \u2014 and affected users were notified and migrated into safe wallets.\u201d Trust Wallet pushed back against claims that it had not adequately informed users. \u201cTrust Wallet\u2019s founder took swift and proactive steps to inform all impacted users and provided them with a secure migration path,\u201d said the spokesperson, \u201censuring no user was left vulnerable.\u201d Trust Wallet also denied that most of the hacks were against accounts its app generated. Only \u201c600 addresses out of the 2,000s hacked\u201d were found in its user database, implying that most victims were not Trust Wallet users. Of these 600 users, some of them could have imported their addresses from another app, Trust Wallet claimed. In contrast to SECBIT\u2019s statement that 83% of the victim addresses were produced by the flawed code, Trust Wallet stated that \u201conly one-third of them have the 2018 Trust Wallet historical vulnerability.\u201d In its report, the team encouraged security researchers to make use of its bug bounty program and claimed that it is committed to keeping its wallet secure. Related: Trust is the best strategy in crypto bear market \u2014 Trust Wallet CEO In a July 12, 2023 report, the Klever wallet also confirmed that some of the victims of the attack had used its app. However, it claimed that all of the addresses had been imported and were not originally created by Klever. Cointelegraph reached out to Trezor for comment. In response, the firm\u2019s chief technology officer, Tom√°≈° Su≈°√°nka, emphasized that the function at the core of the controversy was solely meant for testing and not for official project development use: \u201c[The function is] exactly as described in the source code, the function is not meant to be used in a production environment, and we provide explicit warnings of this. The function is replaced with a secure RNG on the Trezor itself. This function is meant solely for testing. We love open-source, but it is unrealistic to expect us to prevent any possible misuse of the many projects we have open-sourced. These projects are provided as is, without any warranties, as their licenses clearly depict.\u201d In SECBIT\u2019s report, researchers warned iOS users with Trust Wallet accounts from this time period to migrate to new wallets and stop using the old ones. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming that users may still use wallets created during the vulnerable period,\u201d they stated. \u201cWithout awareness of the issue, they may face further loss of funds.\u201d","tags":"#Blockchain, #Ethereum, #Trezor, #Hackers, #Cybersecurity, #Hacks, #Trust Wallet"},{"date":"Mar 12, 2024","summary":"","author":"Gareth Jenkinson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/starknet-impact-ethereum-dencun-hard-fork","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Starknet anticipates significant impact from Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Layer-2 scaling protocol Starknet aims to double the impact of lowered costs for rollups after Ethereum\u2019s latest hard fork, Dencun, takes effect on March 13. The Starknet Foundation announced the rollout of additional fee-saving initiatives on its protocol that will coincide with the Dencun upgrade. The hard fork is arguably the most significant upgrade to Ethereum\u2019s protocol since its shift to proof-of-stake consensus in October 2022. Dencun includes Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-4844), which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. Related: Make Ethereum cheap again: \u2018Blobs\u2019 to be launched via Dencun upgrade on March 13 EIP-4844 creates a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing blob space as a replacement for using call data for storage. Using call data to store cryptographic proofs of off-chain bundled transactions has been historically expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely. Proto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after a fixed period of 18 days. Polygon Labs\u2019 vice president of product, David Silverman, previously told Cointelegraph that the blog space is drastically cheaper for rollups and provides the same security guarantees. Ecosystem developers anticipate that there might be a delay in the realization of the fee reductions by layer-2s in the coming weeks as rollups carry out governance and upgrade procedures to change their contracts \u2014 moving from pointing to call data to point to the new blob space. The Starknet Foundation has announced a hard fork dedicated upgrade set to coincide with Dencun. Starknet version 0.13.1 will transition away from the \u201cexpensive\u201d call data method for sending data to Ethereum to the more cost-effective \u201cblobs\u201d transaction type, significantly reducing fees. The layer 2 expects to benefit significantly due to the fact that call data accounts for nearly 90% of the gas fees Starknet pays to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet. Related: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades StarkWare product manager and blockchain researcher Ilia Volokh tells Cointelegraph that Starknet\u2019s shared prover (SHARP), which sends Starknet\u2019s state diffs to Ethereum as call data, will shift to blob space. State diffs contain information about every contract storage that was updated and additional information on contract deployments. Volokh expects to see accurate statistics reflecting fee reduction within an hour of Dencun\u2019s implementation. Meanwhile, the full benefits will be immediately reflected to users, Volokh said: \u201cA byte of data will be priced in accordance with Ethereum\u2019s blob prices.\u201d Starknet\u2019s SHARP prover makes use of recursive proof technology that essentially bundles previous proofs into batches called trains. A new hash system introduced in early 2024 will allow the trains to increase the amount of transactions they can carry and ramp up the protocol\u2019s efficiency.

Blockchain gaming continues to be a major driver in the Web3 space, enjoying a 54% increase in average active users in early 2024. As the gaming ecosystem continues to look for ways to tap into the community-oriented environment of Web3 to explore new economic models, the complexity of tokenomics and the lack of an easy-to-use platform for Web3 game development become apparent. GAIMIN, a decentralized data processing network, recently introduced its Games Launcher platform to simplify game developers\u2019 migration to Web3 while incentivizing the community's engagement. Gamers can access the platform via PC or mobile apps to play Web3-friendly titles made by GAIMIN or a different developer, earning GMRX tokens \u2014the upcoming token of the GAIMIN ecosystem\u2014 or other in-game assets such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs), or as GAIMIN calls them, Digital Gaming Assets (DGAs), as part of their experience.

This article explains how to safely move one\u2019s Bitcoin holdings from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano X device. Transferring digital assets from an exchange-controlled environment to a personal storage device (self-custodial) where users can maintain control over their private keys is the process of migrating Bitcoin (BTC) from an exchange to a Ledger hardware wallet. Despite their ease of use, cryptocurrency exchanges fall short of the security and control offered by hardware wallets such as the Ledger Nano X. Exchanges are prone to hacking, putting assets at risk. In contrast, the Ledger Nano X protects cryptocurrencies offline from internet threats and gives users complete control over their private keys, which improves financial independence. Make sure the Ledger Nano X is running the latest firmware update before starting the migration. This is essential for security features and compatibility with the newest coins. To finish any available updates, Ledger Nano X has to be connected to a personal computer; open the Ledger Live program and follow the on-screen instructions. Install the applications for the coins you want to move using the Ledger Live program. Ledger Live is compatible with many digital assets; you must install the appropriate apps on your smartphone to manage these assets. You will receive a recovery phrase when you set up your Ledger Nano X. Keep this phrase safe since it is a backup key for all your cryptocurrency holdings. Write the recovery phrase on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere secure. Never input this phrase on any website or distribute it to anyone. Follow the steps below to connect the Coinbase Wallet to the Ledger device: Step 1: Download and install the Coinbase Wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store. Step 2: Launch the Coinbase Wallet extension. Step 3: Choose \u201cI already have a wallet\u201d if you have one; otherwise, select \u201cCreate new wallet.\u201d Step 4: Select \u201cConnect Ledger wallet\u201d to link your Coinbase Wallet. Step 5: The following window will display connected or paired devices. Select yours and click \u201cConnect now.\u201d Step 6: Sign the message to link the Ledger device to the Coinbase Wallet. Step 7: After signing the message, a popup saying \u201cYour device is ready\u201d will appear. Step 8: Open the extension to see your assets. Step 9: All the assets owned will be shown in the wallet. Follow the few easy steps to successfully migrate from Coinbase to Ledger Nano X. Visit Coinbase.com and sign in using your personal credentials. Locate the \u201cSend/Receive\u201d menu or \u201cPortfolio\u201d section on the Coinbase dashboard. This is usually at the top right corner of the interface. Click on the \u201cSend/Receive\u201d button, which will prompt a box to appear. In the \u201cSend\u201d tab, select the cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) you wish to transfer to your Ledger Nano X from the provided dropdown menu. Enter the amount of cryptocurrency you wish to transfer to your Ledger Nano X. Launch the Ledger Live application on your computer and navigate to the account linked to the cryptocurrency you want to transfer to your Ledger Nano X address. The Ledger wallet address will appear on the device screen when you select \u201cReceive\u201d and follow the on-screen instructions. You must ensure that the address displayed in the Ledger Live application matches the address shown on your device. Copy the address from Ledger Live and paste it into the Coinbase \u201cRecipient\u201d field after verifying it. You must also confirm the address is correct to avoid losing funds. Please note that creating a Ledger deposit address is now necessary. Coinbase often matches the address to the appropriate network automatically. However, users should confirm the appropriate network. Deposit addresses can be generated via the Ledger Live app without a Ledger device; however, these unverified addresses may lack security. Utilizing such addresses is done at the individual\u2019s own risk. Verify that all the information is correct before completing the transfer by carefully reviewing the transaction details, including the recipient\u2019s address and the amount of cryptocurrency. Coinbase might ask for further verification after you click the \u201cContinue\u201d button, like a 2-factor authentication code. After verifying everything, choose \u201cSend Now\u201d to transfer the cryptocurrency from your Coinbase account to your Ledger Nano X. The load on the blockchain network and the related transaction fees affect how long it takes for a transaction to be confirmed. The Ledger Live app and users\u2019 Coinbase accounts let them keep an eye on the transaction. Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, the transferred amount will be reflected in their Ledger Nano X account. Securing cryptocurrency involves more than just transferring assets to a Ledger Nano X; it also requires understanding and adhering to best practices for hardware wallet security. Following a successful cryptocurrency transfer from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano X, immediate steps should be taken to secure the holdings. The protection of these investments largely depends on the digital security practices employed and the physical safeguarding of the Ledger device. One should treat their Ledger Nano X as they would a significant amount of cash or a valuable piece of jewelry, storing it securely in a locked safe or drawer. Despite the device\u2019s PIN protection, restricting physical access adds an extra layer of security. Ledger constantly aims to improve the security and functionality of its devices through firmware updates. Owners should frequently connect their Ledger Nano X to the Ledger Live software to perform these updates. Additionally, updating each cryptocurrency app on the device ensures access to the latest features and security enhancements. The importance of the recovery phrase cannot be overstated. This 24-word phrase is crucial for accessing cryptocurrency holdings and can restore accounts on a new device if the original Ledger device is lost, stolen or damaged. Storing this phrase in a secure location, such as a fireproof safe, and considering a durable backup solution like the Ledger Cryptosteel, is advisable. One should always double-check addresses before confirming transactions and remain vigilant against phishing attempts. Remember, Ledger will never request one\u2019s 24-word recovery phrase. Users should also familiarize themselves with common scams and phishing tactics in the crypto space, which is essential to avoid falling prey to them. Ensuring network compatibility between the exchange and the Ledger Nano X poses a common challenge during the migration of cryptocurrency, especially with multi-blockchain currencies like Tether (USDT). It\u2019s crucial to select the correct network on both Coinbase and Ledger to prevent asset loss during transfers. Additionally, blockchain congestion can lead to transaction delays, where patience becomes vital. Instead of resending the transaction immediately, monitoring its progress through blockchain explorers may prevent transactions from getting stuck twice. Overcoming these challenges not only smooths the migration process but also secures the digital assets when transferred from Coinbase to Ledger Nano X. By migrating cryptocurrency from an exchange to a Ledger Nano X, individuals can ensure the long-term security of their assets. Being informed about the migration process, addressing potential challenges and employing strategies to maximize security is essential. It\u2019s important to remember that securing cryptocurrency is an ongoing process that demands vigilance, education and adaptability to new threats and technological changes.","tags":"#Blockchain, #Coinbase, #Wallet, #Transactions, #Ledger, #Cryptocurrency Exchange, #How to"},{"date":"Mar 12, 2024","summary":"","author":"Helen Partz","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/binance-tigran-gambaryan-detained-nigeria","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Binance execs detained in Nigerian capital despite country exit","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Despite Binance announcing its exit from Nigeria last week, two of its senior executives are reportedly still being detained in the country's capital, Abuja. Tigran Gambaryan, a former cryptocurrency-focused United States federal agent, and a second Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, have been held in Abuja without passports for two weeks, Wired reported on March 12. Gambaryan, head of Binance\u2019s criminal investigations team, and Anjarwalla, Binance Kenya-based regional manager for Africa, have been detained at a government property since Feb. 26, 2024. According to Gambaryan and Anjarwalla\u2019s families, Nigerian prosecutors have not provided information on whether the two face criminal charges. \u201cThere\u2019s no definite answer for anything: how he\u2019s doing, what\u2019s going to happen to him, when he\u2019s coming back,\u201d Gambaryan\u2019s wife, Yuki Gambaryan, reportedly said. A spokesperson for Binance confirmed to Cointelegraph that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were still detained in Nigeria as of March 12, stating: \u201cWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time, we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families.\u201d The Binance representative stressed that both execs are \u201cprofessionals with the highest integrity\u201d and that the exchange is confident that there will be a swift resolution to this matter. The first reports on the arrests of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla surfaced in late February, with the Financial Times reporting on the detentions without identifying them on Feb. 28. Gambaryan, a United States citizen, and Anjarwalla, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Kenya, reportedly arrived in Abuja on Feb. 25, according to their families. The execs came to Nigeria following the Nigerian government\u2019s invitation to address the ongoing dispute with Binance regarding its allegedly unlawful operations there. The execs reportedly met with Nigerian officials the next day, intending to discuss the government\u2019s order to the country\u2019s telecom providers to block access to Binance and other crypto exchanges. The officials blamed crypto exchanges for devaluing Nigeria\u2019s official currency, the naira, and enabling \u201cillicit flows\u201d of funds. But instead of finding common ground regarding the argument, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were taken to their hotels soon after the first meeting, ordered to pack their things and brought to a \u201cguesthouse\u201d run by Nigeria\u2019s National Security Agency, according to their families. Officials also seized their passports and have since held the two men at the house against their will, it is alleged. Related: Binance exit sparks fears and opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s crypto community According to Wired, Gambaryan has been visited by a U.S. State Department official and Anjarwalla by a representative of the U.K. Foreign Office. Nigerian government guards have remained present in those meetings, preventing them from speaking privately. The arrests of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla came a few days before Binance officially announced its complete exit from Nigeria on March 5. According to the company\u2019s exit roadmap, Binance suspended naira withdrawals on March 8 and removed all trading pairs involving the naira on March 7. The platform also previously disabled peer-to-peer trading with the naira in late February. Magazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

At its intraday best, the cryptocurrency was trading for as high as $0.74, its highest level since November 2023. Let's discuss the core factors contributing to the XRP price rally today. XRP's price gains today appear after massive capital transfers from crypto exchanges. Notably, on March 8, an anonymous entity withdrew 300 million XRP worth over $187.13 million from Binance, according to data resource Whale Alert. Similar outbound transactions worth $18-19 million occurred afterward, indicating that XRP's richest investors want to hold their tokens instead of trading them on exchanges for other assets. That is further visible in the whale data from Messari. It shows that the number of addresses with a balance of over 1 million XRP has increased during the ongoing price rally. This data suggests that large crypto investors are behind the current XRP price gains, which typically bodes well for more upside. In addition, XRP\u2019s price gain today appears alongside a sharp rebound versus Bitcoin (BTC) as well. Related: XRP has disappointed vs. Bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 Is a price rebound possible? Notably, the XRP/BTC pair has jumped by over 12% a day after dropping to 0.00000859 BTC, its lowest level since March 2021. This rebound shows some risk-on traders rotating from Bitcoin and into altcoins for greater profit potential in the short term. Traders also rotate capital to reduce their risk exposure in overbought assets. Bitcoin, despite its 72.5% rise so far in 2024, remains \"overbought\" on the daily timeframe chart. In comparison, XRP\u2019s daily relative strength index (RSI) remains within the neutral range of 30-70, demonstrating a balanced sentiment among investors. This technically indicates that XRP could have more room to rise against the rally-leading BTC. From a technical analysis perspective, XRP's price gains have emerged out of a support confluence area. This confluence comprises XRP\u2019s ascending trendline, 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMAl the blue wave) at $0.58, and 0.382 Fibonacci retracement line near $0.59. These support levels resemble a fractal in November 2023 that preceded a 21.25% price rally. So XRP price will eye a close above the multi-year descending trendline resistance to sustain its uptrend toward its popular target of $1. Conversely, a routine pullback from the resistance might resulting a drop of 20% toward its ascending trendline support near $0.50. In this bearish scenario, the downside target is near XRP's 50-week (the red wave) and 20-week (the blue wave) EMAs. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The blockchain world is booming, but Ethereum, one of the most popular networks for decentralized applications, faces a scalability challenge. Fabrega encourages listeners to think of the network as a super secure highway where traffic builds during peak hours \u2014 like during the launch of a popular nonfungible token project. Transactions can take minutes to complete and cost users substantial fees, sometimes 10s or even hundreds of dollars. This hinders the user experience and limits the network\u2019s ability to handle the ever-growing demand for real-world applications. To address Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges, developers have created layer-2 solutions. These solutions can be considered \u201cnew lanes\u201d on the Ethereum highway for collective vehicles. On Metis, transactions are bundled together and processed quickly and cheaply without compromising the security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. Layer-2 solutions like Metis take transactions off the main Ethereum network, decongesting it and allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. While L2s already exist, Metis tries to level up by focusing on scalability and prioritizing decentralization, meaning a robust network less prone to censorship and downtime. Many existing layer-2 solutions prioritize speed and cost reduction, though these often come at the expense of some degree of decentralization. Decentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology, which ensures that no single entity controls the network, creating an environment more resistant to censorship and manipulation. A genuinely decentralized layer-2 solution would inherit these benefits from the underlying Ethereum blockchain while also offering scalability. If successful, Metis can solve the scalability blockchain trilemma and contribute to a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem. To learn more about Metis and how it could revolutionize the future of blockchain technology, listen to the full episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or your podcast platform of choice.

Should the trend continue, however, a new phenomenon could arise where there will not be enough BTC available to meet demand. \u201cBears can\u2019t win this game until spot Bitcoin ETF inflow stops,\u201d Ki summarized. He noted that ETFs alone put away more than 30,000 BTC last week, and with 3 million BTC in exchange and miner wallets, the odds of a supply-induced price shock become clear. \u201cLast week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC.

In a U.S. Department of the Treasury document titled \u201cGeneral Explanations of the Administration\u2019s Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals,\u201d the administration highlighted that current laws do not address digital assets apart from broker and cash transaction reporting. Because of this, the administration wants to impose an excise tax \u2014 taxes levied on goods like fuel \u2014 on digital asset mining. The Treasury wrote: \u201cAny firm using computing resources, whether owned by the firm or leased from others, to mine digital assets would be subject to an excise tax equal to 30 percent of the costs of electricity used in digital asset mining.\u201d If implemented, crypto mining companies must report the amount and type of electricity they use. In addition, firms must report the value of the electricity used if they purchase it externally. Meanwhile, Miners who lease computational capacity would be mandated to report the value of the electricity of the company that leased them the capacity. The value would then serve as the tax base. According to the administration, this proposal would be effective for taxable years after Dec. 31, 2024. The government will introduce the tax in three phases: 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year and 30% in the third year. The tax would also apply to crypto mining firms that generate their own electricity. Companies that produce or acquire power \u201coff-grid\u201d would also need to pay a 30% tax on the estimated costs of their electricity bills. Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Bitcoin mining infrastructure firm Riot Platforms, highlighted that even those using solar or wind power would be affected. Rochard believes this is a ploy to suppress Bitcoin (BTC) and launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Related: Texas Blockchain Council and Riot secure win against US energy officials Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis voiced opposition to the tax proposal on X. According to Lummis, while the inclusion of crypto on the budget shows that the administration may be bullish on crypto, a 30% tax would destroy the industry\u2019s foothold in the United States. This is not the first time the Biden administration has tried implementing a 30% tax on electricity used by crypto miners. On March 9, 2023, Biden made the same attempt to tax miners in the budget proposal for 2024.

According to a March 11 post from CoinShares analyst James Butterfill, crypto investment products generated a record-breaking $2.7 billion worth of inflows as of March 8. Year-to-date crypto ETPs have generated $10.3 billion worth of inflows, which is already nearly on par with the total $10.6 billion worth of inflows crypto ETPs witnessed throughout the whole of 2021. Bitcoin accounted for the lion\u2019s share of this figure, seeing $2.6 billion in inflows year-to-date and currently representing 14% of the total crypto-related assets under management (AUM) worldwide. Days later, on March 11, the price of Bitcoin rallied to reach a new all-time high of $72,900. The asset has since leveled out and is changing hands for around $72,000, up 6.9% in the last week and 29% over the last month, per TradingView data. Inflows into crypto ETPs have been spurred significantly by growing investment into the roster of recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which have now seen over $110 billion in total volume traded since their inception on Jan. 11. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that a total of five U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now held over $2 billion assets under management (AUM), with crypto-native asset manager Bitwise\u2019s BITB fund being the most recent addition to the club. \u201cOut of ~3,500 US ETPs there are only 445 with over $2 billion in assets,\u201d Seyffart added. In an analyst note viewed by Cointelegraph, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore predicted that the current rally could see Bitcoin\u2019s price push toward $80,000 in the coming months, adding that the crypto asset would be \u201cwell supported\u201d on any potential dips.

However, only institutional investors and \u201cultra-high-net-worth individuals\u201d will be able to invest in these private Bitcoin ETF funds, according to a March 12 report from the Bangkok Post. Previously, regulations that govern investments of asset management firms did not cover digital asset ETFs, and under the SEC Act, asset managers are only permitted to provide trading of assets classified as securities. However, after the United States securities regulator approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, shares in spot Bitcoin ETFs became defined as securities rather than crypto assets under Thai regulations. SEC secretary-general Pornanong Budsaratragoon said the regulator will permit only accredited investors to have access to Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) due to their high-risk nature. \u201cAsset management firms asked the SEC for them to have exposure in digital assets, especially Bitcoin and spot Bitcoin ETFs, but we need to consider carefully whether to allow asset management firms to invest in digital assets directly due to the high risk,\u201d she told the Bangkok Post. In January, the Thailand SEC reportedly said it would not allow asset management firms to launch their own version of spot Bitcoin ETFs within the country. However, the latest rules have left out the prospect of retail investors getting exposure to the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Retail crypto trading remains popular in Thailand, but its usage remains restricted. Using digital assets for payments was outlawed by the government in March 2022, and the SEC banned the use of cryptocurrencies for lending and investment in July 2023.

El Salvador\u2019s crypto treasury is now $85 million in profit, according to the Nayib Bukele Portfolio Tracker website, with BTC prices hitting a new all-time high above $72,000 on March 11. The Central American nation began buying BTC in September 2021 when it made the asset legal tender in the country. At the time of that first 200-coin purchase, Bitcoin was trading for $51,769. Bukele\u2019s strategy had been called into question, however, after Bitcoin fell from a peak of $69,000 in November 2021 and then tanked to as low as $16,000 in the bear market that followed, plunging the portfolio deep into the red. Nevertheless, it broke even again when BTC prices crossed the dollar cost average of $42,600 in February and has now surged into profit. The entire portfolio, which contains 2,861 BTC, is currently worth $207.3 million. On March 12, President Bukele commented that in addition to the profit, there was also Bitcoin revenue from the country\u2019s passport program, revenue from converting BTC to United States dollars for local businesses, revenue from BTC mining and revenue from government services. In December, El Salvador approved a migration law granting expedited citizenship to foreigners who make Bitcoin donations toward government social and economic development programs.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there were more than a few reasons he\u2019s now downgraded the chances of Ether ETF approval to just 35%. \u201cThe main thing is the fact that we\u2019re 73 days from the final deadline, and there\u2019s been no contact or comments from the SEC to the issuers. That\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cThe SEC has to give comments and the issuers have to work on correcting them. They may have to refile and they might even want to have a couple of meetings \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a long process,\u201d said Balchunas. He added that he\u2019d also sourced \u201cgood intel\u201d to suggest that the SEC may be giving the silent treatment to prospective fund issuers on purpose. Balchunas also said SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s stance on Ether could also play a part, arguing that Gensler still thinks of Ether as a security and may be unwilling to endure another round of the \u201cpolitical blowback\u201d he received following the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the SEC\u2019s court loss to Grayscale in August 2023. \u201cI also feel like he feels like he threw the industry a bone. He ate crow with the court loss, and from his perspective, it\u2019s like: \u2018All right, you should be satisfied now,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, Gensler thinks Ether is a security. He would not want to approve it unless he thought it to be a commodity like Bitcoin. All of this little stuff adds up.\u201d Balchunas said the ETF process for Ether feels like the \u201creverse\u201d of what he\u2019d experienced during the spot Bitcoin ETF race. While he conceded that this was a personal judgment, or \u201csixth sense,\u201d didn\u2019t form a big part of the calculus behind his odds for the ETF approval, he described it as being an important guiding factor nonetheless. \u201cThis just feels different to the Bitcoin ETF race. Whether it was our sourcing, actual public documentation, or just our gut instinct, it all kind of grew and got more bullish. Everything fed on each other as a positive. And so, our odds naturally went up. This feels like the reverse.\u201d In a March 11 post to X, ETF Store president Nate Geraci noted that it was strange the SEC would approve several ETH futures ETF products in October and then not approve spot products in May, adding there was very little explanation for why that would be the case. Meanwhile, Matt Corva, general counsel at Consensys, said in a March 11 post on X that an ETH ETF denial could be a positive development in the long term. \u201cIf ETH goes, they get crushed by their political handlers and they have no arbitrary ground left to battle against other coins \u2014 this is a great thing,\u201d Corva said. Related: Ethereum price (ETH) hits $4,000 for the first time since 2021 On March 6, crypto exchange giant Coinbase and asset manager Grayscale met with SEC officials to discuss a rule change to launch spot Ether exchange-traded funds. While many crypto industry pundits considered this to be a positive sign for an Ether ETF approval, Balchunas looked to a \u201cstrong\u201d thesis from VB Capital general partner Scott Johnsson as the best explanation for why that may not be the case. Johnsson pointed out that the meeting wasn\u2019t between prospective fund issuers and was largely focused on analytics of the correlation between the prices of ETH and BTC futures compared to spot. The correlation analysis could be used as grounds to approve or deny the ETF, although denial seemed more likely to Johnsson \u2014 something that Balchunas agreed with. If the SEC were to reject all of the pending Ethereum ETF applications outright, Balchunas said the next most important date to watch would be Tuesday, Nov. 5, the day of the U.S. presidential election. \u201cEven if Biden wins, sometimes they switch up people running things, which means Gensler could move. If Trump wins, that will change a lot,\u201d said Balchunas. \u201cThat\u2019s my reasoning behind the election being the day to watch.\u201d Ultimately, Blachunas was confident that a spot Ether ETF was more a matter of when, not if, and asserted that an approval would almost certainly happen eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to nail down when, but the more time that goes by, the more this stuff gets worked out.\u201d Magazine: \u2018Crypto is inevitable\u2019 so we went \u2018all in\u2019 \u2014 Meet Vance Spencer, permabull","tags":"#Cryptocurrencies, #Business, #Ethereum, #SEC, #ETF, #Adoption, #United States, #Ether Price, #Ethereum Price"},{"date":"Mar 12, 2024","summary":"","author":"Jesse Coghlan","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/sec-crypto-rulemaking-petition-appeal-coinbase","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"SEC\u2019s reason for refusing crypto rulemaking \u2018does not cut it,\u2019 says Coinbase","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Crypto exchange Coinbase has continued its legal fight against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, asking a court to force the agency to \u201cbegin a long-overdue\u201d process to make rules for the crypto industry. In a March 11 opening brief in the Third Circuit Appeals Court, Coinbase claimed the SEC broke the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) \u2014 governing how agencies can make regulations \u2014 when it denied the exchange\u2019s July 2022 petition asking the SEC to make crypto rules and didn\u2019t give a sufficient reason as to why. Coinbase said the regulator\u2019s reason for the rulemaking refusal \u2014 where SEC Chair Gary Gensler disagreed that existing securities laws were unworkable with crypto \u2014 \u201cdoes not cut it,\u201d and it needs to \u201cprovide a reasoned justification for refusing to engage in rulemaking.\u201d The denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d as the SEC failed to explain how securities laws apply to crypto while it \u201c[enforced] those rules aggressively\u201d by suing multiple crypto companies for securities laws violations, Coinbase claimed. Coinbase asked the court to grant its petition for review, rebuff the SEC\u2019s denial and force the regulation to begin the rulemaking process. In an accompanying March 11 X post, Coinbase legal chief Paul Grewal wrote that if the SEC \u201cbelieves it can lawfully assert new authority over digital assets today (it can\u2019t), it must explain why in a rulemaking process and give the public a chance to understand and challenge that view.\u201d Coinbase\u2019s 78-page brief also claims the SEC \u201cabruptly changed positions\u201d when it comes to crypto. In the past, the SEC said it had \u201climited authority\u201d over crypto and there was a legal \u201clack of clarity,\u201d but later, the agency said it had enough authority to police crypto, Coinbase claimed. The exchange alleged the SEC didn\u2019t have the power to change tact as it needed approval from Congress \u2014 which Coinbase, Kraken, Binance and others have argued in motions to dismiss SEC lawsuits against them. Related: Grayscale, Coinbase sit down with SEC over spot Ether ETF \u201cIf the SEC insists on plowing ahead without congressional authorization, that decision must be made and implemented through prospective rulemaking,\u201d Coinbase wrote. Coinbase\u2019s appeal against the SEC\u2019s rulemaking denial is a separate court biff from the SEC\u2019s June 2023 lawsuit against Coinbase which alleged it operated as an unlicensed exchange and offered unregistered securities. In January, Coinbase and the SEC held oral arguments over the exchange\u2019s dismissal motion in that case \u2014 which used much of the same claims it\u2019s made in this one, that the SEC has no authority over crypto exchanges unless Congress says so.

In fact, the number of new daily Bitcoin millionaires now is similar to figures from July 2022, when Bitcoin plummeted below $20,000. Kaiko attributed the \u201cslow return\u201d of new daily Bitcoin millionaire wallets to new capital not yet being deployed in \u201cfull force\u201d and large whales potentially taking profits as Bitcoin hit new highs. \u201cIn 2021, there was a huge influx in capital as all manner of bull sought to benefit from the crypto hype. This time around, whales could be taking a more cautious approach, waiting to see if the gains have legs before investing.\u201d Kaiko also said there could be more whales storing their holdings with custodians as opposed to personal wallets. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may have played a role here, as the nine new United States-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated more than $28 billion worth of Bitcoin since the ETFs launched in January, according to March 8 data from BitMEX Research. Coinbase and BitGo are among the main custodians of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Rather than holding Bitcoin directly, investors in spot Bitcoin ETFs hold shares in the ETFs, which would mean their indirect Bitcoin holdings would not be reflected in this whale wallet data.

It\u2019s also a key force for mass adoption. Yet, the journey towards fully realizing the potential of Web3 gaming is fraught with challenges, notably the seamless integration of on-chain elements without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and player empowerment. New users should only experience friction if necessary, and as late as possible. That\u2019s not the case with most existing Web3 games. From connecting their wallets upfront to signing transactions for verification, users face multiple hurdles before actually trying the game. These frictions contrast starkly with the vision of a seamless and accessible gaming world that fully on-chain gaming aspires to achieve. Titles such as Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, though groundbreaking, fall short of being fully on-chain. Fully on-chain games store all game assets, mechanics, and states on the blockchain. This radical approach ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and player control, allowing for a truly decentralized gaming experience where players own and shape their digital destinies. Related: Axie Infinity is toxic for crypto gaming Building the best game demands a functional, efficient combination of on-chain elements and the rich user experience of legacy titles. Holding Web3 games to Web2 standards is comparing apples to oranges. Their requirements, value propositions, and scopes differ greatly despite serving similar audiences. Web3 games are meant to solve age-old problems like top-down models, lack of user control, and strong-arming by gaming corporations. That\u2019ll happen only by implementing alternative models, processes, and principles \u2014 not by emulating the outcomes achieved in Web2. We can even argue that terms like \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cseamless,\u201d and \u201chassle-free,\u201d will take on new meanings in this context, enhanced by other aspects like community orientation, real in-game value, and user-generated logic. Therefore, when building Web3 games, the most crucial requirement is to address novel challenges, ideally involving embracing innovative technologies and models that align with the principles of autonomy and community governance. It\u2019s about building \u201cAutonomous Worlds\u201d (AWs), a concept introduced in 2022 by Ludens \u2014 the founder of Lattice.xyz \u2014 to describe \u201ca world with a blockchain substrate.\u201d Moreover, new-age games must nurture and serve the expanding community of problem-aware gamers. Those who seek genuine solutions to the odds stacked against them in legacy gaming. Not mere bounty hunters and fleeting profit-mongers. Ironically, Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties served as pivotal catalysts in the evolution of blockchain gaming \u2014 but they weren't fully on-chain. They were experimental, niche, and heavily crypto-centric, characterized by their clunky user interfaces. Despite opening up new avenues, they weren\u2019t entirely \"Autonomous Worlds\" either. Users had little or no control over the rules and direction of the game, and only parts of the game states were on-chain. need help my ship is stuck in the ‚ñëF‚ñëO‚ñëG‚ñë pic.twitter.com/Hn6jn3NTOK \u2014 The Citadel (@0xCitadel) March 6, 2024 Dark Forest was the first decentralized real-time strategy game, released in 2020. Using zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs), a cryptographic protocol, to create a \u201cfog of war\u201d in the gaming experience, this project set an example in building incomplete information games on-chain. For reference, think of games like poker, where players only see their hands and don\u2019t know what cards others have. The challenge Dark Forest tackled was maintaining a publicly accessible distributed ledger without compromising the confidentiality of players' strategies \u2014 a fundamental aspect in any strategic gameplay. Using zkProofs, Dark Forest maintained gameplay integrity and player privacy on a blockchain. This approach solved the critical issue of revealing sensitive game states (e.g., planet locations or attack trajectories), which is easily manageable with centralized servers but very challenging in decentralized environments. Dark Forest's solution set a precedent for real-time strategy gaming on the blockchain, providing a blueprint for future on-chain game development. They even sparked the proliferation of community-oriented, bottom-up AWs: Mithraeum, Citadel, ZkHunt, and so on. Loot Project was another interesting addition to this space, letting users permissionlessly expand the IP and spawning hundreds of games, lores, etc. By putting everything on-chain \u2014 from game states (assets, actions, etc.) to logic (rules of introduction, mechanisms for in-game interactions, etc.), AWs unlock flexible and resilient digital realities where users come of their own. Going beyond in-game asset ownership, they incentivize players to attach greater significance to their on-chain gaming activities. More importantly, on-chain logic provides gamers with a meaningful say in what\u2019s legitimate and what\u2019s not in the game-world. This is a massive departure from the status quo, where end-users are mostly passive consumers, playing at the whims and mercy of corporate publishers. Rules and norms emerge via community consensus, not the arbitrary will of external entities. And they serve grassroots interests. Players can build, contribute, monetize, and participate in ways that are impossible in Web2 games. Related: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs The empowering, skin-in-the-game nature of AWs instills a stronger desire for mastery in gamers. They\u2019re more driven to find creative solutions to solve problems and create mods and plugins to establish entirely separate economies within the game. This participatory fosters a deeper connection to the game, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration within the community. For example, Dark Forest players have built a range of bots, plugins, and custom clients they can use to climb a leaderboard.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC rose from an opening at $69,032, soaring 5.7% to set a new year-to-date high of $72,850 on Monday, March 11. This remarkable performance from Bitcoin has led to concerns regarding a sell-off triggered by profit-booking at higher levels. Here are three technical and market indicators that point to a possible BTC price correction in the short-term Independent analyst Ali spotted BTC price trading above $71,700, warning short-term traders that a reversal could be in the offing. Ali posted the following chart showing that the TD sequential indicator had sent a sell signal in BTC\u2019s 12-hour chart. \u201cSince early February, every time this indicator suggested selling, the price of $BTC dropped by 1.6% to 3.5%. This trend is something short-term traders should watch closely!\u201d The TD sequential indicator is an oscillating trend-following chart overlay indicator that is used to determine short-term trend reversals based on changes in intraday highs and lows. In this case, the indicator predicts that the BTC price could drop from the current level, dropping as much as 3.5%, to trade around $70,000. Bitcoin price has been on an \u201cup only\u201d trend since Jan. 23, after the \u201csell-the-news\u201d effect of spot Bitcoin ETFs faded. These new BTC investment funds have seen massive capital inflows since their debut on Jan. 11, with assets under management reaching $55.3 billion on March 11. This has led to the appearance of \u201coverheated signals\u201d in the Bitcoin market. Analysts at CryptoQuant are warning that BTC could experience major corrections soon despite exploring new all-time highs. On March 8, the blockchain analytics firm posted a series of posts on the X social network showing some metrics supporting \u201cpotential overheating.\u201d The firm mentioned another metric showing miners being overpaid as realized profits reached the highest levels since December 2023. \u201cMiners are now deemed extremely overpaid, with profitability hitting its highest level since December 2023.\u201d CryptoQuant also highlighted that traders\u2019 unrealized profit margins had reached 57%, which is historically associated with upcoming corrections as traders are bound to book profits in the long run. \u201cAdditionally, short-term holders have begun selling at the highest profit margins since February 2021, potentially heralding increased selling pressure,\u201d added CryptoQuant.

Coinglass\u2018s heatmap shows that BTC\u2019s RSI is displaying overbought conditions in four out of five timeframes. Higher intervals display higher RSI values. Bitcoin\u2019s RSI is now at 88.34 on the weekly, 79.34 on the daily, 74.81 on the four-hour, and 70.74 on the hourly timeframe. This is corroborated by data from TradingView, which shows BTC\u2019s RSI at 89.2, 79, 72 and 70 on weekly, daily, 12-hour and four-hour timeframes, respectively. Overbought conditions generally describe recent movements in the price of an asset, and reflect an expectation that the price trend may correct in the near future. Additional data from Alternative, a platform that tracks \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d surrounding Bitcoin, showed that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 82 - \u201cextreme greed\u201d conditions. Alternative notes, \u201cWhen investors get too greedy, the market is due for a correction. Note that the last time this index was above 80 was at the height of the 2021 bull market, just before BTC dropped down from its then-all-time high of around $69,000 and tumbled toward $15,000 during the 2022 bear market. Even though these metrics are cautioning market participants to manage risks, it is important to note that RSI conditions do not guarantee a trend reversal. Crypto prices are highly volatile, and BTC could continue to rally, fueled by increasing demand and the upcoming supply halving. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The United States is already at risk, Hill said, and the FDIC shares the blame for that. Tokenization of bank deposits and other real-world assets (RWA) could make it possible to carry out financial transaction at any time with real-time settlement, Hill said. In addition, it would provide programmability of payments, making it possible to conduct intraday repurchase (repo) exchanges and improve settlement times for some bond issuances and numerous other transactions. Consumers could also benefit from using programmable payments in place of escrow. Among the many open questions about tokenization, Hill mentioned the use, or not, of unified ledgers, blockchain interoperability and ownership rights as assets move along the blockchain. Furthermore: \u201cGlobal standards are being established, directly or indirectly, and with many non-U.S. jurisdictions actively engaged in this area, the United States risks ceding influence at this critical stage.\u201d Programmability could reduce settlement risks and Know Your Customer processes, but it could also allow consumers to move their assets quickly, aggravating bank runs. An \u201coff\u201d switch is needed to prevent that, Hill said. Regulatory agencies attempted in the past to set consistent policies with little luck, so \u201cinstead, the agencies established processes under which institutions must engage with their regulator on an individual basis,\u201d Hill said. Related: Inspector General wants FDIC to refine crypto risk assessment process, guidance Looking at FDIC regulations, which treat all transactions on a blockchain \u2014 whether they involve RWA or crypto \u2014 the same, Hill found them to be cumbersome and unequally applied: \u201cInstitutions have spent months responding to a long stream of information requests, diverting attention away from developing new technologies and systems.

The rally has seen significant volatility, highlighted by a 4.8% intraday rise to $70,055 on March 8, followed by a 5.9% dip to $65,935. As a result, Bitcoin bulls are wary of celebrating this new all-time high, particularly due to the surge in leverage demand through BTC futures contracts. Analysts have pointed out that the $35.8 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest poses a risk, as traders often over-rely on leveraged positions. This data confirms investors' interest, but it cannot be deemed inherently bullish because futures longs (buyers) and sellers (shorts) are matched at all times. This situation creates volatility rather than directional bias. It is also worth mentioning that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) presently holds the largest share in Bitcoin futures, surpassing traditional crypto exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX. However, this was not the case in November 2021 when Bitcoin futures open interest last peaked as BTC traded near $69,000, subsequently experiencing a 31.5% decline in just 30 days. When this figure is expressed in BTC, the Bitcoin open interest remains 27% below its October 2022 peak. Yet, the current 495,380 BTC in futures open interest is substantial enough to trigger sharp volatility spikes as Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuates. This was evident on March 4, when a staggering $325 million in leveraged BTC long and short positions were liquidated. Assessing whether leverage demand is predominantly toward buying requires an examination of Bitcoin's futures monthly contracts. These contracts usually trade at a slight premium over the spot markets, as sellers ask for more money to postpone settlement. Typically, BTC futures should trade at an annualized premium of 5 to 10% \u2014 a condition known as contango, which is common across financial markets. Recent data indicates a surge in demand for leveraged BTC long positions, with the premium breaking the 10% neutral mark four weeks ago. The premium recently peaked at 23%, the highest in over 18 months, with the current 21% level often reflecting excessive optimism. However, considering Bitcoin\u2019s 40% price surge in the last two weeks, it's too soon to consider the current futures premium as unsustainable, especially when past bull markets have seen premiums exceed 45%. On March 11, the funding rate for Bitcoin futures perpetual contracts reached 2.1% per week, marking a peak unseen in over 18 months. Retail traders often prefer these contracts for their close tracking of the spot market prices, yet they come with a twist: a variable leverage fee, known as the funding rate. In essence, a positive rate suggests that traders are leaning more heavily on leverage for their long positions. Related: Bitcoin breaches $71K for the first time Bitcoin bulls have the advantage of strong inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and Microstrategy keeps on buying more Bitcoin, undeterred by the soaring prices. But, if retail traders jump on the bandwagon and start pouring into these pricey perpetual contracts at $72,000, there's a good chance market makers and arbitrage desks will stir up some volatility to cash in on those over-leveraged positions. While a few big players can't really push Bitcoin's price down for the long haul, the reality of investors paying a 2.1% fee every week to maintain bullish bets brings a real risk of a domino effect of liquidations if there's a price dip. That said, with steady ETF inflows, it seems a bit off to predict a major price drop based just on the leverage scenario. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In the March 11 announcement, the Bank of Israel outlined that its shekel CBDC will be implemented in a two-tier model, with instant, 24/7 payments, multipayment support, offline use, limitations on balances and an option for the CBDC to become interest-bearing. The central bank wrote: \u201cIn the area of privacy, the architecture will allow the central bank, as the system administrator, to define the types of information required for the operation, control, and monitoring of the system. However, the central bank will not have access to personally identifiable information about end users\u2019 balances and transactions.\u201d Currently, commercial banks in Israel pay 4.86% interest on customers\u2019 fiat shekel deposits and savings.

In April 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the country\u2019s central bank could issue a shekel CBDC if stablecoin use increases. \u201cAt this point, there are no signs of substantial adoption of stablecoins as means of payment in Israel,\u201d the central bank said at the time.

Binance.US continues to grapple with ongoing legal challenges, particularly in the United States. The exchange has already had a \u201cnear-mortal blow\u201d after a June 2023 lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), forcing it to terminate over 200 staff as revenues \u201cimploded,\u201d according to its chief operating officer Christopher Blodgett. Now, the SEC alleges the company is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to answer requests for information concerning the custody of customer assets. The regulator has asked the court to intervene to speed up the discovery process. Central to the SEC\u2019s investigation is whether employees of the non-U.S. arm of Binance maintained access to Binance.US customer assets. The SEC claimed Binance.US has failed to prove that it didn\u2019t have access to private keys or other forms of access to customer assets. In the report, Binance.US pushed back on the SEC\u2019s allegations, saying it had complied with the regulator\u2019s \u201cexceptionally broad\u201d requests for information and asked the court to end the expedited discovery process. Meanwhile, a U.S. appeals court overturned a ruling that dismissed a class-action lawsuit led by investors against Binance. Chase Williams filed the lawsuit in April 2020 on behalf of investors in a similar situation, arguing that Binance allegedly contracted to sell securities without being registered as a securities exchange or broker-dealer. The district court dismissed the lawsuit, citing the investors\u2019 claims as untimely according to the relevant statute of limitations. However, the appeals court agrees with the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Binance is subject to domestic securities laws and that their initial filing was timely. The saga of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon continues to unfold, with a court in Montenegro again overruling a lower court decision to extradite Kwon to the United States.

The appellate court panel argued that the high court\u2019s previous order to extradite Kwon to the U.S. was affected by \u201csignificant violations of the provisions of criminal procedure\u201d of the local laws. The latest decision by the Appellate Court of Montenegro marks another event in the long history of Kwon\u2019s extradition process after he was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023.

An initial public offering (IPO) is under consideration, he said. Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai founded Telegram in 2013. Pavel Durov is now the sole owner of the company, according to the Financial Times. He told the newspaper on March 11: \u201cWe are hoping to become profitable next year, if not this year.\u201d Durov said the company has \u201cstarted to monetise,\u201d and \u201cwe see value in [an IPO] as a means to democratise access to Telegram\u2019s value.\u201d This comes despite offers from investors at \u201c$30bn-plus valuations.\u201d The newspaper wrote that two unnamed sources had told it that Telegram would probably seek a listing in the United States once the company becomes profitable.

Durov also told the newspaper that Telegram would consider following the lead of Reddit by offering \u201cloyal\u201d users shares during the IPO as well. Reddit announced in a filing submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 11 that it hoped to raise $519 million in an IPO, and its investors would sell another 6.7 million shares for a total fundraise of $748 million.

While these platforms initially offered promising paths to exposure, the reality has fallen short, leaving artists struggling to secure fair compensation in terms of royalties and control over their work. The issue lies in the way streaming services distribute revenue: a meager portion reaches the artists themselves, with record labels often negotiating significantly higher payouts than indie musicians for their work. Spotify\u2019s reported payout per stream further exemplifies this disparity, falling within a paltry range of $0.003 to $0.005 in 2024. Adding insult to injury, Spotify\u2019s recent policy change throws another obstacle in the path of indie artists. In 2024, the platform will cease royalties for tracks receiving fewer than 1,000 streams within a year. While technicalities suggest these tracks will still accrue royalties, the funds will be funneled upward, often benefiting bigger artists. This 1,000-stream cliff creates a significant barrier for indie musicians attempting to break through and build a fanbase. One stat you won\u2019t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform. The max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform. pic.twitter.com/OCMHsHNce5 \u2014 United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) November 29, 2023 Another major challenge for indie artists is building a loyal fanbase. The current market is saturated with countless independent artists vying for attention. Building a personal brand and effectively utilizing social media platforms can help indie musicians connect with their audience and cultivate a fanbase, but it takes time, money and effort to make it big. This is where Web3, particularly nonfungible tokens (NFTs), emerges as a solution with the potential to transform the indie music industry. Music NFTs allow artists to sell songs, albums or exclusive digital content directly to their fans. The NFT approach bypasses intermediaries like record labels and streaming platforms, allowing artists to capture a larger share of the revenue generated by their work. Unlike streaming, where earnings are based on unpredictable play counts, NFTs offer the potential for more transparent and direct income streams. Music NFTs also act as a bridge between artists and their fans, fostering a sense of community and ownership. By owning an NFT, fans actively support the artist and gain access to various benefits like early access to new songs or exclusive behind-the-scenes content. While music NFTs already exist on several blockchains, they can only represent one digital asset, such as a single song. This restriction is highly inflexible, as musicians typically work with multiple songs packaged as an album or playlist. The current music NFTs are permanently static, lacking the capacity for updates or changes. Musicians desire the ability to evolve and modify their music and copyright terms over time, enhancing fan engagement by offering a continuous stream of fresh content. Although music NFTs hold great promise for fostering deeper connections with fan bases, this potential hinges on one critical factor \u2014 the ability to update the information embedded in the NFT itself. Itheum Protocol, an omni-chain data ownership infrastructure layer , aims to overcome these limitations by allowing musicians to develop and update their content through its Music Data NFT technology. At the heart of the Itheum Protocol lies Data NFT technology, which allows musicians to transform static or dynamic data assets into NFTs. These NFTs function as transferable licenses, granting ownership and control over sharing or trading access rights to the data. Data NFTs empower creators to tokenize their data, similar to other NFT assets, but with the added flexibility of managing access rights. Unlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Music Data NFTs can be updated by artists, allowing for evolving content. This dynamic capability has the potential to enhance fan engagement, offering features like unlocking additional content upon interaction. Moreover, Music Data NFTs give artists greater control over distribution and royalty structures. Verified fans who own Data NFTs can also establish direct communication with artists, creating access opportunities for exclusive content such as unreleased music or merchandise. This connection could strengthen the bond between musicians and their fanbase. Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum envisions Music Data NFTs operating seamlessly across various blockchains. The envisioned interoperability enables artists to access diverse NFT ecosystems, potentially building fanbases and extending their exposure to a broader audience across various blockchain communities.  Key features of Data NFTs. Source: Itheum Protocol Musicians can showcase their Music Data NFTs on NF.Tunes, a Web3 music portal built on Itheum Protocol\u2019s technology. The platform serves as a space for artists to exhibit their music Data NFTs, allowing fans to explore and listen to new music while engaging with artist communities. With its Music Data NFTs, Itheum paves the way for a more artist-centric future in the music industry. By addressing the limitations of the current NFT models, Itheum offers a glimpse into a future where indie musicians not only navigate the labyrinthine world of music but thrive in it.

Still, they said the price dip will be quickly bought by institutional players such as BlackRock, which have been deeply involved in the market since the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. Bitcoin recently broke through its previous all-time high, reaching north of $72,000. The current rally appears to be driven by BlackRock, Fidelity and other institutional investors buying Bitcoin for their new ETFs. According to Austin, the latest rally caught many retail investors off guard, as they were not expecting Bitcoin to rise so rapidly toward its all-time highs. \u201cA lot of people would welcome a crash. I think the institutions are trying as hard as they can not to let that happen,\u201d he said. According to his brother, Aaron, the big differentiator between this and previous bull runs is that spot ETFs have allowed Bitcoin to cross the chasm between early adopters and the early majority, referencing the lifecycle of technology adoption. \u201cWall Street is in for real this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a big differentiator.\u201d At the same time, they said the bulk of retail investors have not entered the market yet, which seems to suggest that we are still in a relatively early stage of the bull market. \u201cRetail largely isn\u2019t here yet based on the social engagement, on Google Trends,\u201d Austin said.

They pierced the $70,000 mark on March 11, signaling continued demand from the traders. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a memo to investors that professional investors were waiting to buy Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, that has not held back the demand for Bitcoin ETFs. According to data from Dune, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated 4.06% of the current Bitcoin supply. If buying continues at the same rate, Bitcoin holdings of the ETFs are projected to reach 8.65% of the Bitcoin supply on a yearly basis. MicroStrategy founder and chairman Michael Saylor said in a X post that the firm had purchased 12,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $68,477, using the proceeds from the recently completed $800 million convertible note offering. After the latest purchase, MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings stand at 205,000 Bitcoin acquired at an average price of $33,706 per Bitcoin. Traders will have to closely watch the Bitcoin ETF inflows because a sustained slowdown will hurt sentiment and may cause a correction. What are the important support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let\u2019s analyze the charts to find out. The S&P 500 Index has been rising inside an ascending channel pattern for several days. The price turned down from the resistance line of the channel on March 8, indicating that the bears are defending the level. Although the upsloping moving averages indicate an advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) cautions of a potential correction or consolidation in the near term. If bears sink the price below the channel, the selling could intensify, and the index may fall to the 50-day simple moving average (4,930). Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level or the channel\u2019s support line, it will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on every minor dip. The bulls will have to kick the price above the channel to start a sharp rally toward 5,350. The U.S.dollar Index (DXY) slipped below the 20-day EMA (103) on March 1, and the bears successfully defended the level during subsequent attempts by the bulls to push the price above it. The failure to rise above the 20-day EMA accelerated selling on March 6. Sellers pulled the price back below the 50-day SMA (103) and the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on March 7. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, and the RSI is near the oversold zone, indicating that bears have the edge. The index could skid to 102 and eventually to 101. Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. A rise above the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the selling pressure may be reducing. The index could then rise to 105. Bitcoin struggled to break above $70,000 during the weekend but blasted above the level on March 11, indicating solid demand from the bulls. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone show that the buyers are in control. The BTC/USDT pair could reach $76,000 and subsequently $80,000. This zone is likely to offer strong resistance to the bulls. It is difficult to call a top in an asset when it is backed by strong momentum. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA ($62,443). That will signal profit booking by the bulls and may start a deeper pullback. The bears tried to pull Ether (ETH) toward the breakout level of $3,600, but the long tail on the March 11 candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels. Buyers have pushed the price above the psychological level of $4,000. That opens the doors for a rally to $4,372, which may act as a minor hurdle, but if this resistance is crossed, the ETH/USDT pair could jump to $4,868. The sharp up move of the past few days has pushed the RSI into deep overbought territory, signaling caution. Sellers will have to drag the price below the 20-day EMA ($3,505) to break the bullish momentum. The pair may then start a corrective phase. BNB (BNB) has been in a strong uptrend for several days. The momentum picked up further after buyers pushed the price above $460. The BNB/USDT pair is likely to reach $560, which may act as a stiff resistance in the short term. If bulls do not give up much ground from $560, the uptrend may continue. The pair may then climb to $617. The essential support on the downside is $460, and then the 20-day EMA ($433). Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to indicate that the uptrend may have ended in the short term. Repeated failure of the bears to sustain XRP (XRP) below the 20-day EMA ($0.60) may have attracted buyers on March 11. The bulls pushed the price above the immediate resistance of $0.67, indicating solid buying at lower levels. Buyers will try to maintain the momentum and challenge the formidable resistance at $0.74. If this level is scaled, it will indicate the start of a new uptrend. The XRP/USDT pair could rise to $0.85 and subsequently to $0.95. Alternatively, if the price turns down from $0.74, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then slide to the strong support at $0.67. The bears are trying to start a correction in Solana (SOL), but the bulls are in no mood to relent. The shallow pullback shows a lack of sellers. Buyers will take advantage of the situation and try to strengthen their position further by pushing the price above $153. If they do that, the SOL/USDT pair could resume the uptrend. The pair may then climb to $184. If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly yank the price below the breakout level of $126. That may accelerate selling, opening the doors for a drop to the 50-day SMA ($110). Related: Why is Bitcoin price up today? Cardano (ADA) dipped to the breakout level of $0.68 on March 11, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.68) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Buyers will try to propel the price to the March 4 high of $0.80. If this level is surmounted, the ADA/USDT pair could extend the rally to $0.90 and later to $1.25. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $0.68. That will indicate a comeback by the bears. The pair then risks a fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.59). The bulls have been fighting with the bears to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the breakout level of $0.16. The rising 20-day EMA ($0.14) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that the bulls have an edge. If buyers propel and maintain the price above $0.000018, the DOGE/USDT pair could retest $0.21 and then rally to $0.26. Contrarily, if the price breaks below $0.16, it will suggest that the bulls have given up. The pair may slump to the 20-day EMA, which remains the critical level to watch out for. A break below this support may start a deeper correction to $0.12. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been consolidating inside a large range between $0.000029 and $0.000039 after the sharp rally, The range-bound action is correcting the deeply overbought levels on the RSI, suggesting that the markets are cooling down. The SHIB/USDT pair may trade inside the range for some more time. If the price breaks below the range, the pair could slide to the 20-day EMA ($0.000024), a crucial level to watch out for. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. On the contrary, a break above $0.000039 will signal that the bulls are back in command. The pair could then rise to $0.000046. If this level is crossed, the rally could reach $0.000065. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Trump had expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency when he was in office but signaled earlier this year that his attitude had changed. Trump called cryptocurrency a \u201cscam\u201d while president and reportedly told Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to \u201cgo after Bitcoin.\u201d Former hopefuls for the Republican presidential nomination Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis were much more vocal and articulate proponents of cryptocurrency.

That\u2019s December 2024 or February 2025.\u201d Additionally, Bitcoin analyst CryptoCoin also expects Bitcoin\u2019s four-year cycle to accelerate by as much as one year.

According to a press release from XPLA, Ubisoft will \u201cactively participate in governance proposal decisions\u201d as part of the partnership.

We eagerly anticipate more validators joining our ecosystem, enhancing the security and stability of our network.\u201d Ubisoft, based in Rennes, France, is among the world\u2019s largest gaming companies. Its games have won myriad awards and sold a combined total of somewhere around 800 million titles. With a market capitalization of $2.75 billion as of the time of publication, it\u2019s the second largest in Europe, behind only Poland\u2019s CD Projekt Red ($2.99 billion). The company was among the earliest gaming firms to invest in Web3 and blockchain technology. Back in 2021, it published a manifesto laying out its plans in the blockchain and Web3 spaces with heavy emphasis on player agency and ownership. As Cointelegraph reported in October 2021, Ubisoft is also a major investor in Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based blockchain games developer. Blockchain gaming continues to rise in popularity as the Web3 space begins to fill out. While it still hasn\u2019t reached its early promises of decentralizing gaming assets at scale and revolutionizing the role of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the public perception, the steady entrance of major gaming outfits such as Ubisoft and Square-Enix bodes well for the sector.

Games in the Web2 market are governed by market demand, profitability, consumer purchasing power and competition among game developers, of which a handful of large developers and producers dominate larger games. All these factors contribute to the success or failure of a title in the mainstream market. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Andy Koh, CEO of GEMs \u2014 an esports aggregator platform \u2014 said that fundamentally, GameFi is subject to many of the same market forces that govern success or failure in the mainstream market. One key factor in particular is maintaining a robust player base. \u201cThe pillars of engaging gameplay, graphics, immersive experiences and a vibrant community remain pivotal in both Web2 and Web3 games,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Web3 gaming industry has to acknowledge that, without a dedicated player community, any game, whether traditional or blockchain-based, faces challenges in achieving sustained success and optimal NFT or token sales.\u201d Using some elements from the Web2 game market, GameFi combines traditional gaming elements with blockchain technology, allowing for ownership of in-game items and rewards in digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). GameFi titles will generally focus on creating a stable, sustainable environment based on digital assets with real-world value and aim for long-term growth. Many Web2 games focus more on external forces, such as new releases replacing the original. Steam is one of the most popular online platforms for traditional games. According to data gathering platform Statista, there are over 73,000 games available on Steam as of 2024. Last year alone, 14,457 games were added to the library, up from 12,533 the previous year, according to data from aggregating website SteamDB. Rather than moving away from its core focus and shifting to the traditional gaming market models of mass production to survive long term, Koh thinks a smaller, more subtle change is required for Web3 games and GameFi in general. According to Koh, many blockchain and Web3 gaming founders grasp the key factors necessary for long-term sustainability and success. However, they can sometimes get too caught up in pleasing investors, leading to substantial marketing budgets that are often misallocated, sometimes at the expense of actual game development. \u201cFrom 2021 to 2023, there has been a notable emphasis on token NFT plays, overshadowing the essential aspect of acquiring dedicated gamers.\u201d \u201cLong-term sustainability remains a formidable challenge, especially when it detracts from the core focus of building and refining the game. Striking a balance between satisfying investor expectations and ensuring the longevity of the project is pivotal,\u201d he added. Roy Kek, co-founder and CEO of Singaporean gaming and esports company Emerge Group, told Cointelegraph that Web2 and Web3 are governed by the same market forces and measures for success. \u201cUltimately, prioritizing enjoyable gameplay, community building and effective user-retention mechanisms will be crucial, regardless of whether a game is Web2 or Web3,\u201d he said. A key factor he thinks very much holds sway over both industries is \u201cstickiness.\u201d Stickiness refers to how often users return to an app or game. Kek said that once \u201ca game achieves stickiness, there are numerous pathways to success.\u201d Related: GameFi opportunities and challenges in 2024 Monetization is also critical to profitability and commercial success for Web2 games and GameFi. In recent years, monetization has become an enormous part of the Web2 market. Features such as in-game purchases, premium paid downloads and ongoing subscriptions have become common to help drive profitability. According to Kek, Web3 games should go down the same road but do it far better than their Web2 counterparts, utilizing the additional monetization options exclusive to GameFi. Specifically, he cites token positioning, which involves positioning the token as a valuable commodity within the game ecosystem, and NFTs, which can represent unique in-game assets that players can own, trade or sell. \u201cFree-to-play Web2 games rely heavily on in-game item sales for monetization, but for Web3 games, there is room for much more creativity in terms of monetization,\u201d he said. Speaking to Cointelegraph, John Schneider, co-founder and CEO of GameFi ecosystem platform Acxyn, thinks GameFi has yet to significantly revamp the conventional gaming industry business model, making it beholden to some of the same market forces. \u201cFor the majority of GameFi projects, establishing a robust fundamental business model rooted in existing and proven value streams is paramount,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bulk of users are situated within traditional platforms like the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Steam, which presently impose limitations on blockchain integration.\u201d Web3 developers have long been saying the mainstream market is critical to the success of the GameFi market in the long term. Overall, there are more than 3 billion Web2 gamers worldwide as of 2023, according to Exploding Topics. Most are considered casual gamers who play regularly but rarely invest significant time. Mohsin Waqar, CEO of Web3 gaming platform Senet, agrees that player numbers are undeniably critical for success in traditional gaming and GameFi. However, he thinks \u201cthe dynamics within the GameFi space are more multifaceted.\u201d \u201cFor instance, AAA gaming studios rely commonly on these metrics to gauge popularity and revenue potential and, in most cases, are the only prime indicators used to determine success,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. \u201cIn GameFi, success isn\u2019t solely determined by these metrics but rather hinges on the viability of token economies, liquidity pools and community engagement strategies.\u201d According to Waqar, unlike traditional gaming revenue streams \u2014 which primarily stem from direct sales, in-game purchases or microtransactions \u2014 GameFi projects often involve decentralized finance mechanisms, such as tokenomics, liquidity pools and yield farming. Related: \u2018Tens of millions\u2019 to enter Web3 through gaming in 2024 \u2014 GameFi execs Additionally, he said player governance is more emphasized, meaning GameFi projects can still thrive with low player counts relative to traditional titles as long as liquidity is present and players are engaged as active stakeholders. However, at the same time, Waqar still believes one guiding principle holds sway over both industries. \u201cFrom a broader point of view, Web3 game developers, GameFi developers, are starting to realize that a player\u2019s enjoyment and fleshed-out gameplay is still, and always will be, the focal point for a gamer\u2019s experience,\u201d he said.","tags":"#Business, #Adoption, #Games, #Mobile games, #Blockchain Game, #GameFi"},{"date":"Mar 11, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zhiyuan Sun","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/korean-mmorpg-maplestory-opens-gaming-experience-avalanche","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Korean MMORPG MapleStory opens gaming experience on Avalanche","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"MapleStory, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by South Korean video game publisher Nexon with over 400,000 daily active users, will expand its gaming experience to the Avalanche blockchain.

Now, in the digital age, European institutions are contemplating the creation of a digital euro \u2014 part of what the European Central Bank (ECB) calls \u201cthe next step in the advancement of our currency.\u201d The digital euro recently completed the investigation phase of a multipart plan from the ECB to determine the design and technical aspects of the proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC). The project has now proceeded to the preparation phase, which the ECB aims to complete by October 2025. While the digital euro is far from complete, it\u2019s already creating discomfort for some EU citizens and politicians who view this transformation of their shared currency as a direct threat to their individual freedom. In February 2023, more than 1,000 demonstrators marched through the streets of Amsterdam to express their rejection of the digital euro. As reported in local media, some demonstrators were concerned about the possible privacy implications of a digital currency. Despite the European Commission stating that the new money would have \u201cthe same level of privacy as cash,\u201d distrust among European citizens and politicians is palpable. Was die K√ºnstliche Intelligenz mittlerweile alles m√∂glich macht, zeigt dieser Thread. Dort spreche ich im Bundestag Englisch, Portugiesisch, Spanisch, Franz√∂sisch, Indonesisch und sogar Chinesisch. Wunderbar. Je mehr Menschen h√∂ren, dass #CBDCs gef√§hrlich sind, desto besser. https://t.co/jI0aeXtHwf \u2014 Joana Cotar (@JoanaCotar) November 10, 2023 While European authorities have issued a number of communications about the nature of a digital euro, there is still a great deal of speculation about its eventual design. According to recent surveys, citizens feel threatened by what surveillance powers governments could gain through a digital euro, while many others are simply not interested. Is one of the most ambitious projects from the ECB threatening the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens? Or is this a matter of miscommunication that could be amended with the right arguments and education? The digital euro may have become a buzzword, but it is simply a digitally transacted euro at its core. For the president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, the digital euro will make the European currency \u201cfuture-proof.\u201d The euro is key to our European unity. A digital euro, existing alongside cash, would future-proof our currency. It would be safe, easy to use and free of charge. While the decision whether to issue a digital euro will be taken later, we\u2019re now launching the preparation phase. pic.twitter.com/fs81p7otVW \u2014 Christine Lagarde (@Lagarde) October 19, 2023 For others, it is something far more profound that requires the European citizenry\u2019s full attention. In a December 2023 speech, Fabio Panetta, governor of the central bank of Italy and executive member of the ECB until late 2023, compared the digital euro to the financial revolution in Italy in the early Renaissance, which created the foundation for the current banking system. Panetta concluded that the digital euro represents the next \u201cpivotal point in the evolution of money.\u201d These high-level statements in favor of a digital euro may be too abstract for the average citizen to grasp, with more concrete arguments needed to convince Europeans. European authorities must clearly answer why European citizens need a digital euro. Failure to make a clear case for the digital euro risks undermining the project before it comes to fruition. Recent: What the Bitcoin halving means for BTC mining centralization Stefan Berger, a German member of the European Parliament (MEP) and part of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union, told Cointelegraph that Europe needs the digital euro to keep up with other countries and regions around the world that are digitizing their economies and experimenting with digital currencies. Berger said that \u201cthe popularity of crypto assets has certainly led central banks to develop digital currencies to ensure they remain relevant in the evolving digital financial landscape.\u201d He believes the digital euro must adapt as new technologies require new digital payment options. Berger emphasized how the euro needs its digital version for its survival: \u201cWithout the digital euro, other digital central bank currencies and stablecoins could dominate the market.\u201d Maria Demertzis, professor at the European Univerisity Institute and deputy director of economic think-tank Bruegel, said that the ECB wants to create a digital euro to promote financial inclusion in Europe and to form a universal European payment method, reducing EU dependence on foreign service providers, as well as having a digital equivalent of cash in the digital age. European officials\u2019 arguments for a digital euro on the grounds of convenience and financial inclusion are complicated by the continent\u2019s cash-heavy payment system. The COVID-19 pandemic may have propelled digital payments throughout the continent, but cash is still undoubtedly the most popular payment option. As of 2023, 59% of total payments were settled with cash. While this overall percentage in the EU has been trending downward (as shown in the graph below), many of the 27 member countries still prefer cash. Technology consultancy BearingPoint published a survey in late 2023 demonstrating that cash usage is significantly higher in Austria (79%) and Germany (71%) than in other European countries. Switzerland (63%), Ireland (61%), the Netherlands (57%) and France (55%) also show a relatively high level of cash use but are well behind Germany and Austria. Finland has a significantly lower frequency of cash usage at 43%. In addition to being a popular payment method, some see cash as a matter of necessity given the 5% of Europeans who are unbanked, numbering some 30 million people. Indeed, European authorities have protected the use of physical cash. On June 12, 2020, the Spanish government introduced a law intending to prohibit cash. One day later, the ECB rapidly struck down the initiative, stating that eliminating cash in the EU is not permitted. Concerns of a cashless Europe have led the ECB\u2019s Lagarde to officially declare that the digital euro will \u201ccoexist alongside physical cash\u201d and that cash \u201cwill always be available\u201d with the intention of not \u201cleaving no one behind.\u201d This insistence on the coexistence of cash and digital money raises questions about the efficacy of a digital euro. Markus Ferber, MEP and member of the European People\u2019s Party Group in the European Parliament, told Cointelegraph that there is no \u201cmajor problem with a lack of financial inclusion in Europe.\u201d He believes \u201cthe digital euro can only be more inclusive if it gets rid completely of the need to have a bank account.\u201d However, Berger said, \u201cPhysical cash is coined freedom. It will remain an integral part of society even in the age of digitalization [...] no matter how far digitalization progresses, cash must never be at stake.\u201d Another issue complicating Europe\u2019s digital vs. cash narrative is that cash is private, and people like privacy. According to a 2022 ECB survey about consumer payment preferences, people using cash payments prefer the method because it allows them to preserve their privacy. Berger stressed how crucial this point is for a successful digital euro: \u201cA CBDC that does not ensure privacy and anonymity will never be accepted by the citizens and is therefore pointless.\u201d Joana Cotar, an independent member of the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament, told Cointelegraph, \u201cPrivacy is essential for personal autonomy and financial freedom, protecting individuals from surveillance and censorship.\u201d Another goal of the digital euro is to provide an autonomous European payments infrastructure. In Europe, there is a plethora of payment services, but none of them work throughout the whole eurozone. For Ulrich Bindseil, director general of market infrastructure and payments at the ECB, \u201cno true pan-European digital means of payment is problematic. This situation forces users who wish to pay digitally to rely solely on private (mostly non-European) payment providers.\u201d The digital euro package highlights the \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d it could offer to tackle the current dependency on foreign payment-related service providers. For Bindseil, EU citizens would also benefit as a digital euro would offer European merchants a \u201ccompetitive opportunity as it would put them in a stronger position to negotiate conditions with private payment solution providers, reducing their own costs\u201d and possibly reducing prices for EU buyers. He added: \u201cA digital euro could be a catalyst for further innovation in the European payments sector.\u201d Conversely, Ferber doesn\u2019t see a problem with the prevalence of private systems. He highlighted how the European private sector is developing a solution to the issue with the European Payments Initiative, all with the participation of European authorities. He said he does \u201cnot want to see that the digital euro crowds out existing systems.\u201d Ferber said that doubts about the digital euro are beginning to emerge in Europe, as \u201cthe proposed design features are quite minimalist. \u201cThat causes people to start asking questions about the added value\u201d it can offer. For Berger, \u201cit is crucial that all open questions are addressed, with participation from all groups.\u201d Bindseil told Cointelegraph that the ECB welcomes \u201congoing democratic debate on the digital euro.\u201d Bindseil believes the \u201cEurosystem has benefited greatly from feedback from European decision-makers, market participants and potential users.\u201d He claimed that \u201call European institutions have to play their part to achieve our common goal of making the digital euro a success.\u201d Despite this apparent openness from politicians and institutes, many are still concerned about financial privacy. The ECB could hypothetically access every citizen\u2019s financial records, as all payments would take place on a digital infrastructure provided by the central bank. Cotar says, \u201cSome argue that the digital euro could serve as a centrally planned and managed Trojan horse for total political control of citizens.\u201d Others worry that the ECB could use this data for other means, such as setting up a Chinese-style social credit system, the goal of which is to regulate social behavior and to rate the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of Chinese citizens through actions like paying bills on time, abiding by the law and reporting financial data accurately. For Ferber, these concerns are unjustified as \u201csocial scoring is not the purpose of this piece of regulation, and no one intends to go down that road.\u201d He adds: \u201cComparing the digital euro project to the CBDC that it is run by a dictatorship is not a valid comparison.\u201d But Cotar is not convinced. She tells Cointelegraph, \u201cThe concerns surrounding the potential misuse of the digital euro as a weapon of control are valid and warrant serious consideration.\u201d She referenced the example of the truck driver demonstration in Canada, wherein the Canadian government froze the bank accounts of truckers protesting official COVID-19 safety measures. While the Federal Court of Canada eventually ruled that the government\u2019s use of the national emergency law to stop the flow of funds and crypto to protesting truckers was unreasonable and unconstitutional, the incident demonstrated how governments might influence financial flows to political rivals. Berger replied that \u201cthe two cases [China and Canada] have nothing to do with the ECB\u2019s digital euro. We understand that criticism and concerns may arise due to the remaining open questions. Nevertheless, the digital euro is a voluntary offer. It is entirely up to individuals whether they choose to utilize it or not. The European Parliament, however, stands by the side of the citizens.\u201d The ECB\u2019s Bindseil said that \u201cthe Eurosystem has no interest in people\u2019s data or payment habits,\u201d adding that \u201cfull anonymity would run counter to other public policy objectives,\u201d as financial regulators would need to ensure compliance to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The ECB could ensure the privacy of the CBDC not by relying on promises from politicians but through technology, such as by launching the digital euro as an open-source CBDC to certify that no back doors exist. Recent: Crypto\u2019s glass ceiling: Obstacles remain for women in Web3 While Ferber said he was \u201cnot convinced that is necessary,\u201d Cotar believes this is a positive path to ensure transparency and to minimize \u201cthe risk of backdoors in its coding,\u201d Cotar said this approach may align with the core democratic principles of the EU: \u201cOpen-source CBDCs align with principles of democratic governance and transparency, allowing citizens to hold regulators and central banks accountable for the design and implementation of the currency.\u201d Bindseil stressed that the digital euro \u201cwould not be programmable money.\u201d He explained there would be an option to automate payment options, such as monthly rent, \u201cbut its use would never be restricted to a predefined purpose, like a voucher, with limitations on where, when or with whom people can use it.\u201d He said this aspect has already been envisaged in the European Commission\u2019s legislative proposal. The digital euro has several lingering questions it needs to tackle before its launch. Citizens and politicians need reasonable solutions backed by solid arguments, and the digital euro needs to demonstrate a privacy guarantee, or it could fail to win the trust of European citizens.","tags":"#Europe, #Adoption, #Euro, #European Union, #Stablecoin, #CBDC, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 11, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ezra Reguerra","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/arbitrum-2-billion-vested-token-unlock","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Arbitrum to unlock $2.32B in vested tokens on March 16","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Layer-2 blockchain network Arbitrum is set to unlock $2.32 billion worth of vested Arbitrum (ARB) tokens on March 16.

Why is there so much anticipation around the upgrade? Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade could be a milestone for layer-2 scaling solutions, as it is expected to significantly reduce the transaction fees of layer-2 networks and enhance Ethereum\u2019s overall scalability. The Dencun hard fork incorporates nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The upgrade\u2019s name combines the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and the Deneb upgrade on the consensus layer. The first part, Cancun, focuses on improving how transactions are managed and processed on the execution layer, while the second part, Deneb, aims to improve the consensus layer, which refers to how network participants agree on the state of the blockchain. The upgrade could significantly enhance the overall scalability, efficiency and security of the Ethereum network, according to James Wo, the CEO and founder of Digital Finance Group. He told Cointelegraph: \u201cA key feature of the Dencun upgrade is the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding. This development aims to reduce layer-2 transaction fees by enhancing data availability, a crucial move toward establishing Ethereum as a scalable settlement layer.\u201d Yet, the fee reduction promised for layer-2 users won\u2019t directly affect users who are transacting on the Ethereum mainnet, according to a March 6 report by Max Wadington, a research analyst at Fidelity Investments. He wrote: \u201cIn the short term, users who wish to benefit from this fee change must sacrifice some decentralization and security by transacting on L2s instead of Ethereum. This will certainly spur more users to bridge assets elsewhere. However, we strongly believe that transacting on Ethereum for application-specific purposes will still be considered the best option (especially for high-value transactions) in the medium term as L2 platforms continue to mature.\u201d Gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet have risen to an average of 98 gwei on March 5, a level not seen since early May 2023. An average swap would cost users $87.45 in gas fees, while nonfungible token sales average $147 in gas, according to Etherscan data. The anticipation around the upgrade boosted Ether to the $4,000 mark on March 8 for the first time since December 2021. The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency is up 14.7% on the weekly and over 59% on the monthly charts. Bitcoin also reached a new all-time high of $71,415 on March 11, 36 days before the much anticipated Bitcoin halving event, which is set to occur on April 20.

In a March 11 X post, Musk said Grok will be open source from this week. While Musk did not elaborate on his plans to make Grok open source, the responses to his post were mostly positive, with users praising him for the decision. One user responded by saying, \u201cOpenAI should do the same. If they are \u2018open\u2019 that is,\u201d to which Musk replied, \u201cOpenAI is a lie.\u201d On Feb. 29, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming a breach of the agreement made when OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit organization. He argues that OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Microsoft goes against the founding principles of the nonprofit agreement to advance open-source artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity. Microsoft had reportedly invested nearly $3 billion into OpenAI by the end of 2023. In the lawsuit, Musk urges OpenAI to return to its initial open-source principles and requests an injunction to stop the for-profit exploitation of AGI technology. However, a few days after the lawsuit was filed, OpenAI executives issued a joint statement revealing emails sent by Musk appearing to agree with the company\u2019s transformation into a for-profit entity.

At the time, the board said they didn\u2019t understand how much his departure would destabilize the company. Musk\u2019s decision to make Grok open source aligns with his requests in his lawsuit against OpenAI to advance open-source AGI for the \u201cbenefit of humanity.\u201d Like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT bot, Grok is an AI chatbot developed by Musk\u2019s company, xAI. Unlike ChatGPT, however, Grok can access real-time information via the X social media platform and answer more hot-button questions that some other AI systems reject. To access the chatbot, users must have a verified X account. According to some comparisons, Grok AI, which is powered by the Grok-1 large language model, surpasses ChatGPT-3.5 but doesn\u2019t perform as well as OpenAi\u2019s ChatGPT-4 model.

Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). DAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO\u2019s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.  But as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment? One of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less. The centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO\u2019s governance. While some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project\u2019s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project\u2019s growth potential over time. Secure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone. Built on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap \u2014 a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance. Understanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:  AirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO AirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users\u2019 benefits to the ecosystem. AirDAO\u2019s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform\u2019s commitment to community governance. AirDAO\u2019s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO\u2019s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.

On March 11, the exchange confirmed that it would accept applications following the guidelines specified in its Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet. However, the exchange did not provide the exact date that it will start accepting applications. In the factsheet, the exchange said that crypto ETNs should be physically backed and non-leveraged. They should have a market price or value measure of the underlying asset that is publicly available and must be backed by Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). The exchange also highlighted that the underlying crypto assets should be \u201cwholly or principally\u201d held in a cold wallet or something similar. In addition, the assets should be held by a custodian subject to Anti-Money Laundering laws in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland or the United States. The exchange defines ETNs as \u201cdebt securities which provide exposure to an underlying asset.\u201d Crypto ETNs allow investors to trade securities that track the performance of crypto assets during the exchange\u2019s trading hours. An ETN is widely considered a soft alternative to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike the ETFs, an ETN is a debt instrument backed by its issuers rather than a pool of assets. ETFs often focus on esoteric debt strategies that do not easily fit into funds.

The financial watchdog also urged exchanges to ensure sufficient controls are in place to protect investors adequately. The FCA also said that crypto-backed ETNs must meet requirements such as ongoing disclosure and prospectuses, which are part of the U.K. listing regime. While exchanges can offer ETNs to institutions, the FCA said that they are unsuitable for retail investors because of their risks. The regulator said that selling crypto-backed ETNs to retail consumers will remain banned. \u201cThe FCA continues to remind people that cryptoassets are high risk and largely unregulated.

Bitcoin derivatives trading and investing in Bitcoin options are other routes that investors use to leverage the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. In investing, a derivative is a product or contract with a value determined by an underlying asset. Cryptocurrency derivatives include futures, options and perpetual contracts. This basic Bitcoin options trading guide focuses solely on Bitcoin options, how investors trade them and some of the risks and strategies. Here, a Bitcoin options contract derives its value from Bitcoin. Investors engage in speculating or \u201chedging\u201d on the price volatility of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin options contract allows a trader to buy or sell Bitcoin at a previously agreed time and date. In contrast to futures, an investor is not obligated to buy or sell an asset at the contract expiry date if they decide otherwise. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin falls, an investor might choose not to buy at the contract price because that\u2019s now higher than the actual value of the crypto. However, each options contract has a price, called a premium, and this must be paid regardless of whether or not the investor goes ahead and the trade takes place. Trading platforms may also charge service fees in addition to the premium. There are Bitcoin call and put options, as well as American and European options. Bitcoin options contracts are, in essence, promises to trade Bitcoin in the future. An option has an expiry date, which is when the contract is executed if the investor goes ahead. Or, American options, as noted, can be executed before the contract expiry date. Options can be physically settled or cash settled per the contract. To settle Bitcoin options physically, Bitcoin would be transferred to the purchaser\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet or to their account on a trading platform. If it\u2019s a cash settlement, the exchange is made in fiat currency. Each options contract has an expiry date, and depending on the type of options contract (American or European), the contract must be executed before or by the expiry date. Suppose an investor buys a Bitcoin call option at $50,000, for which they pay a premium of $800. If Bitcoin\u2019s price drops to $40,000, the investor can opt not to exercise the option, thereby avoiding a $10,000 loss but forfeiting the $800 premium. In another scenario, if the investor buys a Bitcoin call option at $20,000 (known as the strike price), and the price of Bitcoin rises to $25,000. The investor, in this case, may exercise the option, potentially making a $5,000 profit, minus the premium and any additional fee. There are three terms used for Bitcoin options pricing, including: \u201cIn the money\u201d refers to executing the option for a profitable trade. A call option is ITM when the market price of Bitcoin exceeds the strike price of the option. This implies that if the option is exercised, the option holder may purchase Bitcoin for less than its current market value, which might result in a beneficial scenario. A put option is ITM when the market price of Bitcoin is lower than the strike price of the option. This allows the option holder to sell Bitcoin at a price above the current market value, which can be profitable if the option is exercised. \u201cAt the money\u201d isn\u2019t about making a profit or a loss on the options contract, but taking advantage when it becomes profitable. A call or put option is ATM when the market price of Bitcoin is equal to the strike price. While there\u2019s no immediate profit to be made from exercising the option, it\u2019s on the brink of becoming profitable with any upward movement in the market price. \u201cOut of the money\u201d refers to executing a trade that\u2019s not profitable. A call option is OTM when the market price of Bitcoin is lower than the strike price. Exercising the option would result in a loss because the option holder would be buying BTC at a price above the current market value. A put option is OTM when the market price of Bitcoin is higher than the strike price. In this case, exercising the option would lead to a loss because the option holder would be selling Bitcoin at a price below the current market value. The premium, which is the price or fee for buying the option contract, is calculated based on the price of the asset, market volatility, the length of the contract and the strike price. It will also depend on whether the option is ITM, ATM or OTM. Trading cryptocurrencies and their derivatives, like Bitcoin options, involves significant complexity and risk. There are also risks in buying (and owning) and selling cryptocurrency directly, for example, on a cryptocurrency exchange. Newcomers to the cryptocurrency market often start by engaging in direct trades on exchanges to familiarize themselves with the market dynamics before delving into the more complex world of derivatives and options trading. For those interested in exploring Bitcoin options and derivatives, many platforms offer demo accounts. These accounts allow beginners to learn about the intricacies of derivatives trading in a risk-free environment, using simulated funds instead of real capital. Bitcoin options trading can be available on traditional derivatives trading platforms that also offer exposure to other assets, like stocks or gold. Crypto options trading is also available on some major cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Investors may choose to start Bitcoin options trading on a familiar platform, or they may choose to open a new account on a reputable platform or exchange known for its robust trading features. This is the typical route an investor or trader will take to buy or sell Bitcoin options once they understand how derivatives and options work and have decided on a strategy to suit their risk tolerance. The steps will vary according to the type of contract, its terms and the platform. Step 1: Carefully choose a platform or exchange, considering factors such as security, fees, available contracts and user interface. Step 2: Sign up and complete any necessary verification processes required by the chosen platform. Step 3: Deposit funds in crypto or fiat, depending on the platform\u2019s requirements. Step 4: Locate the derivatives or options section on the platform and familiarize yourself with the interface and the types of options contracts available. Step 5: Choose a call or put option based on trading strategy, market analysis and understanding of options contracts, considering fundamentals like strike price, expiry date and premium. Step 6: Enter the details of your trade, such as the size of the contract (number of options) and the price you\u2019re willing to pay. Review and confirm your order. Step 6: Monitor the crypto market, contract or \u201cposition\u201d to stay informed. Step 7: Decide whether to exercise the option (if ITM and it\u2019s an American option), hold it until expiry, or sell the option contract before expiry to close your position, depending on market conditions and your strategy. One way that investors use Bitcoin options contracts is to hedge on the expected price of Bitcoin, a risk management strategy used to offset potential losses in investments. For instance, an investor looking to hedge against potential price decreases in Bitcoin might purchase a put option. This option gives them the right to sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price, protecting them if the market price falls below this level. Conversely, an investor optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s price might buy a call option, giving them the right to purchase Bitcoin at a set price in the future, potentially profiting if the market price exceeds this level. There are many advanced Bitcoin options trading strategies for experienced Bitcoin options traders with multiple positions and contracts in play to balance their risk. These include the covered call, protective put, long call spread and long put spread, to name just a few. Holding the underlying asset (Bitcoin) while selling a call option is known as a covered call. Income can be made from this, but the upward potential is limited. To hedge against a significant price decrease, a protective put strategy involves purchasing a put option in addition to owning the underlying asset. Spreads known as long call and long put entail purchasing and selling options with various strike prices or expiration dates to control the investment\u2019s cost and specify possible gains and losses. Successful traders deeply understand the cryptocurrency markets and Bitcoin derivatives trading products, including how to buy and sell Bitcoin options effectively. They develop a carefully planned strategy and know their risk tolerance, ensuring they only invest what they can afford to lose. Bitcoin options may be attractive to institutional investors, as derivatives are a more familiar investment mechanism. If they are settled in cash, the investor can speculate on Bitcoin price volatility without owning Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin options, like cryptocurrencies and other investments, still have risks. The main risk is the extreme price volatility of Bitcoin, which can result in significant losses in value should the market move unfavorably. Furthermore, there is a greater chance of fraud and market manipulation due to a lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market. Various tactics are available to investors to help them manage these risks. Spreading investments over different assets can help reduce the impact of a single asset\u2019s poor performance, which is why diversification is so important. Additionally, setting stop-loss orders allows the automatic sale of holdings at a preset price and can help limit losses. Moreover, hedging techniques can counteract losses on Bitcoin bets, such as purchasing protective puts or selling covered calls. It\u2019s also critical to keep up with legislative developments and market trends, as these can significantly impact the price of Bitcoin. Risk management tools created especially for Bitcoin markets can also facilitate effective monitoring and management of risk exposure.

The largest cryptocurrency has sealed its highest-ever weekly close, but bulls continue to face stiff resistance when it comes to breaking higher. As the battle for price discovery rages, Bitcoin is caught in a familiar state of flux \u2014 selling pressure at key psychological price levels combined with the relentless bid from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Which will gain the upper hand this week? Few were prepared for the scale of influence now coming from ETF buying. Even longtime bulls are reevaluating where they think BTC/USD could be in the coming years, with $1 million increasingly seen as conservative in the long term. Others conversely warn that the accelerating bull run may spark a macro BTC price top sooner than anticipated. Closer to the present, United States macro data is poised for release in what should \u201cset the tone\u201d for the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming decision on interest rates. With Bitcoin at a crossroads, meanwhile, miners are wasting no time in locking in profit prior to April\u2019s block subsidy halving. Cointelegraph takes a closer look at these topics and more in the weekly rundown of potential BTC price volatility catalysts to come. Bitcoin enjoyed classic volatility into the March 10 weekly close \u2014 which turned out to be easily the highest in history. At $69,000, the high nonetheless failed to last, as a precipitous downside wick took BTC/USD to $67,120 minutes later, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed. Echoing previous taps of the $69,000 area from last week, a relief bounce then set in \u2014 one which ultimately took Bitcoin to new all-time highs during the March 11 Asia trading session. \u201cPrice still getting smacked down around $70K with lack of spot bid lifting those large asks,\u201d popular trader Skew wrote in part of a reaction on X (formerly Twitter). Skew highlighted the area between $63,500 and $65,500 as key to preserving the current uptrend should a more significant drop enter next. \u201cStarting to see more considerable bids from $60K, likely plunge protection bids,\u201d he noted about spot order book behavior on the largest global exchange, Binance. \u201cOverall condensed price chop here with lack of passive spot buyers.\u201d Adding to the picture, Maartunn, a contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, revealed the on-chain movement of coins previously dormant for up to a decade. He referenced the Spent Output Age Bands metric, which groups coins involved in transactions by how long they were previously stationary on the network. \u201cBefore the drawdown, there was a movement of 2,877 BTC with an age of 7 to 10 years,\u201d he wrote about the weekly close. Another \u201cclassic\u201d week in terms of U.S. macroeconomic data is due to be headlined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for February. Due on March 12, CPI makes for volatile short-term trading across risk assets, while Bitcoin offers mixed reactions. The current narrative around inflation and Fed policy remains disjointed. Markets are eager to see interest rate cuts, while Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell last week, are attempting to cool their expectations. The nature of CPI figures and other data points will thus form a key reference point, with the next Fed meeting just over one week away. \u201cA hot CPI inflation report this week would really set the tone of the March Fed meeting,\u201d trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of its weekly diary post on X. \u201cHuge week ahead.\u201d According to the latest estimates from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, hardly anyone sees a surprise rate cut at this month\u2019s gathering, with the odds at a mere 3% at the time of writing. Other key data to come this week include the Producer Price Index, or PPI, along with jobless claims on March 13 and 15, respectively. Bitcoin market observers are waiting for one thing as the week begins: the resumption of buying by the spot ETFs. Now the most successful ETF launch in history, the nine participants have presided over a BTC price transformation that many see continuing. While reservations are visible, ETFs may see waning demand and thus no longer buoy the price trajectory, so a sense of optimism among institutions now stands out. Last week, Cathie Wood, CEO of asset manager ARK Invest, said that the firm\u2019s $1-million BTC price target for 2023 had been \u201cbrought forward.\u201d \u201cNo platform has approved Bitcoin yet, so all of this price action has happened before they approve it, and so we haven\u2019t even begun,\u201d she said about the absence of major U.S. wirehouses such as Morgan Stanley and UBS. As Cointelegraph subsequently reported, industry insiders are gearing up for this to happen and the price impact that could follow. In a memo on March 9, crypto-native asset manager Bitwise listed \u201cmajor warehouses,\u201d \u201cinstitutional consultants\u201d and \u201clarge corporations\u201d as being next in line to add BTC exposure. \u201cBased on current trends, I\u2019d suspect we\u2019ll see our first significant flows from these three groups in Q2 2024, and I think those flows will accelerate throughout the year as these investors become more comfortable with the new products,\u201d chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote. Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high before its next halving \u2014 a unique event in its history. This has surprised many, and miners appear to be no exception. Despite the upcoming halving exposing them to 50% less \u201cnew\u201d BTC per block, miners have significantly upped their selling around the highs. The phenomenon has been witnessed throughout 2024, with outflows from miner wallets beginning at the launch of the ETFs on Jan. 11, CryptoQuant data shows. Total daily revenue on March 7, meanwhile, was the second-highest ever at $75.9 million, CryptoQuant contributor Julio Moreno revealed on X. \u201cWith the recent price of Bitcoin soaring, miner revenues have rapidly increased,\u201d trading suite DecenTrader continued on the topic on March 11. DecenTrader referenced the Puell Multiple \u2014 a measure of the value of coin issuance against its yearly moving average \u2014 hitting some of its highest levels in six years.

Bitcoin (BTC) halvings cut miner rewards in half every 210,000 blocks, which is approximately every 48 months. The answer to \u2018When is next Bitcoin halving\u2019 depends on the day the 840,000th Bitcoin block gets mined \u2014 expected to take place on April 20 \u2014 and will see mining rewards reduced from 6.25 BTC ($418,800) to 3.125 BTC ($209,400). History shows Bitcoin\u2019s price starts ticking upward to break previous all-time highs about four or five months after the halving. On May 11, 2020, during the previous halving, Bitcoin was priced at $8,750. It surged 430% five months later, from $11,500 to $61,300 by mid-March 2021. In doing so, it smashed the previous all-time high of $19,665 on Dec. 16, 2017. Analysts have primarily attributed this to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have caused a radical change in Bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand dynamic, according to Jaran Mellerud, a founder and chief strategist at Hashlab Mining, who recently spoke with Cointelegraph. Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers are scooping up 2,450 BTC each day while only 900 BTC are mined, Mellerud noted. \u201cThis number will fall to 450 BTC post-halving in late April [where the ETFs will be] sweeping up BTC at a rate five times higher than BTC\u2019s post-halving supply growth. This huge imbalance between supply and demand will lead to a continuous but volatile upward grind of the BTC price.\u201d This will multiply Bitcoin\u2019s demand at a time when the halving will reduce its supply, said Mellerud, who expects Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise substantially higher as a result. The health of the Bitcoin network has also strengthened, according to Mellerud, who noted that Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is five times higher than it was at the last halving. \u201cIt now requires five times more computing power and associated electricity supply, electrical infrastructure, and mining hardware to attack the network.\u201d The network was already tremendously secure at the time of the 2020 halving, but now it is basically impenetrable, Mellerud added. Related: Bitcoin mining battles 2023 \u2014 Surging hash rates test industry limits Mellerud noted that Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is now more widely distributed than at the time of the last halving, where Chinese miners controlled a large share of the network. \u201cThis geographic decentralization is continuing as miners migrate to Africa and Latin America to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices,\u201d he said.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Blockchain, #Mining, #Bitcoin Mining, #Halving, #Bitcoin Halving"},{"date":"Mar 11, 2024","summary":"","author":"Martin Young","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-buying-advised-us-enters-looting-the-treasury-phase","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin buying advised as US enters the \u2018looting-the-treasury phase\u2019","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Two crypto influencers on X have called on their followers to snap up Bitcoin (BTC), gold and silver, citing the risk of rising national debt in the United States. In an X post on March 11, entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan argued that Bitcoin is the only realistic solution to escape the inevitability of unsustainable government spending and potential asset confiscation. \u201cWe\u2019re in the looting-the-treasury phase of imperial collapse,\u201d the former Coinbase chief technology officer told his 994,000 followers. Srinivasan argued that government debt and wasteful spending continue to grow rapidly at unsustainable levels. U.S. national debt is currently at a record high of $34.5 trillion, increasing 25% since 2020. Srinivasan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), said there are four approaches to the problem: Deny it is happening, fix it through political processes, give up, and \u201csimply feed yourself at the trough,\u201d or: \u201cStarve the beast with Bitcoin, which is money they can\u2019t easily seize or print.\u201d \u201cThe last is radical but actually realistic,\u201d he said, adding that government deficits are now at $10 billion per day and growing.

America is sick. Prepare now. Buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin. Please take care.\u201d Meanwhile, Srinivasan also warned that as financial reckoning approaches, the \u201cravenous state\u201d may consider confiscating private assets. Srinivasan offered a handful of examples, such as the seizing of assets from protesting Canadian truckers, freezing Russian assets and the \u201cweaponization of Delaware against Elon [Musk] and New York against [Donald] Trump.\u201d \u201cPrivate property will not be protected by the state in a bankrupt Blue America,\u201d he said before adding: \u201cFortunately, we have Bitcoin, which isn\u2019t dependent on the state and can\u2019t easily be seized.\u201d In March 2023, Srinivasan famously bet $2 million that BTC would reach $1 million by June of that year due to hyperinflation in the United States.

In its latest crypto phishing report, Scam Sniffer stated that over $46.8 million was lost to crypto phishing scams last month, noting, \u201cMost victims were lured to phishing websites through phishing comments from impersonated Twitter accounts.\u201d Scam Sniffer found that Ethereum mainnet accounted for 78% of the total thefts, with ERC-20 tokens being the main assets stolen, accounting for 86% of all assets stolen. It added that most Ethereum token thefts were due to users signing phishing signatures and transaction approvals, such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance and Uniswap Permit2. Moreover, most wallet drainers have now started using account abstraction wallets as token approval spenders, it noted. Account abstraction enables more functionality and smart contract compatibility for Ethereum wallets. Despite a higher number of phishing victims than in January, February saw a reduction in the total amount stolen compared to the first month of the year. February also saw a vast reduction in the number of victims who lost over $1 million. Scammers often target social media accounts of high-profile figures, sometimes replying to posts with a fake account designed to mimic the genuine one or even hacking an account to post phishing links. In February, MicroStrategy\u2019s X account was hacked, which lead to around $440,000 in crypto being stolen. Additionally, Compound Finance, Rocket Pool, Blockchain Capital and even Vitalik Buterin have seen their X accounts hacked in recent months by crypto phishers.

In a March 9 post to Ethereum Research, Buterin discussed what would happen if a \u201cquantum emergency\u201d happened as early as tomorrow. \u201cSuppose that it is announced tomorrow that quantum computers are available, and bad actors already have access to them and are able to use them to steal users\u2019 funds,\u201d Buterin postulated. \u201cI argue that actually, we are already well-positioned to make a pretty simple recovery fork to deal with such a situation.\u201d \u201cThe blockchain would have to hard fork and users would have to download new wallet software, but few users would lose their funds,\u201d he added. Buterin explained that the process of such a hard fork would involve rolling back the Ethereum network to the point where it is clear that \u201clarge-scale theft\u201d was occurring and disabling all traditional transactions from that point. Ethereum developers would then add a new transaction type \u2014 which forms part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7560 \u2014 to allow transactions from smart contract wallets. When a user makes a transaction from their Ethereum wallet, the signature of that transaction reveals the public key, and in a \u201cpost-quantum world,\u201d this would see the user\u2019s private key revealed as well. The new transaction type that forms the core part of the quantum-resist EIP would leverage Winternitz signatures and zero-knowledge proof technologies known as \u201cSTARKs\u201d to ensure that existing wallets are switched to new validation code, he added. This validation code leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction \u2014 the underlying technology of smart contract wallets \u2014 to prevent private keys from being displayed while signing transactions in the future, rendering these accounts immune from a quantum attack. Related: Ethereum leans into rollup-centric future as Dencun hard fork looms According to Buterin, users who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are \u201calready safe\u201d from any potential quantum-related exploit, as only the wallet address has ever been made publicly available. He also added that the infrastructure needed to implement such as hard fork \u201ccould in principle start to be built tomorrow.\u201d The advent of quantum computing has been a long-feared inflection point for the crypto industry, as a computer capable of breaking blockchain encryption could see once-untouchable user funds stolen in large volumes and at rapid rates. However, most computer scientists and developers believe that quantum computing is still a ways off, with Google and IBM engineers estimating that quantum computing won\u2019t be sufficiently developed until 2029 at the earliest.

The number of Bitcoin whales, unique addresses holding more than 1,000 Bitcoin, has risen to 2,104 as of March 7, suggesting they anticipate the uptrend to continue. Bitcoin\u2019s rally has improved sentiment across the cryptocurrency sector. Data from DefiLlama shows that the global total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols jumped above $100 billion for the first time in about two years. However, the TVL is far below the $189 billion record set in November 2021, even after the increase. During a bull market, traders throw caution out of the window and chase prices higher. This generally does not end well. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan cautioned investors to be careful, stating on X that \u201cterrible projects\u201d were \u201ctrading at crazy valuations.\u201d If Bitcoin rises to a new high, select altcoins are likely to join the party. Let\u2019s look at the top 5 cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts. The bears are trying to halt Bitcoin\u2019s rally near $70,000, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will try to resume the uptrend by kicking the price above $70,000. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and surge to $76,000. This level may act as a minor hurdle, but if crossed, the rally could reach $80,000. If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sell aggressively and yank the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($61,422). That may hit the stops of several short-term traders and start a deeper correction toward the 50-day simple moving average ($51,197). Both moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the bulls are in command. Buyers have kept the price above the 20-EMA, signaling buying on every minor dip. A close above $70,000 could start the next leg of the uptrend. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair may slide to the 50-SMA. A close below this support will be the first sign that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. The pair may then dump to $59,000. Optimism has been in an uptrend for the past few days. The break above the $4.20 resistance completed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on March 5. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.12) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $4.87, the OP/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $5.79. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the breakout may have been a bear trap. The pair may then drop to $3.42. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair has held the price above the breakout level of $4.20, suggesting a positive sentiment where every slight dip is being purchased. Buyers will try to overcome the barrier at $4.87 and establish their supremacy. If they succeed, the pair may climb to $5, where the bears may again mount a strong defense. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 50-SMA. That will increase the likelihood of a retest of $4.20. The bears will have to tug the price below this support to suggest the start of a corrective phase. Bittensor (TAO) has pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($646), which is an important short-term level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls remain in control. That will enhance the prospects of a break above $757. The TAO/USDT pair could then resume the uptrend toward $846. Instead, if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are booking profits in a hurry. The pair could then slide to the 50-day SMA ($535). The bears will have to pull the price below the 50-day SMA to signal a potential trend change. The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the $700 level. This suggests that the bears remain sellers on rallies. If the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the next stop could be $617. If this level also fails to hold, the pair may plunge to $550. On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the current level, it will signal that the bulls are trying to flip the $700 level into support. If they can pull it off, the pair may retest $757, which is likely to be broken. The pair may then skyrocket toward $850. Related: XRP has disappointed vs. Bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 Is a price rebound possible? The bulls successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($2.77) during the correction in Stacks (STX). This shows a positive sentiment where the bulls continue to buy the dips. The solid bounce on March 10 shows that the bulls are back in full force, but the long wick on the candlestick indicates that the bears have not yet given up. Buyers will have to propel the price above $3.39 to signal the resumption of the uptrend. The STX/USDT pair could jump to $4.58 and eventually to the psychologically important level of $5. The 20-day EMA remains the crucial level to watch out for on the downside. If bears pull the price below this support, it will signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then fall to the 50-day SMA ($2.20). The 4-hour chart shows the price moved up sharply after breaking above the downtrend line, but the failure to surmount the $3.39 level attracted profit booking. The price has dipped to the downtrend line. If the price rebounds off the current level with strength, it will enhance the prospects of a break above $3.39. Conversely, if the price continues lower and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may decline to $2.40 and later to $2.20. Mantle (MNT) has been charging higher, but the bears have not given up and are trying to stall the rally at $1.15, as seen from the long wick on the March 8 candlestick. A minor advantage in favor of the buyers is that they have not allowed the price to stay below the psychological level of $1. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat. If buyers shove the price above $1.15, the MNT/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up move to $1.37 and then $1.50. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and nosedives below the 20-day EMA ($0.91). The pair could tumble to $0.85 and subsequently to $0.80. The bulls are trying to flip the breakout level of $1.01 into support. If they do that, it will signal strong buying at lower levels. If buyers drive the price above $1.07, the pair could reach $1.15. A break above this level could signal a pick-up in momentum. Alternatively, if the bears pull the price back below $1.01, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. There is a minor support at the 50-SMA, but if this level gives way, the pair may drop to $0.85. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The elections represent a significant shift in Portugal's political landscape. In 2022, former Prime Minister Antonio Costa won a historic victory, gaining an outright majority in the parliament with 41.37% of the votes. The center-left Socialist Party (PS) had a green light to rule the country without the need to form coalitions. However, the administration has been marked by corruption and scandals, which led to several resignations, including Prime Minister Costa. The events forced the president to call for new elections and have shaken the PS\u2019 hegemony in Portuguese politics. The latest poll from Consulmark2 shows the election to be neck-and-neck. Most respondents \u2014 nearly 30% \u2014 favored the new center-right coalition Democratic Alliance (AD) led by candidate Luis Montenegro. But while AD may be leading the polls, it is barely ahead of the PS\u2019 Pedro Nuno Santos at 27%. Recent: Crypto\u2019s glass ceiling: Obstacles remain for women in Web3 This tied position is uniquely powerful to the newly founded right-wing political party Chega with 18.2% of the votes. Founder Andr√© Ventura has been quick to capitalize on the dissatisfaction with the ruling PS and has marketed itself as the party for the Portuguese people. In the lower range, the center-right Liberal Initiative (IL) (6%), left-wing Left Block (BE) (5.2%), ecosocialist Livre (4.6%) and communist Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU) (2.5%) may have the chance to influence government as part of a coalition. Portugal has been known worldwide to be crypto-friendly since 2016. Its unique tax regime and regulations have converted the country into a global hub for crypto users and blockchain companies. How could a new government with different policies affect Portugal\u2019s status as a digital asset hub \u2014 one of Europe\u2019s few crypto hotspots? Portuguese political parties are unique in that all national parties have included cryptocurrency positions in their electoral programs. The crypto Portuguese association New Economy Institute, formed by prominent members of the Portuguese crypto community, has highlighted the major differences within each political party. The most crypto-friendly group is the novel political party Chega, which in its updated program for 2024, expressed its intention to solidify Portugal\u2019s status as a global crypto hub. The party says it wants to expand the adoption of blockchain technology with real use cases at the institutional level. Its proposal claims it will \u201cinvest in technology education starting in primary education with introductory courses on the digital economy, specifically cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, programming and blockchain.\u201d It also wants to include coding and blockchain in school curriculums. The AD has a similar stance, but it only wishes to introduce coding in the national education program to position Portugal within the top 10 countries in digitalization in Europe by 2030; there is no mention of blockchain. Chega also intends to \u201cstudy the possibility of the state using blockchain technology to drastically reduce bureaucracy and administrative complexity and ensure greater transparency.\u201d The party mentioned blockchain would be useful in different fields, from administrative improvements such as property and land registration to a digital identity managed by blockchain technology. Additionally, Chega advocates for using blockchain technology for administrative procedures such as licenses and certifications as a way of addressing Portugal\u2019s complex bureaucratic system, which, in its opinion, is deliberately generated to hide corruption. PS has already enabled crypto-friendly policies and wants to resume its Web3 national strategy initiated by the former secretary of state, who joined the government after leaving Microsoft in 2019. The project was halted in December 2023 after the resignation of Prime Minister Costa. The principal political parties have a neutral or friendly policy for cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation, which should be good news for crypto advocates living in Portugal. But some of the smaller players, with whom the winning party may have to form a coalition in order to make a government, feel differently. The New Economy Institute highlights how an alliance between PS, BE and CDU may push the PS to ditch its existing crypto-friendly regime, as the latter parties are more hostile to digital assets. As the New Economy Institute noted, the BE\u2019s program specifies how it would like to tax \u201call crypto asset-related gains currently exempt\u201d under Portugal\u2019s Personal Income Taxation regime. The party also wants to create a \u201cmandatory reporting system for the value of one\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings and all crypto transactions,\u201d including crypto-to-crypto, fiat and acquiring goods and services. But this hinges on whether BE would have sufficient power to force PS to remove the crypto-friendly policies in Portugal. This outcome may not be as probable, as PS candidate Nuno Santos declared in a televised debate that the party would let AD govern in minority to ensure that Chega doesn\u2019t get a seat in government. AD\u2019s Montenegro has neither confirmed nor denied if it would ally with Chega to form a government. If the possibility of a government with Chega and AD emerges, PS may feel forced to search for a broader coalition with the left, which could result in less crypto-friendly policies. Continuity in crypto legislation would have a positive outcome for the Portuguese crypto community, Henrique Corr√™a da Silva, the president of the New Economy Institute, told Cointelegraph. The only result that could be detrimental to the crypto community would be if BE entered the government. As polls have demonstrated, there is a small probability this could occur. However, what would happen to Portugal if the crypto-friendly policies were modified to a more restrictive approach? For Portuguese-based crypto influencer Sebastian Montgomery, the sudden removal of the special fiscal regime for digital nomads would drastically increase his tax rate. While the tax regime wasn\u2019t the sole motivator for his move to Portugal, it played a strong role. If crypto-related policies change drastically, he said he would consider leaving. But the crypto industry is very location-agnostic and can move easily, as Mitchell Amador, CEO of Immunefi, explained to Cointelegraph: \u201cThe crypto industry is very mobile and can leave easily if the terms turn unfavorable. Many other countries will welcome them in a heartbeat. They can easily leave and take away the economy they created here, along with the jobs they created.\u201d The Portuguese Web3 ecosystem has thrived in the last years with over 650 companies in Portugal, as per the Portuguese Web3 association Quo Vadis records. Despite Portugal having one of the most attractive crypto-friendly legislations in the world, it ranks 58th worldwide for crypto adoption, according to a 2023 Chainalysis study. Recent: What the Bitcoin halving means for BTC mining centralization Corr√™a da Silva said that Portugal has a unique chance to create sustainable generational wealth through crypto adoption. He compared the current moment to Portugal\u2019s golden age some 500 years ago when the king and the elites realized that the only way to grow was by adopting technological innovation and knowledge. This realization enhanced the Portuguese navy\u2019s ability to explore the world thanks to its innovative weaponry and superiority in mathematical sciences, astronomy, navigation, geography and the study of the tides. Corr√™a da Silva said that the new oceans to be explored are now in the digital world. He believes Portugal can become a major international actor once again by exporting cutting-edge technology and expertise, and even convince Portuguese talent living abroad to return to Portugal. However, he said that in order for any of this to happen, the industry needs to settle and mature. In this election, the future of Portuguese political society is at stake, as well as the possibility of building and solidifying a hub for digital assets.","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Law, #Politics, #Europe, #Portugal, #European Union, #Elections, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 10, 2024","summary":"","author":"William Suberg","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-bull-cathie-wood-ark-invest-btc-price-target-1m","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood: ARK Invest BTC price target \u2018well above\u2019 $1M","type":"Blog","category":"Markets News","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $1 million sooner than 2030, the CEO of asset manager ARK Invest has said.

In 2024, traders have been unable to close decisively above this trendline. In 2024, XRP\u2019s slump also coincides with its declining whale count. Notably, the number of its richest addresses holding at least 100,000 tokens has declined substantially this year. This suggests diminishing (wealthy) investor interest in XRP. Meanwhile, the ongoing legal dispute between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple added to the uncertainty, suggests Bill Morgan, a pro-crypto lawyer tracking the case.

The bullish technical scenario has XRP price eyeing a 15% jump toward $0.75 by June 2024. This level is near the XRP/USD pair\u2019s descending trendline resistance and the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement line. Moreover, a decisive breakout above the resistance confluence of XRP\u2019s descending trendline and 0.236 Fib retracement line could push the price to as high as $1.11. Interestingly, such a scenario would repeat a 2014-2017 fractal, shared by market analyst Coosh Alemzadeh. Should history repeat, Alemzadeh anticipates XRP\u2019s price setting a new record high above $3.55 over the next few months. Conversely, a potential pullback from the descending trendline resistance positions XRP for a drop to $0.50, down 20% from the current price levels. This level is crucial as the ascending trendline support level. This $0.50-level is where the bulls will certainly make a stand: it's a confluence of the 200-week exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) and a multi-month ascending trendline support.

In separate interviews with Cointelegraph, local crypto stakeholders said the delisting of Nigerian naira-related services from Binance will lead to the rise of new crypto exchanges, which will fill the vacuum created by Binance\u2019s exit by complying with local regulations. Nathaniel Luz, the CEO of Flincap \u2014 a liquidity platform for crypto exchanges \u2014 said that several Nigerian traders who make a living from trading peer-to-peer on Binance are now affected. However, Luz said that some are trading on WhatsApp and Telegram groups. According to the chief marketing officer of Flincap, Oladotun Wilfred Akangbe, the continuing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in Nigeria and the decision to halt Binance operations can undermine the confidence of many people in the space. He added that it could lead to massive fear, uncertainty and doubt in Nigeria\u2019s crypto space. In an official statement on its website, Binance said it would automatically convert naira balances to Tether (USDT) from March 8 at 8:00 am UTC and cease support for naira deposits from March 5 at 2:00 pm. Withdrawals have not been allowed since March 8 at 6:00 am, and the conversion rate is 1 USDT for 1,515.13 naira.

The suggestion comes in response to a rapid decrease in the Dai supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the last seven days, as outlined in the proposal from BA Labs, a member of Maker\u2019s Stability Advisory Council. In the proposal, MakerDAO intends to expedite the approval process for a stablecoin stability measure if users choose to redeem a portion of the $1.1 billion in real-world assets (RWA) available on the protocol. Despite Dai being overcollateralized, using RWA vehicles as collateral poses potential liquidity issues if Dai\u2019s selling continues. The proposal reads: \u201cLiquid stablecoin reserves and reserves deployed to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure generated by the potential bullish market sentiment. The issue lies in the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure toward stablecoins deployed through RWAs.\u201d Although Maker DAO\u2019s ecosystem is currently stable, it deems it necessary to anticipate potentially unpredictable user actions. The proposed measures include changes to Maker Vaults, the SparkLend DAI Borrow Rate, the Peg Stability Module (PSM), the Dai Savings Rate and the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.

This is the first time in nearly two years that DeFi TVL has exceeded the $100 billion mark. The increase appears to be due to a return of positive sentiment to the crypto markets since the launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. The institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs drove the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs this week, topping $70,000 on March 8.

According to data compiled by Bitget Research, memecoin Korra (KORRA) has seen a 577% rise in the last seven days, followed by a 235% surge for Ribbit (RIBBIT) and a 232% jump for PUG AI (PUGAI) in the same period. Popular tokens, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE), have seen gains of 168% and 165%, respectively. Memecoin market capitalization stands at $61 billion at the time of writing, according to Bitget data. Due to the memecoin trend, Dogecoin (DOGE) and SHIB are now among the top 1 tokens by market cap, with $26 billion and $20 billion, respectively.

The innovative potential of digital currency payment solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms is often overshadowed by regulatory uncertainties and security concerns. The space is marred by projects that operate outside of regulatory frameworks and offer incentives in proprietary tokens. Raising questions about the sustainability and safety of emerging financial models, the lack of compliance with established financial regulations puts the sector in a challenging position. While innovative, rewarding participants with platform-native tokens also introduces volatility and risk for participants. DeFi needs the introduction of solutions that aim to remove the stigma associated with the space by offering a registered, compliant alternative that prioritizes user security and regulatory adherence. Skew, a Swiss-based decentralized platform, bridges the gap with traditional financial systems and prioritizes regulatory compliance, security and stability. Powered by Skew Labs SA \u2014 a registered company in Switzerland \u2014 the platform aims to provide capital access to qualified borrowers and offer lenders attractive interest opportunities. Skew is committed to meeting stringent regulations set forth by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). It has already invested significantly in partnering with specialized Swiss blockchain law firms and physically moved its offices to Switzerland to ensure full compliance with FINMA regulations. The platform adds another layer of security with its noncustodial service offering, which comprises lending services and a crypto debit card. Users retain complete control over their private keys and assets in the noncustodial approach, reducing the risk of theft or mismanagement by third parties.  Skew aims to increase the adoption of DeFi technologies through regulatory adherence. Source: Skew Skew addresses a common criticism of DeFi projects by paying out lending annual percentage rates (APR) in Tether (USDT) on USDT lending. Skew\u2019s approach \u2014using stablecoin instead of a platform-native token for APR payments\u2014 mitigates the volatility associated with platform-native tokens, offering a more stable and familiar currency format that aligns with traditional financial expectations. Composed of 12 individuals whose backgrounds span a diverse range of fields outside of crypto, Skew\u2019s team brings experience to the project. The multidisciplinary team aims to address longstanding challenges in the DeFi industry through innovation, security and compliance. Daniele Capasso, CEO of Skew, emphasized the ease-of-use Skew offers and expressed their anticipation of an increase in USDT holdings as more people lock in gains in a bull run, adding: \u201cWe aim to be one of the first DeFi protocols in Switzerland to receive full regulation, which will increase the safety of our users and make using cryptocurrency in daily life easier. Our USDT lending service will enable businesses with a good reputation to obtain loans, helping all involved grow DeFi the right way.\u201d Skew aims to launch within the next three months and is in the process of private and public funding rounds. Private sale participants are offered an 18% APR, paid in USDT. The evolution of DeFi into a more secure and regulatory-compliant sector is crucial for its broader acceptance and integration into the global financial ecosystem. Projects like Skew that prioritize these aspects while delivering innovative financial solutions are poised to lead the way in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital economy.","tags":"#Switzerland, #Decentralization, #Debit Cards, #Lending, #DeFi, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 09, 2024","summary":"","author":"Zoltan Vardai","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-whales-not-selling-btc-price-70k","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin whales not selling despite $70K \u2014 BTC holdings growth \u2018is going parabolic\u2019","type":"Blog","category":"Markets News","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) whales are not in a rush to sell into the current rally that propelled Bitcoin to new heights above $70,000, the latest on-chain data suggests. The number of unique addresses holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin \u2014 known as whales \u2014 has risen to 2,104 addresses as of March 7. However, this is still lower than the record of 2,489 addresses reached in February 2021, when Bitcoin was trading above $46,000. The rising wallet count could also be attributed to the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which surpassed $52.5 billion in cumulative trading volume on March 4. The fact that whales are not selling their Bitcoin at these levels suggests that they expect prices to rise further. Bitcoin whales are important because the size of their trades can significantly impact price. Julio Moreno, the head of research at on-chain intelligence firm CryptoQuant, also took note of the growth in a March 7 X post. Moreno wrote: \u201cThe growth of whales\u2019 Bitcoin holdings is going parabolic.\u201d Further evidence of Bitcoin whales not rushing to dump their holdings comes from several metrics measuring volumes between whales and exchanges. Glassnode data shows that transfers from exchanges to whales have also \u201cgone parabolic\u201d to new record highs this month. Meanwhile, the transfer volume from whales to exchanges has only seen a modest uptick compared to previous bull and bear market periods. Overall, these metrics suggest a big influx of new investors into Bitcoin and that there is little sign of profit-taking by wealthy investors despite record high-level BTC prices. On a fundamental level, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continue driving demand for BTC. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), for example, recorded its highest daily inflows of $788 million on March 5.

In a recent report, the FBI stated that investment losses involving crypto increased from $2.57 billion in 2022 to around $3.94 billion in 2023, representing a 53% increase. Meanwhile, the overall amount lost from all investments in 2023 totaled $4.57 billion. This means the $3.94 billion lost in crypto-related fraud made up approximately 86% of all investment fraud losses in the nation.

This movement may have been driven by gains in the broader market, but it solidified BNB as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins. Some traders anticipate that BNB's price breaking above $500 is inevitable, but can the rally be sustained? Many investors doubted BNB could ever reclaim the current levels, especially after Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao entered a plea deal with the United States federal court in November 2023 for allowing exchange users involved in illicit activities to transfer \u201cstolen funds\u201d through the exchange. At that time, CZ agreed to step down as CEO, casting doubt on the future of the BNB token given that part of its value stems from the Binance exchange ecosystem. CZ\u2019s trial is still pending sentencing, but the fact that Binance settled with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in Dec 2023 helped alleviate uncertainty about BNB\u2019s future. Binance was mandated to implement a formalized corporate governance structure, including compliance and audit committees. Meanwhile, CZ was ordered to remain in the U.S. until his sentencing date. As cryptocurrency volumes surge to their highest levels in 12 months, some major exchanges, including Coinbase, experienced multiple outages, sparking criticism from various quarters. Crypto investor @Rampage_Calls lamented Coinbase\u2019s frequent outages on social media, while Binance trading reportedly remained unaffected. Vijay Boyapati, a Bitcoin enthusiast and former Google software engineer, likened Coinbase's inability to provide liquidity during market rallies to MtGox, the bankrupt exchange that once dominated the market until its lack of proper structure led to a hack. Vijay urged Coinbase\u2019s co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong to \u201cfix this ASAP,\u201d citing similar issues that plagued the exchange during the 2017 cycle. In a way, part of Binance\u2019s success, driving leadership in spot and derivatives trading volumes, stems from its robust trading engine and servers \u2014 at least when compared to Coinbase. Consequently, this movement encourages users to buy in, aiming to benefit from reduced trading fees and the ability to participate in the exchange\u2019s token launch platform. However, much of the utility of BNB comes from the BNB Chain, making it sensible to analyze the network activity. The network\u2019s smart contract deposits, measured by the total value locked (TVL), decreased by 7% in the past 30 days in BNB terms. Data reveals that 12.8 million BNB has been deposited in BNB Chain\u2019s decentralized applications (DApps), which is significantly lower than the 19.4 million recorded in early 2023. For comparison, Ethereum network TVL increased by 3% in ETH terms over the past 30 days, while Solana experienced a 20% TVL gain in the same period. One could argue that certain DApps, such as NFT marketplaces and decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregators, do not necessitate large deposit sums. Therefore, measuring volume activity provides a better gauge of network use. The recent rally in BNB\u2019s price appears justified by BNB Chain\u2019s 41% DApp volume gains in the past 30 days, and, notably, its third-place ranking overall. Furthermore, BNB Chain stands out when analyzing the number of active addresses engaging with its DApps, reaching a remarkable 5.6 million. A more thorough analysis of the quality of BNB Chain\u2019s activity and the potential impact on the Binance exchange after CZ\u2019s trial is necessary to determine whether BNB is poised to reclaim the $500 level. Nonetheless, the initial data seems bullish. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He indicated that traders are reallocating portions of their Bitcoin (BTC) into other crypto investments, causing price increases across the market. In a recent series of posts on X, Hougan explained that Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge has led investors to spread their profits across more questionable crypto tokens, potentially giving them a false sense of legitimacy. \u201cBe careful out there. Lots of terrible projects get funded in exuberant bull markets and many are already trading at crazy valuations.\u201d Cointelegraph reported that altcoins, led by memecoins and artificial intelligence (AI) themed cryptocurrencies, outperformed BTC during the week up to March 7. Hougan reiterated this is because investors gained confidence after an increase in their Bitcoin investment, leading them to opt for riskier assets in hopes of higher returns. \u201cCrypto natives make money in Bitcoin, feel rich, and then look for more speculative assets to invest in,\u201d he declared.

And since the November 2022 lows, bitcoin\u2019s market cap has grown by $1 trillion.\u201d Meanwhile, he explained that when Bitcoin\u2019s price spiked in previous times, the amount of wealth generated was comparatively lower despite the percentage increase being higher. \u201cBy comparison, in earlier cycles, the amount of wealth generated by bitcoin rallying was smaller on an absolute dollar scale at this stage in the cycle, even though it was larger on a percentage scale,\u201d he explains.

According to the new law, a DUNA is a separate legal entity from its members, meaning that the DAO can be held liable without implicating its individual members. \u201cA person is not liable for a breach of a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association\u2019s contract merely because the person is a member, administrator, authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association or considered as a member by the nonprofit association.\u201d A DAO is an entity with no central leadership.

However, the bears have not allowed the price to maintain above $70,000, suggesting that every higher level is being sold into. Along with a surge in price, Bitcoin\u2019s spot trading volume has also increased, suggesting that retail traders are back in the market. Bitcoin\u2019s daily spot trading volume soared to $46.26 billion across centralized exchanges on March 5, the highest level in a year. After the recent rise, some investors seem ready to book profits. Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin transfers to Coinbase have risen near the 2022 highs. As Bitcoin hovers near $69,000, select major altcoins have resumed their up move, indicating that traders may shift their attention to altcoins. According to Blockchain Center\u2019s altcoin season index, an altseason has not yet started, but K33 Research believes it is about to begin. Could repeated failures to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s price above $69,000 start a correction in the near term? Will altcoins also succumb to selling pressure? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. The bulls pushed Bitcoin to a new all-time high on March 8, but the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick shows profit booking at higher levels. Still, a positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded ground to the bears. This suggests that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If bulls kick and maintain the price above $70,000, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to soar to $76,000 and then $80,000. Conversely, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below $62,500, it will indicate profit booking by short-term traders. The pair may then slide to the 20-day exponential moving average ($59,727). The bears will have to yank the price below this support to suggest the start of a corrective phase. Ether (ETH) turned up after the correction on March 5 and broke above the overhead resistance of $3,822 on March 6. That signaled the resumption of the uptrend. The ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,150 and then to $4,375. If the price turns down from the overhead zone but finds support at $3,600, it will suggest that the rally may continue for some more time. A word of caution to the traders is that the RSI has been trading inside the overbought zone for several days. This suggests the pair is ripe for a correction or consolidation in the next few days. The bears will gain the upper hand on a dip below the 20-day EMA ($3,352). BNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($404) on March 6 and broke above the immediate resistance of $427. The BNB/USDT pair thereafter picked up momentum and pole vaulted above the stiff overhead resistance of $460. If bulls maintain the price above $460, the pair could start the next leg of the rally to $500 and then $572. The 20-day EMA remains the key support level to watch out for on the downside. A break below it will be the first sign that the bulls are aggressively booking profits. The pair may then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($348). The bulls have successfully held Solana (SOL) above the breakout level of $126 in the past few days, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls catapulted the price above the $143 resistance on March 7, indicating that the correction may be over. If buyers maintain the price above $143, the SOL/USDT pair is likely to travel to the next target objective at $158. If bears want to prevent the up move, they will have to quickly sink and sustain the price below $126. If they do that, several short-term bulls may exit their positions, pulling the pair down to the 50-day SMA ($107). XRP (XRP) has been stuck between the overhead resistance of $0.67 and the 50-day SMA ($0.55) on the downside. If the price stays above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair is likely to climb to $0.67. This remains the crucial short-term resistance to watch out for. If bulls overcome the $0.67 obstacle, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $0.74. A break above this level will indicate the start of a new uptrend. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could slump to the 50-day SMA. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might because, failing to do so may sink the pair to $0.50. The bulls are trying to keep Cardano (ADA) above the breakout level of $0.68. This is a positive sign as it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the $0.68 level into support. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.67) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the bulls are in command. Buyers will try to push the price to $0.80, which is likely to act as a significant hurdle. If the bulls clear this hurdle, the ADA/USDT pair could resume the uptrend. The pair could then rise to $0.90. On the contrary, if the price continues lower and breaks below $0.68, it will indicate that the traders are booking profits at higher levels. That could open the doors for a possible fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.57). Dogecoin (DOGE) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the $0.16 level. A minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to sustain below $0.16. This shows solid demand at lower levels. Buyers are again trying to maintain the price above $0.16. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could gradually climb toward $0.18 and then retest $0.20. If this level is cleared, the next stop could be $0.24. The strong support on the downside is at $0.15. A close below this support could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($0.13). After such a sharp fall, the pair may enter a range-bound action for a few days. Related: What do Bitcoin\u2019s all-time highs mean for crypto industry expectations in 2024? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has pulled back in a strong uptrend. The price is finding support near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000032. After the sharp rally, the possibility of the SHIB/USDT pair remaining inside a range is high. The pair could oscillate between the 50% retracement level of $0.000027 and the local high at $0.000046. A break above this resistance will signal the resumption of the uptrend. The pair may then climb to $0.000065. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.000027, it will suggest that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could sink the pair to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.000023. The deeper the fall, the greater the time needed for the start of the next leg of the uptrend. Avalanche (AVAX) climbed back above the 20-day EMA ($40.54) on March 6 and the overhead resistance of $42 on March 7, suggesting buying at lower levels. There is a minor resistance at $45.20, but if bulls overcome this barrier, the AVAX/USDT pair could accelerate toward the psychological resistance of $50. This level may offer a stiff resistance, but if crossed, the rally could extend to $57. Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal a lack of aggressive buying at higher levels. That could sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($37.38). Polkadot (DOT) recovered sharply on March 6, and the bulls cleared the overhead hurdle at $10.80 on March 7. However, the bulls could not sustain the breakout, indicating that the bears continue to sell on rallies. The bears will try to strengthen their position further by pulling the price to the breakout level of $9.59. This level is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls. If the price rebounds off $9.59, the likelihood of a rally above $11 increases. The DOT/USDT pair could then climb to $13.18. This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($8.91). That will indicate the start of a deeper correction to $8.

MicroStrategy is set to raise $600 million as part of a move to buy more Bitcoin. The company is considered the cryptocurrency\u2019s largest corporate holder. The funds will be raised in the form of senior convertible notes maturing in March 2030 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. MicroStrategy said it \u201cintends to use\u201d the net proceeds from the sale to buy more Bitcoin for general corporate purposes. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy\u2019s class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of MicroStrategy\u2019s class A common stock. The firm currently holds 193,000 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries. The U.S. SEC has delayed its decision to approve or reject BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETFs. The regulator first delayed its decision on the crypto ETF applications in January, shortly after it approved a roster of spot Bitcoin ETFs to go live. The SEC can delay its decision up to three times. The delay hasn\u2019t come as a surprise, with market commentators and ETF analysts long speculating the SEC would decide on the ETFs once the first final deadline arrives in May. Smart contract platform Fantom wants the Singapore High Court to declare the Multichain Foundation bankrupt, which it says could open an avenue for it to recover the $122 million that was stolen from Multichain\u2019s Fantom bridge last year. According to Fantom, Singapore\u2019s High Court granted it a default judgment ruling for Multichain\u2019s \u201cbreach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentations.\u201d The court will assess the damages and demand repayment from Multichain. However, Fantom is also seeking an appointment of a liquidator, similar to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States. If approved, the liquidator would \u2014 among other powers \u2014 have the authority to take over the Multichain Foundation\u2019s assets, claw back transactions and recover other assets with the aim of paying back creditors it allegedly owes. Seamless Protocol is launching an Integrated Liquidity Market (ILM) on Lido for wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH), offering borrowing strategies for tokenholders seeking an alternative to traditional restaking. According to Seamless, the ILM will enable stakers on Lido to automatically use a borrowing strategy and compound positions on wstETH, meaning that it automatically reinvests the returns from staked ETH to potentially increase the users\u2019 rewards. Seamless borrowing strategies target single-purpose loans, where the lender knows where the liquidity is being used, and the borrower cannot use it for anything else.

The stock has rebounded to surpass the $250 mark for the first time in two years on March 8, following a significant downturn during the crypto winter that saw its shares plummet to as low as $33 in 2023. Over the past year, Coinbase shares have risen over 300%. Boosting the movement is Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price performance, also hitting a record high on March 8, briefly touching $70,000 before bouncing back to around $68,000. Increasing flows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation surrounding BTC's upcoming halving are driving the cryptocurrency rally. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), for instance, reached $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) on March 1, just seven weeks since its launch. Coinbase is getting a piece of Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 revenue. Its custody arm, Coinbase Custody, has partnered with most of the asset managers that launched Bitcoin ETFs in January. It is expected that the products will generate between $25 million and $30 million in fees for the company. The crypto exchange\u2019s latest earnings call revealed a resilient fourth quarter in 2023. Coinbase\u2019s net revenue reached $905 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 45.2% from the third quarter, exceeding consensus expectations of $825 million.

Ether climbed from a price of $3,873 on March 8, soaring more than 4% in the last 24 hours and 74% year-to-date, to hit a 27-month at $4,003 on Bitstamp, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ether\u2019s price performance appears to be boosted by Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Dencun update and the possible approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. ETH resumed its uptrend on March 8, while other top-cap cryptocurrencies flashed greed and Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $68,000. Ether has stayed on the path, marching steadily toward the much-awaited $4,000 psychological level as the community waited for the Ethereum network\u2019s Dencun upgrade. The Dencun upgrade, the most significant improvement to the Ethereum network since the Merge, aims to implement a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which introduces \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d Proto-danksharding is a feature that allows the blockchain to use blobs, thereby simplifying the transaction process by storing some data off the blockchain, speeding up transactions and cutting costs for layer-2 chains and rollups that depend on Ethereum. Ethereum developers have set the Dencun mainnet to go live on March 13. Another factor driving ETH\u2019s price performance is the expectation that the SEC will approve one of the several spot Ether ETF applications before it. Related: Bitcoin price hits a new all-time high Despite the regulator delaying its decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications from BlackRock and Fidelity, market participants remain hopeful that one will be allowed soon. The financial watchdog is expected to deliver a decision on all the spot Ether ETF applications on the same day, as it did with Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, so as not to give one issuer undue advantage over others. The statutory deadline for the SEC to allow or deny an Ether ETF is set for May 23. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the SEC will not take as long to process Ether ETF applications as it did with Bitcoin ETFs. In a Feb. 7 post on X, Seyffart that May 23 is the \u201conly date that matters\u201d when it comes to Ether ETFs. Drawing from the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their market debut on Jan. 11, a spot Ether ETF product is expected to perform in a similar manner, allowing more capital to flow into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Institutional investors could further increase their Ether exposure, as attention will subside from Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high, according to Siddharth Lalwani, the co-founder and CEO of Range Protocol. He told Cointelegraph: \u201cOnce the attention from Bitcoin moves away to the potential of an ETH ETF, liquidity will retrace and consolidate at high levels, leading to price rallies for the macro outlook. All in all, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that it won\u2019t be long before institutional investors take bigger positions in Ether. \u201d This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Over 10 years later, in 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first batch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications from a mix of crypto native and traditional financial institutions. The approvals, however, led to questions about the differences between buying Bitcoin in a peer-to-peer transaction on an exchange and investing in Bitcoin ETFs. What is the difference between owning Bitcoin ETFs and owning Bitcoin? Like Bitcoin, do ETFs offer profits? All of these questions and more are answered in Cointelegraph\u2019s new video, Legends & Myths about Bitcoin ETFs Debunked, which breaks down the most common misconceptions about Bitcoin ETFs. In terms of ownership, Bitcoin and ETFs are different. When you invest in a Bitcoin ETF, you buy shares in the fund, not the actual Bitcoin itself. This means you\u2019re exposed to the price movements of Bitcoin without owning it directly. Owning actual Bitcoin involves buying the digital currency directly and storing it in a digital wallet. In this way, you are in control of the private keys and, therefore, your coins. Fact: A Bitcoin ETF tracks the price of Bitcoin but doesn\u2019t give you ownership of actual Bitcoins. Neither investment offers a guaranteed profit. In fact, investing in a Bitcoin ETF or directly in Bitcoin carries risk, as the price of Bitcoin is highly volatile. Remember, the Bitcoin ETF mimics Bitcoin\u2019s price movements, which means its value can fluctuate based on market conditions. Before investing in Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin itself, investors should do their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Fact: Bitcoin ETFs, like all investments, come with risks, and there\u2019s no guarantee of profits. While Bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of Bitcoin, they may not mirror its fluctuations perfectly. Bitcoin is known for its high volatility, which can result in substantial price changes within short periods of time. On the other hand, a Bitcoin ETF, being traded on a regulated stock exchange, may experience less volatility thanks to market mechanisms like trading hours and the possibility of incorporating other assets or strategies to mitigate risk. Fact: While Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, their volatility can be different due to factors like management fees and tracking errors.

Based on historical trends, Bitcoin (BTC) often undergoes notable price fluctuations before and after a halving event. However, despite the potential for volatility, there are investment opportunities, and conducting a technical analysis can help traders with their investment decisions around the Bitcoin halving event. This article showcases some strategic investment opportunities employed by traders in past Bitcoin halving events. However, remember that all investments carry some degree of risk, so engage in extensive investor education before trying these Bitcoin investment strategies. Despite the uncertainties around pinpointing the next Bitcoin halving date, the following sections delve into the strategies to capitalize on the Bitcoin halving event when it finally occurs. The strategy relies on the principle of \u201cbuying the rumor, selling the news.\u201d Investors follow the market news and sentiment to understand market dynamics, conducting market analysis and making a move when they spot trading signals. However, this is one of the most challenging ways to capitalize on the Bitcoin halving because an investor\u2019s timing has to be spot on, which is rare. Bitcoin halving events have historically positively impacted the price of Bitcoin, setting off capitalizing trends. Halving events often cause optimistic market sentiment, leading to bullish runs before and after. The projected scarcity in Bitcoin supply boosts its demand, driving its value upward. However, the historical post-halving price rise is no guarantee that the same will happen after the 2024 halving. Always do your own research to better understand price trends. To develop their trading techniques, a trader needs to assess their risk tolerance and map their investment goals. This will depend on whether a trader is using Bitcoin as a store of value or leveraging the frequent price fluctuations to make profitable decisions. Once an investor understands their risk appetite and investment horizon, they can formulate a short or long-term strategy: Related: Bitcoin Halving: Latest News and Full Coverage by Cointelegraph Traders adopting this strategy usually capitalize on regular price movements to achieve short-term gains. It requires detailed technical analysis and the adoption of sound trading strategies to pull off. They also monitor price movements, identify trends and set entry and exit points. This is also known as a buy-and-hold (hodl) strategy. While there is no guarantee the price will increase after the 2024 halving event, past events show Bitcoin\u2019s price increases a few months or years later, hitting all-time highs each time. Employing the dollar-cost averaging DCA strategy means investing a set amount of money at fixed, regular intervals, regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s current price at those intervals. The strategy aims to reduce the impact of market volatility by spreading the investment over time. DCA has proved a solid strategy for other investors during times of high price volatility, so it could work when high volatility occurs during Bitcoin\u2019s halving (which historically has led to substantial price movements). It takes away the pressure of trying to time the market perfectly. Additionally, the DCA strategy helps soften the blow of short-term price fluctuations by accumulating Bitcoin over time. This ensures investors reap potential long-term price gains by averaging out their cost basis. One of the key investing strategies is diversifying portfolios, aligning with the investment saying, \u201cDon\u2019t put your eggs in one basket.\u201d This enables investors to spread their risk by investing in different assets, minimizing the impact of an underperforming investment. While BTC may be the main investment asset, a trader could exploit other cryptocurrency opportunities in a well-balanced portfolio. If the price of Bitcoin goes up, for instance, a Bitcoin holder could sell some of their BTC and invest in other cryptocurrencies or traditional asset investment avenues to beef up their investment portfolio. As always, investors should conduct a fundamental analysis of all potential investment assets before committing to any decision. A derivative is a contract between a trader and another party, with Bitcoin as the underlying asset setting the value of the derivative. Focusing on Bitcoin derivatives trading in the context of halving events involves leveraging the increased volatility and market speculation that often accompany these periods. Traders rely on derivatives to set the terms of the speculation and engage in derivatives trading when they wager about the future price movement of Bitcoin, hoping to gain if they bet correctly. They may also engage in derivatives trading as a hedge against long positions; that is, they expect the value of Bitcoin to increase. Derivatives trading could help cover some losses if Bitcoin\u2019s price does not rise within the given time. Here\u2019s how trailers utilize derivatives during Bitcoin halving events: Under the terms of an options contract, the trader has the right to buy the Bitcoin at a specified amount (strike price) within or at the end of a set period. The contract does not place an obligation to buy the underlying asset. Traders could use options to buy or sell Bitcoin when the price is most favorable in light of the high volatility usually experienced during halving events. For instance, a trader may buy call options before a Bitcoin halving event if they believe that the halving will cause an increase in the price of Bitcoin since the supply of BTC will be reduced. In contrast, a trader may purchase put options if they anticipate a price decline due to possible short-term sell-offs or market adjustments. Holding futures contracts enables the trader to buy or sell Bitcoin at an agreed price on a set date. Unlike options contracts, they are obligated to buy or sell the contract at a future date. Traders may engage in futures contracts to speculate on or hedge against the post-halving price movements. For instance, to lock a price for purchasing or selling BTC at a later time, perhaps around the halving event, traders may choose to enter into futures contracts. A trader may enter a long futures contract if they believe the price will rise after the halving. On the other hand, a short futures contract can be advantageous if they anticipate a price decline. Also known as perpetual swaps/futures contracts, these are the cryptocurrency equivalent of the traditional financing contract for differences. The main difference is that perpetual contracts have no expiry dates, unlike futures and options contracts. A trader can hold the position for as long as they can pay the funding rate or holding fees. Usually, there is a difference between the index price and the perpetual contract price because the price of Bitcoin changes frequently during halvings. If the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the index, those holding a long position generally cover the price difference by paying the funding rate. Similarly, if the price of the perpetual contract is lower than the index\u2019s, traders who \u201cgo short\u201d typically pay the funding rate to cover the difference. Perpetual contracts appeal during halving events since they don\u2019t expire and let traders hold long or short positions eternally. If traders believe that the halving will result in a sustained price increase, they may go long; if they think there will be a decrease or more volatility, they may go short. Risk management strategies to navigate Bitcoin volatility The golden rule of investing states that traders should only invest what they can afford to lose. This is especially true considering Bitcoin\u2019s volatility. Regardless of the historical price rise post-halving, there\u2019s no telling which way the Bitcoin price will swing, so an optimal halving strategy should include setting up a stop order. The order will sell the asset when prices drop lower than the investor expected, stopping excessive losses. On the opposite end of the stop-loss order is the take-profit order. Bitcoin price volatility means it can surge when a trader is not actively trading and then falls as soon as they start. To capitalize on potential profits, traders can set up a take-profit order, which automatically triggers the sale of assets once the price reaches a predetermined, desirable level. The ultimate goal of the above approaches is to secure profits in a volatile market while shielding assets from catastrophic losses. However, regardless of any event, investors should assess their risk tolerance and align investments with their financial goals. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

A unified platform would simplify the onboarding process, enhancing clarity and promoting faster adoption of Web3 use cases. Web3, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and digital currencies, is rapidly evolving. However, its fragmented nature mirrors the chaos of the early internet before the dot-com bubble. The lack of interoperability between decentralized networks and poor communication across different Web3 sectors contribute to this disarray.

Crypto enthusiasts have to use various decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms to perform multiple transactions and interact with the different sectors of Web3. However, this isn\u2019t a sustainable growth model for the Web3 industry and is more of a deterrent rather than a benefit when it comes to crypto adoption. A one-stop shop platform could be a good start for beginners who can try various Web3 use cases from a single starting point.

If approved, the community would donate up to 600,000 ARB tokens in the first year, worth nearly $1.3 million at the time of writing. A proposal submitted on March 7 by pseudonymous delegate DK seeks to fund a \u201crobust legal defense\u201d for Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the developers behind the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In addition, the funds could be used for public relations and advocacy efforts promoting awareness around privacy-preserving technologies and legal burdens for developers. \u201cBy rallying support for their legal fund, we aim to safeguard not only the future of privacy-preserving technologies but also the broader principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within our industry.\u201d The proposal sets three tiers for voting under different funding levels, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 ARB. To date, more than 80% of the votes have been cast for the highest tier. The deadline for voting is March 14. The accusations against Tornado Cash and its founders revolve around the platform\u2019s alleged role in laundering over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. As a result, Tornado Cash has been subject to significant legal actions, including its addition to the United States sanctions lists, effectively banning residents in the country from using the service and sparking controversy within the cryptocurrency community. Supporters of Tornado Cash argue that the platform merely provides software for decentralized money transmission and does not directly engage in money transmission itself, which challenges the basis of the charges against its developers. According to the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidelines state that an anonymizing software provider should not be considered a money transmitter. Storm and Pertsev face several charges from U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The first two charges can each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the charge for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison. \u201cThese [legal] challenges not only threaten the developers\u2019 ability to continue their work but also undermine the fundamental principles of decentralization and individual freedom upon which projects with privacy-preserving technologies are built.\u201d The community proposal comes just a few days after the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser dedicated to collecting legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, citing a breach of their terms of service that could \u201cexpose GoFundMe, its employees or Users to any harm or liability of any type.\u201d Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers","tags":"#Blockchain, #United States, #Regulation, #Tornado Cash"},{"date":"Mar 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"Helen Partz","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-ath-memes-celebrating-price-peaks","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin price ATH in memes: \u2018Same same, but different\u2019","type":"Blog","category":"News","content":"Cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has spawned thousands of memes since its inception in 2009, with the community creating tons of funny pics to chuckle about its ups and downs as well as other related events. On March 8, 2024, Bitcoin made another all-time high (ATH) price level of $70,199 after breaking the long-standing record price of $69,000 on March 5, 2024. Bitcoin\u2019s latest price milestone has been no exception for crypto meme makers and artists, as the event has triggered massive attention on social media. Cointelegraph has picked a few Bitcoin ATH memes to chuckle at one more time this weekend. The Dune and Bitcoin meme has amassed massive attention on social media, with the community showing much love amid the premiere of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s epic science fiction film Dune: Part Two in the United States in early March. The meme plays around Dune\u2019s chronology, bringing up parallels between the movie\u2019s announcement date, the part one premiere and the new movie with Bitcoin\u2019s historic ATHs. The meme appears to have been originally created by Zurp co-founder Troy Osin The meme builds upon not only the sense of chronological coincidence but also the existing meme base, which refers to the actual science fiction novel Dune by Frank Herbert. The fictional melange has much in common with Bitcoin, as it\u2019s a decentralized digital currency, and its supply is programmed to be limited to 21 million coins. By combining the themes of Dune and Bitcoin in a meme, creators may be drawing parallels between the scarcity, value and power dynamics associated with the fictional world of Dune and the real-world phenomenon of Bitcoin. More of a concept art masterpiece than a meme, Lina Seiche\u2019s Bitcoin ATH art builds upon the price closeness of the most recent ATH to the previous Bitcoin ATH set two years ago. As some skeptics might probably get critical of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cinsufficiently high\u201d price record and \u201csameness\u201d with the previous ATH, Seiche\u2019s art emphasizes that it\u2019s quite different this time from the context perspective. The latest Bitcoin ATH has been recorded amid solid industry events like the successful launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, years of adoption by nation states like El Salvador as well as growing Wall Street adoption. On the other hand, the previous Bitcoin ATH in November occurred during the crypto industry\u2019s significant reliance on platforms that subsequently collapsed due to alleged fraud, including crashes of the FTX and the Terra ecosystem and the massive crypto lending crisis. The Bitcoin ATH drove some magic attention to social media and DMs of someone\u2019s EX. No need to go into details on that one, Reddit has it all. The ongoing rally of Bitcoin brought the cryptocurrency\u2019s prices to levels not seen in more than two years. After hitting $69,000 in November 2021, BTC started plummeting and dropped below $17,000 by the end of 2022. The cryptocurrency then traded around $20,000 for a long time before it headed its way toward new all-time highs in late 2023. No one knows how much higher Bitcoin will grow during another bull run and whether it is too early to sell for those who bought in November 2021. The meme plays on sarcasm over the classic narrative of Bitcoin haters, who prefer not to own BTC because they believe it\u2019s a scam. Needless to say, Bitcoin critics must be happy they \u201cfound out\u201d that BTC was a \u201cscam\u201d some time in 2011 when it cost $3. Bitcoin\u2019s most recent ATH brought back some old and gold memes about good and bad timing for buying by no-coiners, or people who don\u2019t own Bitcoin for certain reasons. While many no-coiners apparently only realize they should have bought some BTC only when Bitcoin hits another ATH, they forget they wanted to purchase some Bitcoin by the time it touches lows again. How much should Bitcoin fall so no-coiners are back to laughing at hodlers? $2,000 should be enough, memes say. The John Cena Bitcoin meme by Cointelegraph\u2019s social media expert Sohail Shaikh was a nice chuckle for the team. You should check it in case you\u2019ve missed it. \u201cI think the idea for that meme was, while everyone was celebrating the ATH, nobody was talking about the patience of hodlers. So it was a kinda ode to them,\u201d Shaikh noted. 2021 investors be like: pic.twitter.com/61zjtfvuVt \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 5, 2024","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Twitter, #Reddit, #Bitcoin Price, #Adoption, #Bitcoin Industry, #Bitcoin Community"},{"date":"Mar 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"William Suberg","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-price-hits-70k-all-time-high-us-jobs-data-dollar","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Bitcoin price hits $70K all-time high as US jobs data squashes US dollar","type":"Blog","category":"Market Update","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) hit new all-time highs on March 8 after United States unemployment numberboosted the case for interest rate cuts.

Despite the increased participation of women in the workforce following the Second World War, the Third and Fourth Industrial Revolutions \u2014 both characterized by the increasing involvement of tech in industrial and commercial processes \u2014 carried the same glass ceiling to advancement for women. There have been efforts to reduce the gender gap in the tech industry as well as to break the glass ceiling in the 21st century. Yet despite more women entering the tech sector, much work is needed, as the gender disparity in tech-related careers is still glaring. The blockchain space has significantly expanded since the inception of Bitcoin (BTC), bringing forth a brand-new industry. Web3 could represent a chance for women to be part of the next revolutionary leap forward in tech and finance. However, are women being included in this revolution, or is the Web3 industry following the same pattern as the legacy financial and technological sectors? Despite women entering the cryptocurrency space and making notable contributions, much work is still needed. Boston Consulting Group\u2019s (BCG) 2022 analysis of the industry found that only 7% of Web3 founders are women, and among top crypto startups, 27% of employees are women. That gender disparity extends to crypto investors as well. The data clearly shows low participation from women in the Web3 industry, but what are the reasons behind this? Cointelegraph asked several women from diverse fields within the Web3 industry for their insights. Layne Haber, co-founder and CEO of interoperability protocol Connext, told Cointelegraph, \u201cOne of the biggest roadblocks is a lack of senior mentors and role models.\u201d She added that \u201crepresentation at senior levels is incredibly important, as it can shape how young women view the possibilities for their future.\u201d To Haber\u2019s point, a 2022 study by Forex Suggest looked into the diversity at several crypto companies and revealed a lack of female role models, with few companies having more than 20% female representation in senior leadership or even one woman on the board. Recent: DeFi pump-and-dump schemes rake in millions, harm industry credibility This lack of women in senior roles creates a negative spiral where women feel underrepresented and are less motivated to enter a field, she said. Margot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute and a Bitcoin mining sustainability and environmental consultant, told Cointelegraph she thinks the core fields composing the crypto sector may be the cause for the low participation of women: \u201cThe intersection of technology and finance seems to be a perfect storm.\u201d The presence of men is very high compared with women in both finance and tech. As the BCG research reveals, women are more present in Web3 projects where social skills are more relevant than technical skills. Cecilia Hsueh, co-founder and CEO of layer-2 blockchain Morph, told Cointelegraph that the Web3 sector might fall into the same trap as other tech sectors, despite its good intentions: \u201cDespite the decentralized and inclusive ethos of blockchain technology, disparities in leadership roles, funding and visibility for women remain apparent.\u201d Hsueh emphasized that \u201cunequal access to funding for female-led startups\u201d doesn\u2019t help motivate female entrepreneurs to enter the field. In a 2023 op-ed, Mariana Krym, the chief operating officer of Vyvo Smart Chain, wrote that out of all Web3 companies that raised more than $100 million, there were no projects with all-female founding teams. Catie Romero-Finger, the co-founder of Web3 marketing agency Babs, told Cointelegraph that women find it difficult to enter the Web3 space because of its ambiguity. She said that Web3 isn\u2019t easy to study as a consolidated career; it requires a leap of faith by getting one\u2019s hands dirty and figuring out the path as it goes. Romero-Finger believes that the uncertainty may be \u201cintimidating for women.\u201d In her opinion, men tend to be comfortable trying something new, even in the face of failure, while women don\u2019t. As she said: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk ourselves up like men or are willing to take as many risks because we simply feel, and maybe we are, called out more often if we fail.\u201d Sandy Carter, chief operating officer of Unstoppable Domains, agrees with this idea of there being a fear of failure, telling Cointelegraph that women tend to wait to be fully confident to step into a new space. A 2013 internal Hewlett Packard report reportedly found that women tend to apply for a job once they meet all the requirements, while men will apply if they meet roughly 60% of the conditions. Carter believes women should dare to take more risks to be able to step into the game, despite not feeling completely prepared. All the women with whom Cointelegraph spoke could immediately provide incidents in which they felt discriminated against for being women. Haber mentioned that during her first conference, nobody believed she had technical expertise. \u201cPeople kept quizzing me about our codebase and my contributions to it.\u201d Similarly, Hsueh felt \u201cchallenged to secure funding,\u201d as she \u201cwas not taken seriously in technical discussions.\u201d Romero-Finger mentioned that despite being the founder of her own company, one client would only work with a male executive with whom he was close at her company. Ultimately, she \u201cwas forced to take a step back\u201d and let her male team member deal with the client. Paez highlighted how women tend to receive \u201cmore sexualized hate and trolling on social media.\u201d Carter said she got more attention while posting about tech-related topics on social media under a man\u2019s name. She also recalls how a bank executive would only speak with her male boss even when she was brought into the meeting as an expert. The situation was so awkward that her boss acted like he was sick and left the meeting abruptly, forcing the banker to talk directly with Carter. The crypto industry has been accused of having a \u201cbro\u201d culture, and incidents such as the 2018 American Bitcoin Conference ending its event at a strip club haven\u2019t helped. While the industry has evolved since then, has the culture changed into a more inclusive one? Romero-Finger believes the industry is still \u201cvery bro-focused.\u201d In her experience, she has noticed how her women-led firm benefits when the third partner of her company, a man, is on the call. In Carter\u2019s opinion, the bro culture is especially hostile to women trying to learn more about the Web3 space, as it\u2019s not open to people asking questions. As a result, she started Unstoppable Women to provide a safe space where women can learn about the Web3 industry. While it\u2019s clear that there is a glass ceiling, things may be changing. Web3 is still a very young industry that has yet to consolidate. The novelty of the industry offers an opportunity for women to establish themselves at top-ranking levels. Recent: Energy-efficient miners in US less likely to be impacted by Bitcoin halving Haber sees an \u201cenormous amount of potential for women to shape their leadership trajectories.\u201d However, women shouldn\u2019t wait too long, otherwise it could become a male-dominated sector with a solidified glass ceiling. Romero-Finger called out to encourage women to step in: \u201cWe are all learning here, so there is no imposter syndrome. It is a great opportunity to dive in, and women need to learn to dive in more!\u201d Some of the most useful ways to gather more visibility and support include \u201cinitiatives such as women-led blockchain education programs, networking events and targeted scholarships,\u201d according to Hsueh, who thinks promoting stories of successful women can encourage and motivate others to join and innovate in the Web3 space.","tags":"#Law, #Business, #Decentralization, #Technology, #Women, #DeFi, #Trading"},{"date":"Mar 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"Tobias Vilkenson","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/women-influence-in-web3-and-tech","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Women\u2019s influence across Web3 and tech positions","type":"Blog","category":"Overview","content":"Amid the ongoing celebrations of International Women\u2019s Day 2024, the theme \u201cInvest in women: Accelerate progress\u201d resonates powerfully within the Web3 and tech industries. Despite modest advancements, the persistent lack of gender diversity remains a significant challenge, with women often confined to non-technical roles. Rooted in historical imbalances, this disparity hampers innovation and inclusivity. Nonetheless, women significantly impact Web3, playing vital roles in advocacy, research and community development. Embracing this year\u2019s theme, investing in women is expected to drive innovation and promote inclusivity for all in various sectors, advancing equity and prosperity for all. Despite signs of progress in the crypto space and increasing inclusivity across the Web3 and tech industries, one glaring issue persists: the persistent lack of gender diversity. Despite industries\u2019 best efforts, the numbers paint a stark picture. Although the proportion of females in Web3 companies rose marginally to approximately 27% in 2022,, women predominantly occupy non-technical roles, as highlighted by Boston Consulting Group\u2019s 2023 research. Similarly, findings from Deloitte shed light on the fact that women make up a mere 25% of tech professionals, underscoring the uphill battle for gender equality in the tech realm. But why does this matter? Well, it affects everything from how products are developed to user interfaces and even the adoption of Web3 innovations by the wider Web2 community. With fewer female voices at the table, there\u2019s a risk that products may inadvertently cater more to male perspectives, potentially alienating a significant portion of users. So, what\u2019s causing this disparity? It\u2019s a complex web of factors deeply rooted in historical imbalances within the tech industry. The lack of female Web3 representation in decision-making roles only perpetuates biases and limits diverse perspectives. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Women in the Web3 and tech industries encounter obstacles to accessing investment and funding and face online discrimination. Underrepresentation in leadership roles hampers diverse viewpoints and inclusive decision-making. Addressing these challenges requires a dedicated effort to break down fundamental barriers and create an environment where women can thrive in Web3 and technology. It\u2019s not just about equality; it\u2019s about unlocking the full potential of these innovations for everyone. Since the beginning of the crypto industry, women have been involved in developing various projects, communities and brands in the crypto space, in addition to taking on many of the challenging tasks that this emerging industry requires. Nevertheless, they haven\u2019t been active in launching Web3 companies. According to Bitget\u2019s research, under 9% of Web3 firms in the sector were female-led startups in 2023. Recognizing the variety of leadership roles available to women in the Web3 ecosystem can help achieve gender parity, which was previously thought to remain a distant goal. Within this 9%, women have played pivotal roles across various leadership and founding positions at Web3 companies, including CEOs, founders and C-level executives. Women lead strategic direction, oversee financial, operational and technological aspects and ensure the company\u2019s fiscal health and sustainability. This female involvement in executive roles has proven to positively affect companies. Firms in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams benefiting from female leadership were 25% more likely to achieve above-average profitability compared to those in the fourth quartile, according to a McKinsey & Company analysis of 2019. As Web3 reshapes industries, women also seize opportunities to work in emerging sectors and contribute to their growth through diverse roles: Women have long been integral to the evolution of technology, yet their representation in the sector remains staggeringly low. Despite possessing equal levels of ambition, women encounter unique hurdles hindering their advancement in tech leadership roles. Accenture\u2019s research in 2020 reveals that the proportion of women in tech has decreased over the years. In 1984, women constituted 35% of the tech workforce, yet by 2020, this figure had dwindled to 32%. Despite these statistics, the tech industry\u2019s demand for skilled professionals continues to soar. As technology permeates every facet of our lives, roles such as data scientists and software developers have become increasingly pivotal. In the tech industry, women can directly influence the development and adoption of innovative tools and help them reach a broader audience, occupying various roles: With strong representation in UX roles, women\u2019s understanding of user needs enhances the design of intuitive and accessible decentralized applications. In 2024, 53% of UX designers in the United States are women, according to CareerExplorer. Women in data science leverage analytical skills to derive insights from vast data sets, driving informed decision-making and shaping the future of industries through data-driven strategies. According to the Royal Statistical Society, the male-to-female ratio in the field exceeded 4:1 in 2023. By adding a variety of viewpoints to the design and development process, women in software development help to create innovative digital solutions that lead to more inclusive and user-friendly software. As reported by Statista, a global survey in 2023 found that roughly 23% of developers worldwide were female. Women in blockchain development pioneer decentralized technologies, promoting transparency and trust in various sectors, while also advocating for inclusivity and diversity within blockchain communities. Besides leading cross-functional teams to design and deliver innovative products, women in product management also drive technological developments and promote inclusive innovation in the tech sector by developing solutions that cater to the varied needs of global audiences. According to Zippia\u2019s statistics, in 2021, 34.7% of product managers in the U.S. were female. Beyond the appeal of creativity and high compensation, Web3 and tech jobs offer a plethora of benefits that resonate with many female professionals. According to KuCoin\u2019s survey of 2022, a substantial 60% of female professionals acknowledge the unique advantages these industries present, signaling a notable satisfaction level within the industries. The Web3 and tech industries can offer women job security and are considered one of the most stable fields. For instance, an analysis by CompTIA of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for January 2024 indicates that the unemployment rate in the tech industry is between 2% and 3%, which is lower than the overall unemployment rate. The Web3 and tech industries often offer competitive salaries and benefit packages. By entering these fields, women can achieve financial empowerment, which can lead to greater financial independence and the ability to save and invest money for their future. With the rapidly evolving nature of technologies, there\u2019s a constant demand for qualified professionals. Whether in leadership roles or software development, women can take advantage of this demand to advance in their careers. For instance, data and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the rapidly growing tech sectors, with 30% of women in the total number of AI employees globally, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGlobal Gender Gap Report\u201d of 2023. Flexible employment alternatives, including remote work, freelance jobs and part-time positions, are frequently available in the Web3 and tech industries. This flexibility can be especially helpful for women who are not in the workforce but have other obligations or are pursuing further education. Women in tech and Web3 can promote innovation and tackle social issues. Their distinct viewpoints influence inclusive solutions, support diversity, and serve as an inspiration for upcoming female leaders. By entering these sectors, women in the tech industry empower others and themselves while also bringing forth constructive change and leaving a lasting impact. The future of women in the Web3 and tech industries holds immense potential for innovation, collaboration and advancement. Through developing skills and the cultivation of a growth mindset, women can thrive in the Web3 and tech job markets and make valuable contributions to a better and more innovative future. Moreover, Web3 and IT firms can foster greater inclusion and diversity by giving women equal opportunities for growth and recognition, as well as accessible funding and resources, flexible work environments and varied leadership and role models. Consequently, investors will eventually be able to see that their prejudices are unfounded as the number of tech startups led by women rises. In the future, this could lead to an increase in the proportion of female-led tech companies, female innovators and general inclusivity in tech and Web3 at an exponential rate rather than linearly. The new Web3 and tech frontiers highlight the critical role of women, whose active engagement encourages diversity, inclusivity and accessibility, in addition to offering opportunities for professional advancement, networking and financial inclusion for all.

Cointelegraph had the opportunity to speak with Dupler about the Academy\u2019s work on the ground with the Human Artistry Campaign and in state capitals advocating and defending artists\u2019 rights in light of AI. Since its emergence in the mainstream sphere, AI has become a major point of contention in the music industry. While some artists have keenly adopted and advocated for the technology, like electronic music artist Grimes, others have been sent into a frenzy over violations of intellectual property and the escalated emergence of deepfakes. Dupler said that of all the AI issues plaguing the creative community, the easiest to grasp is the idea of the AI-generated fakes. \u201cA lot of the AI issues are more complicated \u2014 more nuanced or legal ambiguity \u2014 but this one seems pretty clear that you shouldn\u2019t be able to take somebody\u2019s image, voice or likeness and use it without their permission.\u201d Many states in the United States have what is known as a \u201cright of publicity\u201d law, which protects artists from having their image or their name used to sell something or to promote something without their permission. Although most of these were written and implemented before the age of AI and don\u2019t cover the digital space or digital replicas. Dupler said the goal is to update this for the digital age, with Tennessee being a \u201cgreat place to start\u201d due to its strong right of publicity law, which was used by the Elvis Presley estate to protect his legacy and name. Related: AI resurrects Elvis Presley for comeback live performances \u201cWe did name the bill after Elvis, which really would be the first law of its kind that protects image, likeness and voice for artists and specifically in the context of digital replicas and AI.\u201d The Recording Academy executive said the organization has worked with the governor\u2019s office and stakeholders in the music community to craft the legislation and get the governor on board. He said it is optimistic that the bill will pass the full legislature and be signed into law. \u201cWe take nothing for granted,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is why we get out and do the work that we did. Now that it\u2019s cleared these committees, the next step would be for the bill to go to the floor of the Tennessee House and the Tennessee Senate for a full vote.\u201d Despite the controversy surrounding the topic, it has proved to be an issue uniting the music industry. Dupler said due to its diversity, it is difficult for the music community to get everyone aligned on the same page. \u201cWhat we have found is that when we do find that alignment and common ground, we\u2019re able to get great things done for the music community,\u201d he said. He pointed to two recent examples: the Music Modernization Act passed in 2018, which modernized music licensing laws for the first time in 20-plus years, and also the Save our Stages Act in 2020, which came as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the largest infusion of aid to the arts in U.S. history. \u201cTwo things back to back and different spaces, but places where the music community was able to come together to accomplish something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful in this context with AI particularly protecting likeness and voice and image, that we can do the same thing.\u201d Not only is the music industry coming together, but regulators across the political aisle. Dupler said it\u2019s rare when there is such bipartisan agreement around an issue. \u201cIt\u2019s always really hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen with Congress or with legislation. I don\u2019t know how long it will take for legislation to work its way through the process, but I think they know this is something they need to address.\u201d Politicians and political figures themselves are not exempt from the wrath of deepfakes. In January, deepfake scammers created a replica of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s voice, which they used in scam robocalls to dissuade voters from participating in a local election. If such legislation is not taken seriously, or worse not implemented in some capacity the implications can go beyond affecting a single artist. The ELVIS Act doesn\u2019t just protect creatives and public figures, but every citizen abiding under that law. \u201cThere is this sense of real personal violation when you see technology able to appropriate your image and voice and do things that you didn\u2019t do.\u201d Dupler pointed to the artist Lainey Wilson, who testified before members of Congress that her likeness was used to sell weight loss gummies that she was not involved in. \u201cShe takes seriously that she has young fans, girls that look up to her and take what she says very seriously and hang on to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she were being used to sell something that she didn\u2019t endorse, that could really mislead and distort how these fans look at her and what they might do.\u201d Nonetheless, he said the Recording Academy thinks \u201cAI has a lot of promise to democratize the creation of music, to make music available to more people. Maybe create new efficiencies or new creative ideas that we haven't even thought of yet, of ways people can create music.\u201d \u201cHowever, knowing how fast the technology moves we know we have to set up guardrails really quickly before it moves beyond a point where we can put those protections around it.\u201d A similar sentiment was echoed by the CEO of the Recording Academy, Harvey Mason Jr., in a 2023 interview with Cointelegraph on the topic who said that while needing the right regulations, AI has the potential to be a \u201ccreative amplifier.\u201d Magazine: BitCulture: Fine art on Solana, AI music, podcast + book reviews","tags":"#Music, #United States, #AI, #Artists, #Copyrights, #Intellectual Property"},{"date":"Mar 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"Ray Salmond","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/what-bitcoin-s-all-time-highs-mean-expectations-2024","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"What do Bitcoin\u2019s all-time highs mean for crypto industry expectations in 2024?","type":"Blog","category":"Podcast","content":"The long-awaited Bitcoin (BTC) price all-time high finally happened on March 5 after the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency rallied above $69,000. And there we have it. We are officially in a bull market. During the last bull market, developers, projects and artists all shared their lofty goals and ideas of how crypto and blockchain would revolutionize the entire world. While some of that happened, in reality, a lot was left unachieved. So, now that market conditions have finally improved, everyone has another chance at delivering on what was promised. The Agenda co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond\u2019s assumption is that with better market conditions and profitable balance sheets, blockchain projects should have sufficient runway to build the products and services that hope to solve a lot of the world\u2019s problems. On episode 31 of The Agenda, Salmond and DeYoung share their views on the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s price hitting a new all-time high and what this could mean for crypto in 2024. Once one gets past the excitement and fixation surrounding Bitcoin hitting new all-time price highs, a more contemplative mood sets in, wherein the significance of the milestone is considered. When asked about what BTC price going to the moon means in the larger scheme of things, Salmond suggested that it is \u201ca sign of maturity,\u201d especially considering that: \u201cThe ETFs are kind of like buyers of infinite demand, right? They\u2019re like purchasers of infinite demand. Every day for the last two or three weeks, they\u2019ve been buying $500 million minimum of Bitcoin daily, or $450 million daily. Even today, as Bitcoin price sold off after hitting a new all-time high, ETFs like IBIT from BlackRock traded like 1 billion shares.\u201d DeYoung expressed his perspective that, unlike previous bull markets, social chatter from non-crypto bros pales in comparison to what was seen in 2017 and 2020 and that he found himself somewhat surprised not to be looking at his portfolio value every five minutes: \u201cI\u2019m here for something deeper. So yeah, now that the price is back, I feel like I\u2019m a bit detached from that. And I also think that we\u2019re just \u2014 I mean, you can correct me if you disagree \u2014 but I feel like we\u2019re just still so early into this bull run that I feel like getting super hyped up about hitting $69,000 is a bit premature, I guess.\u201d Salmond and DeYoung agreed that in 2024, blockchain and crypto\u2019s success is more likely to be defined by builders\u2019 ability to deliver useful products and services instead of the value of their tokens. DeYoung said: \u201cI hope that it means that some of the people that are riding the wave up will then take some of their money and throw it into the more passion projects. Like they made their money with the [...] hype plays, maybe the bigger projects that make a little cash. Now they\u2019ve got an extra few ETH lying around, and they can throw it into their friend\u2019s passion project and help that get off the ground, or the kind of cool, unique use cases.\u201d DeYoung suggested that the synergy between crypto and artificial intelligence will continue to strengthen as the need to verify data and media becomes more necessary. According to DeYoung, blockchains seem perfectly purposed for cataloging and authenticating data, and he expects that they will play a critical role in media and possibly in government in the coming years. Related: Bitcoin accumulation phase ends as ETFs fuel new $100K BTC price target Salmond, on the other hand, is hopeful that music nonfungible tokens (NFTs) will become a trendy industry again in 2024: \u201cYou know, the market blew up two years ago. So, I thought the phoenix of NFTs would be music NFTs. I really thought that that was the one kind of subsector of the industry that made the most sense and would have the most growth \u2014 it would just be easy to kind of bridge between Web3, blockchain and the traditional music industry. And there were so many platforms and people that were fundraising to the tune of tens of millions of dollars for music NFTs that I\u2019m surprised nothing has happened.\u201d Salmond conceded that perhaps the timing of his high expectations lack patience, something that he explained is critical in the fintech space: \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned investing in Ethereum, Bitcoin maybe, but really Ethereum and some of the other, Ethereum-like coins \u2014 one thing I\u2019ve learned about tech companies is you don\u2019t expect results at the end of one year, or even at the end of two years, or even at the end of three years. You expect the payoff and the result at the end of five or 10 years. Like ETH is clearly a five-to-10-year investment.\u201d To hear more from Jonathan and Ray\u2019s conversation on The Agenda \u2014 including juicy details about upcoming episode guests \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The only blockchains surpassing Ethena\u2019s revenue were Tron, with $38.6 million, and Ethereum, with a $182.5 million daily cumulative revenue over the past seven days. Ethena currently offers a 67.2% yield on its USDe synthetic dollar to over 350,000 users, according to its homepage. The market cap of Ethena\u2019s USDe rose 43% over the past week and 409% over the past month to $840 million, according to DefiLlama data. Ethena Labs launched its USDe synthetic dollar on the public mainnet on Feb. 19. The launch caused widespread concern among investors, as the Ethereum-based synthetic dollar launched with a 27.6% annual percentage yield (APY), which i considerably higher than the 20% yield offered by Anchor Protocol on the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin before its collapse in May 2022. The initial concerns around USDe\u2019s yield are a sign of a maturing industry, recovering from the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, Guy Young, the founder of Ethena Labs, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on Feb. 22. \u201cThe immediate reference to Terra Luna was just a knee-jerk reaction which people had to the yield itself [\u2026] It\u2019s right that people responded in the way that they have because we should be responding with skepticism and trying to work out whether [protocols] are fragile in the beginning rather than letting them get too big if they are.\u201d Unlike the failed Anchor protocol, USDe\u2019s yield is publicly verifiable, as it is generated via staking returns and shorting Ether perpetual future contracts, Young told Cointelegraph. Ethena Labs secured $14 million in funding for its synthetic dollar, the team disclosed on Feb. 16. The round was backed by venture capital firm Dragonfly. The startup raised $6 million in an earlier round of investment in 2023, headlined by Binance Labs, Gemini, Bybit, Mirana Ventures, OKX Ventures and Deribit.

Optimism (OP) tokens are worth about $4.62 on the market, making the number of tokens sold worth around $90 million at the time of writing. While the foundation is offloading a large number of tokens, it mentioned in the announcement that the sale included a vesting period of two years, prohibiting the buyer from selling the tokens before then. Within the vesting period, the Optimism Foundation highlighted that the buyer can still use the tokens for governance participation. The foundation wrote: \u201cDuring the lock-up, the purchaser will be able to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for participation in governance.\u201d The organization also explained that the tokens were from an \u201cunallocated portion of the OP token treasury.\u201d The foundation said these assets are part of the organization\u2019s original working budget, which is 30% of the initial OP token supply.

Topper, a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp from Uphold, offers instant access, faster transactions, higher approval rates and a vast selection of cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency sector, characterized by both its enormous upside potential and the possibility of seamless, borderless transactions, presents compelling opportunities for everyday users. However, the process of converting fiat currency into cryptocurrency, facilitated by fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, often presents a significant barrier and can hinder the onboarding of new users. Most fiat on-ramps today only let you exchange fiat for a narrow selection of popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or stablecoins like Tether (USDT). As a result, users who want to diversify into other crypto need to find extra steps to get the desired cryptocurrency on the platform, resulting in frustration on the users\u2019 side due to poor experience. In addition to the complexities of fiat-to-crypto conversions, these transactions also suffer from low approval rates, with a staggering 50% failure rate across the industry. Whereas Topper, leveraging the infrastructure of Uphold, is able to offer approval rates exceeding 60%. Altogether, these inconveniences can deter new users from fully embracing the advantages of the crypto world, underscoring the need for more streamlined and user-friendly onboarding processes. The crypto industry urgently needs a fiat on-ramp designed for everyday users, one that offers easy fiat-to-crypto conversions using credit or debit cards, as well as Apple Pay and Google Pay, and direct access to a wider range of cryptocurrencies.

Aphone debuted in the Solana ecosystem on March 7 as a web-based virtual smartphone that gives users access to various Web3 and conventional applications. APhone ecosystem development and growth lead Jennifer Booze unpacked details of the service in correspondence with Cointelegraph following its launch. Aphone looks and feels like an Android smartphone and is platform-agnostic, meaning it can operate on a browser, Android or Apple device. Booze says it functions more like an operating system with its interface, features and underlying technology rather than replacing a device\u2019s operating system. \u201cIt\u2019s a cloud smartphone environment that users can access through their current devices, leveraging decentralized cloud computing to run Web3 applications smoothly without needing local hardware upgrades,\u201d Booze explains. The team envisions the virtual device as a means of onboarding users to Web3 applications and protocols previously hindered by the hardware limitations of devices. Related: Solana Saga fetches up to $5K on eBay as Bonk frenzy causes sell-out Aphone\u2019s service bypasses the hardware limits of older smartphone models by operating on a decentralized cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) computing infrastructure, Aethir. Aphone\u2019s interface and its applications run on the cloud service, which allows users to access apps and games that the physical device would not be able to handle. Booze said the virtual device\u2019s primary use case is to drive access to the broader Web3 ecosystem as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous in emerging markets alongside the proliferation of mobile internet access. \u201cBy leveraging Aethir\u2019s decentralized cloud technology, APhone enables these users to experience advanced Web3 applications, NFTs, DeFi platforms, blockchain games and run multiple smartphones on a single device.\u201d The virtual alternative to buying a new smartphone will cost users $20 a year. Prospective users can buy an Aphone nonfungible token (NFT), which is minted and burned on the Solana blockchain, giving users access to the virtual device. The device will also provide access to several decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) operating on Solana. This includes Helium, which rewards users for providing network coverage and validating transactions. Related: \u2018107,000 GPUs on the waitlist\u2019 \u2014 Io.net beta launch attracts data centers, GPU clusters Cointelegraph asked why Aphone needs to operate on blockchain infrastructure and the purpose of its native PHONE token. Booze said that operating on Solana offers high transaction speeds, lower costs and enhanced security and decentralization. \u201cThese features support a seamless Web3 experience, including managing NFTs, tokens, and accessing DApps. Aethir\u2019s infrastructure enables the powerful processing capabilities required for demanding Web3 applications, making the integration of blockchain technology essential for APhone\u2019s operation,\u201d Booze adds. The device\u2019s native token is set to be used for governance and rewards incentivization mechanisms to drive user engagement and participation. As Cointelegraph previously explored, DePINs are making their mark as resources to power artificial intelligence tools, which are becoming increasingly valuable. Recently developed DePIN platform IO.net will allow users to source GPU computing power for AI and machine learning, with Solana\u2019s blockchain used to process and facilitate millions of microtransactions to data centers and hardware providers.

In an X thread on March 7, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, hailed a \u201cnew chapter\u201d for the market. Bitcoin at all-time highs is a serious transformation from BTC price action just months ago, but on-chain analysis shows that bulls have simply redressed the balance. At around $70,000, Edwards shows, Bitcoin is \u201cfairly priced\u201d in terms of the amount of energy used by miners to participate in the network. Capriole\u2019s Bitcoin Energy Price metric shows the phenomenon playing out for the first time since late 2020. Edwards describes the metric as \u201cBitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value priced from the pure Joules of energy into the network only.\u201d \u201cNo wacky formulas, no power laws,\u201d he explained. \u201cEnergy alone maps the fair value of Bitcoin from inception. Currently at $70K, making Bitcoin fairly valued for the first time in 2 yrs.\u201d Energy price is just one example of an extensive list of market gauges that are now pointing toward even higher BTC prices. Even miners, currently selling significant amounts of BTC despite the upcoming block subsidy halving, are enjoying a return to solid profit margins. \u201cBitcoin broke out of the cost of production in recent months, along with the Ordinals fee boost, Bitcoin Mining is once again highly profitable,\u201d Edwards wrote. \u201cAs you can see, these breakouts often lead to repricing a lot higher. But the era of value Bitcoin is over.\u201d On that note, Edwards believes that those waiting for bargain Bitcoin buying opportunities have missed their opportunity. \u201cBitcoin deep value is gone. That ship has sailed. You had 2 years to pick up undervalued Bitcoin. Instead an exciting new chapter has begun,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWelcome to the Bitcoin Momentum era.\u201d As Cointelegraph continues to report, not everyone is feeling optimistic about what the immediate future holds.

Updating his view of how events could pan out in the coming few months, Venturefounder, a contributor to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, suggested that both Bitcoin and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), need to make a more definitive breach of current highs.

Lummis has been working jointly with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for several months on a bill aiming to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and protect investors, the U.S.-based news agency Axios reported on March 7. Citing several spokespeople for Lummis and Gillibrand\u2019s offices, the report notes that the senators hope to officially announce the news following encouraging feedback from multiple stakeholders. The New York Department of Financial Services, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the National Economic Council have provided technical assistance on the Senate bill, the report mentioned. For Lummis and Gillibrand, the work on stablecoin regulation would not be their first foray into drafting cryptocurrency-related legislation. In July 2013, the senators announced a joint effort to reintroduce legislation aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Lummis has emerged as a major pro-Bitcoin lawmaker in the U.S., advocating for Bitcoin multiple times. In October 2021, Lummis urged the U.S. government to \u201cthank God for Bitcoin\u201d amid U.S. President Joe Biden approving another raise of the country\u2019s debt limit. Lummis called on the U.S. government to take advantage of Bitcoin because it is decentralized and not controlled by any government. Lummis is also known for accumulating significant amounts of Bitcoin, buying BTC in batches of $50,000 and $100,000 in 2021. While bullish on Bitcoin, Lummis has grown skeptical about some major stablecoins recently, including Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and the most traded cryptocurrency at the time of writing. Related: UK regulations will allow stablecoins and CBDCs to coexist, says former BoE fintech lead In October 2023, Lummis backed a massive campaign against Tether, asking the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) to consider criminal charges against the stablecoin firm amid some reports alleging that it engaged in illicit financial transactions. Tether subsequently reacted to lawmakers\u2019 requests for DOJ action, claiming it wants to be a \u201cworld class partner\u201d to U.S. regulators. Most recently, Lummis has also been aggressively opposing central bank digital currencies, arguing that such digital currencies are \u201canti-democratic and a means of financial censorship.\u201d Magazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume","tags":"#Bitcoin, #Cryptocurrencies, #United States, #Tether, #Stablecoin, #Regulation"},{"date":"Mar 08, 2024","summary":"","author":"Yashu Gola","link":"https://cointelegraph.com//news/bitcoin-price-repeating-2020-breakout-90k-target","source":"https://cointelegraph.com/","title":"Is Bitcoin repeating its 2020 breakout? Here\u2019s why $92.5K might be the next target","type":"Blog","category":"Market Analysis","content":"Bitcoin (BTC) price looks ready to rally toward or above $90,000 in the coming weeks due to a mix of supportive technical, on-chain and fundamental indicators. BTC\u2019s price has entered a consolidation phase, moving sideways within a triangular formation resembling a bull pennant after achieving a new all-time high of $69,210. Notably, traditional analysts see bull pennants as bullish continuation patterns that could increase prices as much as the previous uptrend\u2019s height. This breakout typically accompanies an increase in trading volume. Bitcoin\u2019s chances of a breakout are currently considerable as the price consolidates, particularly after new all-time highs and other reasons discussed below. Thus, the next target could be around $92,500 in the coming weeks, up 35% from the current levels. Bitcoin\u2019s price uptrend in recent weeks has coincided with the increasing capital inflows into the United States-based exchange-traded funds (ETF). Notably, these ETFs hold over $53 billion in reserves as of March 7, compared to $27.95 billion at their launch in January. Higher inflows into an ETF suggest that more investors are buying shares of the ETF, which, in turn, increases demand for the underlying assets. This is because the fund manager may need to purchase additional assets to ensure the ETF accurately reflects the index composition or sector it tracks. \u201cIt appears that the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval launched an accumulation that, if sustained, puts BTC at $100K by October 2024,\u201d market analyst Timothy Peterson commented on X. Related: Is Tesla buying Bitcoin again? BTC wallet data sparks curiosity Moreover, the increasing ETF inflows come weeks ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Historically, halving events have been associated with increases in the price before (and after) the mining reward is cut in half. Bitcoin\u2019s current price action also closely resembles a historical fractal before its price rally toward $69,000 in November 2021, according to market analyst Jelle. These similar drawdowns around all-time high prices suggest that the next leg up might be just around the corner, like during the last bull cycle, albeit with some differences. \u201cBitcoin is acting similar to 2020\u2019s all-time high breakout,\u201d Jelle argues on X, adding: \u201cA failed breakout with sharp correction, then some consolidation, and a successful breakout higher.\u201d Should history repeat with a successful breakout higher, BTC price will be targeting prices north of $75,000.

In the study, the researchers identified the shortcomings of existing laws and presented their recommendations. On March 7, the U.K. government published an externally commissioned research report titled \u201cIP and Metaverse.\u201d The report dove into the existing literature on IP laws and how they can apply to the metaverse. Within the study, the researchers concluded that there are metaverse-specific IP issues, such as IP governance in an interoperable environment and regulating technologies like the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within virtual worlds. According to the report, many legal challenges come with interoperability, including the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted work. The researchers highlighted that the lack of interoperability has been important in preventing people from illegally distributing copyrighted material. With interoperability being a key feature in a metaverse, the researchers believe this could pose a challenge in governing the use and circulation of copyrighted work. Meanwhile, blockchain\u2019s inherent characteristics, such as immutability or being \u201ctamper-proof,\u201d also pose a challenge to enforcing IP laws. The researchers wrote: \u201cBlockchain\u2019s inherent resistance to change or correction undermines the ability to flexibly manage or update IP rights. This is an issue which becomes especially worrisome in the context of ownership disputes, as well as for navigating the termination of agreements and rights if licensors or rightholders seek to leave the Metaverse.\u201d However, AI use in the potential metaverse governance of IP also poses some anticipated challenges. The researchers argued that algorithmic management of infringements is \u201cextremely vulnerable to misuse\u201d because of the absence of human oversight to guarantee the legitimacy of enforcement. Related: Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment Apart from this, AI-generated content also brings up another challenge for IP enforcement in the metaverse. According to the study, reliance on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of inventorship in content. The research highlighted examples and cases that showed that \u201conly works partially assisted by AI\u201d are able to be protected by IP laws. Because of the anticipated issues in IP governance within the metaverse, the researchers concluded that there\u2019s a need for clarity on a \u201cplethora of key issues.\u201d This includes legal issues on copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the metaverse. Because of this, the researchers believed that it\u2019s necessary to formulate IP approaches for addressing governance and enforcement issues for a metaverse.

According to a March 7 update to the filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock wants to include physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), or in other words, spot Bitcoin ETFs, as part of MALOX. The updated filing notes that MALOX may purchase BlackRock\u2019s own spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), as well as ETFs by other issuers, stating: \u201cThe fund may acquire shares in ETPs that seek to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin by directly holding bitcoin \u2014 \u2018Bitcoin ETPs\u2019 \u2014 including shares of a Bitcoin ETP sponsored by an affiliate of BlackRock.\u201d The fund will only invest in Bitcoin ETPs that are listed and traded on national securities exchanges, the filing noted. Launched in 1989, the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund seeks to provide investment return through a fully managed investment policy utilizing U.S. and foreign equity, debt and money market securities, including companies like Microsoft, Apple and others. As of March 7, MALOX had $17.8 billion in assets under management. MALOX is not the only BlackRock fund that the company wants to hold spot Bitcoin ETFs. The updated SEC filing comes just a few days after BlackRock submitted a similar filing update for its Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX) on March 4.

At the time of writing, IBIT\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are worth $12.6 billion. In addition to the spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock has been actively pushing for a spot Ether (ETH) ETF with U.S. regulators. In November 2023, BlackRock filed a Form S-1 application for its iShares Ethereum Trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations. Industry analysts and observers have been arguing whether U.S. financial watchdogs would approve the launch of a spot ETH ETF in 2024. For Bitcoin, it took more than 10 years for the SEC to back a spot ETF in the United States.

In a March 6 filing, the SEC extended its time to respond to Cboe Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange on their bids to offer options on Bitcoin ETFs. It also delayed deciding on Nasdaq\u2019s bid to offer options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saying the delay ensures it has \u201csufficient time to consider\u201d its request. The exchanges all filed to list Bitcoin ETF options on Jan. 25, and the SEC faced its first decision deadline on March 10, as U.S. securities laws give it 45 days to decide or defer a decision on the matter.

If Bitcoin rises over the month, the trader could use their option, buy Bitcoin at the lower price, and maybe sell it for a profit.

The rising popularity of generative AI spurred niche crypto sub-ecosystems over the last couple of years. However, Coinbase research analyst David Han believes that the rapid changes in AI \u201cmake us cautious\u201d of the long-term sustainability of most AI tokens. One of the primary challenges with crypto AI projects lies within the core of both technologies. While crypto projects often aim for decentralization, the current AI offering relies heavily on centralized components and data sources, argues Han. In addition, most projects in the niche have failed to attract investors \u2014 resulting in under-indexed capital allocation. The report highlights two opportunities for the crypto AI ecosystem \u2014 improving the blockchain data for creating human-readable transactions and analysis and helping decentralize the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han said: \u201cA decentralized AI future, as it is currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed \u2014 in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.\u201d Despite the negative outlook, many AI tokens haverecently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributed this to the market sentiment built by the broader crypto market and supported by related AI news headlines. The crypto AI narrative could grow even stronger amid the continued constructive crypto market and the outperforming AI sector. However, Coinbase suggests that driving \u201cmeaningful adoption\u201d will require more than just decentralizing AI components. It is important to note that the AI ecosystem is currently in its nascency and will have to \u201cunderstand the underlying trading narrative\u201d at the very least, eventually providing a comparable alternative to today\u2019s crypto assets.
