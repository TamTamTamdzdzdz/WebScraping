One of the key highlights of the zero-shot prompting examples is the fact that you do not have to use explicit examples for desired output from the LLM. Zero-shot prompting does not require labeled data and enables the model to address a new issue. LLMs could adapt to unprecedented issues as they could understand content sourced from different platforms. Here are some of the basic examples for understanding how zero-shot prompting works. The first example of zero-shot learning involves a simple prompt such as, Translate the following sentence from English into Spanish. The text could be something like, \u201cThe landscape looks amazing.\u201d The output would be, \u201cEl paisaje se ve increíble.\u201d Let us assume another task as an example for understanding the working mechanism of zero-shot prompting. Here is an example of a zero-shot prompt for summarizing text. Summarize the main concept in the following text in one line. The text for such zero-shot prompting examples could look like the following paragraph. The sporadic rise of artificial intelligence has fuelled major advancements across different industries. AI technology has emerged as a promising choice for improving the productivity of different industries, such as education, healthcare, and manufacturing. On top of it, AI has also introduced innovative advancements that have improved our everyday lives. However, it also presents some critical concerns, such as privacy issues and the loss of jobs to automation. The output of the LLM for the prompt would be like, The rapid growth of AI technology has introduced positive effects in different industries, albeit with concerns regarding privacy and job loss. In the examples, you can notice that the model has received clear instructions without any examples or demonstration of desired behavior. The zero-shot learning capabilities of the large language model help it in understanding the task and generating the relevant output in both examples. On the other hand, it is important to note that zero-shot prompting does not deliver accurate results in all cases. However, a few-shot approach for prompting the language model could overcome the limitation by providing examples or demonstrations to LLMs. What is Few-shot Prompting? The next important technique among zero-shot and few-shot prompting serves as an effective answer for overcoming the limitations of zero-shot prompting. It helps large language models in ensuring better performance for complex tasks by offering demonstrations. On the other hand, it has problems in addressing tasks that require reasoning. In such cases, prompt engineers would have to turn towards advanced prompt engineering techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting. At the same time, zero-shot and few-shot prompting examples show that few-shot learning can offer a more effective alternative to zero-shot training. It can utilize different numbers of examples, such as one-shot, three-shot, or five-shot learning. The examples for few-shot learning include input-output pairs that guide the LLM in generating desired responses. However, few-shot learning also has certain limitations. Examples of Few-shot Prompting The review of few-shot prompting examples would help in understanding the working mechanisms of few-shot learning. Few-shot learning involves in-context learning through the use of examples that help in conditioning the behavior of the LLM. Here are some of the notable examples of few-shot learning. Prompt 1: Whatpus are small, furry animals found in Tanzania. Output: We saw whatpus during our vacation in Africa. Prompt 2: Farduddle means jumping up and down vigorously. Output: We could not help but farduddle upon hearing the news of victory. In both examples, the LLM could learn the ideal approach for performing the desired task with the help of one example. Therefore, the prompting approach in this case would be one-shot learning. The following example could help you understand how zero-shot and few-shot prompting are different from each other. The example revolves around the use of random labels for sentiment analysis tasks. Here is an example of the prompt. This is great! // Negative This is sad! // Positive Wow, that movie was amazing! // Positive What a big letdown! // The output for the sentiment analysis task prompt would be negative. You can notice that the randomization of labels does not generate the correct answer for the model. At the same time, you could also notice the significance of format in few-shot learning examples. The answers to \u201cWhat is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompts?\u201d point to the fact that few-shot learning could address complex tasks. On the other hand, few-shot learning also struggles to complete tasks that need complex reasoning. Let us assume that you use the following prompt. The odd numbers in this collection add up to create an even number: 32, 13, 15, 82, 7, 5, and 1. The response of the LLM for this prompt might be, Yes, the odd numbers in the collection add up to 110, which is an even number. As you can notice, the response of the LLM is completely inaccurate, thereby suggesting that few-shot prompting could not deal with such problems. You can also try adding more examples to guide the behavior of the LLM. However, it might not stand up to the challenge of generating relevant responses in complex reasoning tasks. At the same time, the examples show that few-shot learning could help in improving the performance of LLMs for different tasks. On the other hand, you might need advanced techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, to address complex tasks. What are the Differences between Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompting? The next important point of concern on your mind right now must be the difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning. You must have checked the zero-shot and few-shot prompting examples to understand the fundamental differences between them. For example, you might have understood that zero-shot prompting does not require any explicit examples of desired behavior. On the other hand, few-shot prompting requires some examples to describe the specific behavior of the LLM. Here are some of the notable differences between zero-shot and few-shot learning. Zero-shot learning is a prompting technique for helping a model make the necessary predictions for unseen data without the need for additional training. On the contrary, few-shot learning uses a small set of task-specific or niche data for fine-tuning the performance of a model. Zero-shot models do not require task-specific training data as they can depend on pre-trained knowledge alongside reasoning abilities. Few-shot models would need a limited amount of task-specific training data, generally in the form of certain labeled examples. The answers to \u201cWhat is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompts?\u201d would also point to the element of control. In zero-shot prompting, the model relies on pre-trained knowledge, thereby reducing control over the output. On the other hand, few-shot prompting can help in refining LLMs with specific training data or examples that improve customization and control. Another crucial aspect is the differences between zero-shot prompting and few-shot learning points at training time. Zero-shot learning offers the assurance of faster training time without the need for model optimization. On the other hand, few-shot learning requires longer training times, albeit with faster prompting than training models from scratch. Zero-shot prompting can help LLMs achieve higher flexibility as they can manage a broad range of tasks without additional training. Few-shot learning offers moderate flexibility as the method needs task-centric data and can adapt to different tasks only with niche examples. The review of zero-shot prompting examples also shows that it is useful in scenarios where the model does not have specific training data or requires rapid experimentation. On the other hand, few-shot learning is ideal for use cases that require task-specific customization or have limited training data. The distinctive trait of zero-shot prompting is the assurance of faster response generation, as the model could use pre-trained knowledge for generating outputs. On the other hand, few-shot prompting involves the fine-tuning process, which leads to a comparatively lower speed of generating responses. When Should You Use a Few-shot Prompting Technique? The differences between zero-shot and few-shot prompting show that few-shot learning is ideal for complex tasks. It is useful in cases where zero-shot prompting does not deliver the desired results. In addition, few-shot learning is also recommended for use cases with limited training data. Some of the notable use cases of few-shot learning include natural language understanding, summarization, code generation, question answering, domain-specific tasks, creative writing, and conversational AI. Few-shot learning can also support tasks such as structured output generation, customized visualization and reporting, and data extraction and formatting. Conclusion The outline of zero-shot and few-shot prompting examples alongside the distinctive highlights of each prompting method shows their importance. It is important to understand that zero-shot prompting examples could not showcase effectiveness in dealing with complex tasks. At the same time, few-shot learning also falters in the case of complex reasoning tasks. However, a few-shot approach to prompting can ensure customized training of LLMs for specific tasks through fine-tuning. On the other hand, zero-shot prompting could offer the advantage of adaptability for unknown use cases. The differences between zero-shot and few-shot learning in terms of usability, training duration, flexibility, and control over output prove that both techniques have unique advantages and setbacks.

AI systems have become an integral aspect of the world of technology with a formidable impact on different sectors and jobs. One of the most crucial changes introduced by artificial intelligence is the way in which people interact with technology. However, different types of AI bias could lead to unpredictable consequences. As a matter of fact, many users have pointed out concerns about the adoption of AI due to the issues of bias. Could AI bias stop the adoption of AI? Machine learning and AI are revolutionary technologies and could change the future of mankind with promising improvements. At the same time, it is also important to mitigate any potential harm emerging from the use of AI. Let us learn more about bias in AI systems and their variants, alongside the recommended methods for fighting against AI bias.  Definition of AI Bias The first highlight in answers to \u201cWhat is AI Bias?\u201d would point towards the capability of AI systems for transforming the use of technology. Until a few years ago, artificial intelligence was just a topic you would come across in science-fiction novels or films. However, the futuristic concept has turned into reality and has transformed different aspects of our daily lives. In addition, AI systems have also emerged as crucial tools for introducing major transformations in different industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, and retail industry. The benefits of AI systems should not overshadow the inherent risks associated with artificial intelligence. You should understand that an AI bias guide could help you identify how bias could affect the working of artificial intelligence. AI systems work by replicating the human thought process, and AI systems could also bring human biases in decision-making. The impact of AI bias is visible in different use cases, such as facial recognition, risk assessment, and chatbot interactions. Bias in AI systems could have a negative impact on businesses, individuals, and society. AI bias is also known as machine learning bias or algorithm bias. The bias in AI systems refers to a phenomenon in which the algorithm used in decision-making features systematic errors that are derived from preconceived stereotypes and notions. The review of AI bias examples would help you understand that AI bias is almost similar to human biases and leads to inaccuracy of decisions. AI biases emerge when AI algorithms draw narrow conclusions or use training datasets that do not offer an accurate representation of the concerned population. Impact of AI Bias The next crucial factor you need to learn to prevent AI bias would be the impact of AI bias. You can notice the impact of AI bias in different ways, including subtle changes to large-scale errors or false assumptions. For instance, societal bias against women could lead to the development of AI systems that would favor male candidates over female candidates in making hiring decisions. On the other hand, cognitive bias against women with darker skin tones in the healthcare industry could lead to development of AI systems that would create diagnosis issues for women with darker skin tones. As a matter of fact, certain studies have reported that AI facial analysis techniques could have a higher misidentification rate in the cases of people with dark skin tones. A study by the Stanford University Human-Centered AI Institute showed that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training or CLIP model resulted in misclassification of people with dark skin tones. It serves as one of the earliest examples of AI bias, which shows the impact of racial bias in AI-based facial recognition systems. It is important to understand that such types of bias could be problematic in the era of increasing diversity and representation. For example, racial bias could have a negative impact on people from minority groups. What are the Popular Types of AI Bias? Bias in artificial intelligence could assume multiple forms and could be difficult to identify. You can find two broad categories of AI bias such as algorithmic bias and data bias, with unique implications. The first entry among the types of AI bias is algorithmic bias, which emerges when AI algorithms generate incorrect or unfair results due to the incorrect assumptions or underlying datasets used for training the algorithm. Algorithmic bias could arise in situations when the data used for training the algorithm features biases. For example, if a training dataset emphasizes a specific demographic group, it would not consider other populations. As a result, the AI algorithm would generate results that could reflect the biases in the training dataset. Therefore, it would change the balance of fairness in the algorithm. Another popular addition to an AI bias guide would point at data bias. It is a type of bias that emerges when training datasets for AI algorithms have biases or errors. Data bias could emerge from different sources, such as data cleaning process, data collection methods, and inherent biases associated with source data. For example, you can assume that a dataset for training AI systems to draw predictions for customer behavior could have an over-representation of specific ethnicities or genders. In the case of data bias, AI algorithms would lead to results that favor certain groups. How Does AI Bias Affect Different Industries? Artificial Intelligence has become a popular technology trend and influences different aspects of the lives of people. Therefore, AI technology should be unbiased and fair. The answers to \u201cWhat is AI bias?\u201d point to the real-world implications of biased AI, including unfair treatment of groups or individuals or generating inaccurate decisions or predictions. AI systems could be beneficial to society and introduce powerful changes. However, it is important to understand the pros and cons of AI for ensuring effective use of AI systems, especially with the different biases. Here is an outline of the different ways in which AI bias could affect different industries. Organizations in the education sector utilize AI for making decisions about admissions of students in schools, colleges, and universities. However, AI bias examples in the education sector could show that biased decision-making could lead to unfair exclusion of students. For instance, an AI algorithm could use a training dataset with biases for a specific race or gender. In such cases, the AI system could turn the results of the admission process in favor of the concerned groups. Have you ever wondered how you find the results on search engines? AI algorithms are responsible for determining the news articles that you would see on your screen. In such cases, AI algorithms could prioritize news articles that skew towards certain biases and result in biased news that does not represent the population. The best recommendation to prevent AI bias would point to the example of AI\u2019s impact on financial services. Artificial intelligence has become an important component in transforming financial services, such as helping firms make decisions about credit ratings and loan approvals. When the algorithm used for decision-making in financial services has societal biases, it could lead to unwanted circumstances. For example, an AI algorithm for passing loan approvals could use a dataset featuring data from samples with white people. The AI algorithm could lead to unfair loan denials for people with darker skin tones. The different types of AI bias could also influence law enforcement, primarily due to biases in facial recognition technology. Biased AI in facial analysis technology could result in false positives that could lead to wrongful accusations and arrests. It is a particularly complicated problem for people of darker skin tones who are commonly implicated in arrests and are a major percentage of the prison population. Popular Instances of AI Bias The bias associated with AI systems has created multiple issues in the real world. It is important to learn about examples of AI bias and their implications for people and different industries. Here are some of the notable instances of the concerns emerging from AI bias. AI technology could help in reducing health inequalities, especially at a time when a country like the US has been experiencing problems with systematic racism. AI systems that have been trained on datasets that do not represent the actual state of healthcare could perform negatively for underrepresented populations. According to a 2019 study, researchers discovered that AI algorithms for predicting which patients need additional medical care could be influenced by bias. For example, the algorithms prioritized white patients over black patients. The AI algorithm emphasizes individual healthcare needs for determining healthcare expenses. However, the algorithm assumed that past healthcare expenditures could help in determining its effectiveness. Automation has been one of the key factors in the domain of ecommerce, and Amazon has leveraged automation for its own interests. Interestingly, the answers to \u201cWhat is AI bias?\u201d would draw attention to the experimental recruitment tool with AI functionalities. It was designed for assigning ratings to job applicants. However, the AI algorithm was biased towards women and called for changes in the algorithm. The computer models of Amazon have been working on analyzing resumes for almost a decade and could identify similarities in the candidate applications. Most of the applications were from males and reflected the male dominance in the industry. The AI algorithm learned that all applications should be from males, and thus, it penalized resumes from female applicants. Amazon made the programs to become completely neutral. How Can You Resolve Biases in AI? The necessity to prevent AI bias has become an important highlight in the AI ecosystem. If you want to make the best of AI systems, then you must familiarize yourself with the following best practices to resolve AI bias. Real-world data might appear as a trusted and credible source of information for training AI models. At the same time, it is also important to verify that real-world data could include unintentional societal and human biases. You should not rely completely on real-world data for training datasets of AI algorithms. On the other hand, you should utilize a blend of real-world and synthetic data. It would ensure that the training dataset is completely accurate and unbiased. AI algorithms can be extremely complex, and it is difficult to identify biases without a comprehensive understanding of dataset and working mechanism of the algorithm. Any AI bias guide could help you understand that AI algorithms can be fair only if they are transparent. AI algorithms should provide a clear explanation of the decision-making process underlying their design. In addition, an organization should also offer an explanation of the mechanisms used for making decisions with responsible AI algorithms. The best approach for preventing bias visible in real-world examples of AI algorithms involves the use of human beings and computers in unison. For instance, if a machine cannot solve the issue, then humans should contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, the system would create a continuous feedback loop that would learn and improve continuously with every iteration. Subsequently, human-in-the-loop could help in ensuring accurate datasets that could lead to better precision and safety. Another notable approach for resolving different types of AI bias involves consistent testing of AI and ML models. Regular testing of AI and machine learning models ensures that AI algorithms can mitigate bias and ensure accuracy. Furthermore, you should also compare the results of the AI algorithm to the algorithms designed by humans. It can help ensure that the algorithm makes fair decisions. Conclusion The review of different examples of AI bias has shown that AI systems can improve and make accurate decisions. You should note that AI bias can be a major problem for effectiveness of AI algorithms. The impact of AI on real-world use cases could lead to negative sentiment around adoption of AI. However, a comprehensive understanding of different types of biases in AI and effective ways for mitigation of the biases. For instance, you should use a mix of real-world and synthetic data for training AI models to ensure fairness. Learn more about the best practices for preparing AI models to fight against bias.

Generative text involves making predictions of the words that will follow to form a sentence. In layman\u2019s language generative text helps in predicting which word will be written after another word in a sentence. In the technology-driven era, you come across generative text almost everywhere, such as chatbots and word or sentence auto-corrections. Moreover, you may also come across them while performing grammar checks. Undoubtedly, today, generative text has become part and parcel of one\u2019s daily life. Read on to find the answer to \u2013 What Is Syntactic Analysis NLP? Syntactic analysis basically refers to the process of examining natural language by applying the rules of formal grammar. By using grammatical rules for categories and groups of words, it is possible to allocate semantic structure to texts. However, you must bear in mind that grammar rules are not applicable to single words. In generative text, syntactic analysis helps in analyzing words to check for grammar and show the association. If you want to master Natural Language Processing, you must learn Syntactic Analysis NLP.  Fundamentals of Syntactic Analysis When it comes to Natural Language Processing, syntax plays a cardinal role. This is because it serves as a roadmap for computer systems to comprehend as well as generate human language. Syntactic Analysis in NLP encompasses fragmenting sentences into their grammatical elements. For example, sentences may be broken down into their grammar components, such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Thus, it enables machines to understand the structure as well as the meaning of the texts. You can familiarize yourself with the basics of the concept with the help of the Syntactic Analysis NLP guide. The syntactic analysis, which is also known as parsing, is responsible for assigning a semantic structure to a given text. The assigning of a logical structure is possible by applying the rules of formal grammar in the context of natural language. You can refer to Syntactic Analysis NLP examples to improve your clarity on the subject. Here is a simple example for your understanding! The sentence \u2018Class go to a girl\u2019 fails to make any sense. It does not have any logical meaning. Moreover, the grammatical structure of the sentence is also not accurate. In this scenario, syntactic analysis will tell us that the particular sentence has no rational or logical meaning. Similarly, it can also tell whether the grammatical structure of a sentence is right or wrong. Purpose of Syntactic Analysis The fundamental purpose of syntactic analysis is to derive meaning from a text. In the analysis, checks are in place so that texts which are not meaningful or which do not make sense can be rejected. By analyzing a string of symbols by using formal grammar as the guide, Syntactic Analysis In NLP carries out its function. Syntactic analysis aids in understanding the structure relating to the input text. The analysis is done at an in-depth level starting from the basic symbols to all the way to an entire sentence. This technique enables it to determine whether a text has any logical meaning or not. The concept is of critical importance since it enables machines to understand human language. It plays an instrumental role in bridging the gap between humans and systems. Diverse types of Syntactic Structures Before diving further into the realm of Syntactic Analysis In NLP, you must understand different types of syntactic structures. Syntactic structures consist of a number of elements, such as phrases, clauses, constituency relations, and dependency relations. Phrases refer to a group of words that operate together as a single component within a sentence. Common terms encompass verb phrases as well as noun phrases. Clauses consist of a subject along with a predicate. Hence, clauses are larger or wider units that are used in language. Clauses may be independent, also known as main clauses, or dependent clauses, also known as subordinate clauses. Constituency grammar is responsible for breaking sentences into constituents like verb and noun phrases. The purpose of the breakdown is to capture the constituents that shed light on the syntax structure of sentences. In the case of dependency grammar, there exists a link between the words of sentences. The link is the dependency relation, which reveals how words in sentences depend on one another. The role of dependency relations is of high relevance in syntactic analysis. This is because they help in capturing the syntactic associations between words. Key Syntactic Analysis Approaches The Syntactic Analysis In NLP makes use of diverse approaches for performing the dissection of grammar structure in language. You need to familiarize yourself with these approaches to strengthen your grip on syntactic analysis. The syntactic analysis approaches present a foundation for the comprehension of how words and phrases in sentences are linked with one another. Some of the chief syntactic analysis approaches include: Under this approach, context-free grammar is a conventional method. It acts as a useful method in the syntactic analysis domain. It involves a series of rules that capture how the combination of varying components of a sentence takes place. The context-free grammar rule assists in generating parse trees representing a sentence\u2019s syntactic structure. Dependency grammar is another approach that focuses on the associations that exist between the words of sentences. A unique feature is that instead of creating hierarchical structures, it uses direct links. These links between words showcase which words rely on or depend on others in a sentence. This approach is useful in the case of languages that have a relatively free word order. Under the statistical approaches, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) is a common method. PCFG basically uses context-free grammar. This is done by assigning probabilities to every production rule. The probabilities are responsible for reflecting the likelihood for a specific rule to be applicable in specific scenarios. This method is common when it comes to statistical parsing. It helps in finding a sentence\u2019s syntax structure, which has the highest likelihood. Transition-based parsing is another method under the statistical approaches category. It involves the deployment of machine learning techniques for incrementally creating a parse tree. This is done by making decisions at each and every step. In this approach, the use of a series of activities is essential for constructing the ultimate parse tree. Transition-based parsing is highly effective and valuable when it comes to real-time applications. The common neural network-based approaches in syntactic analysis involve recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models. Each of these methods has different attributes that you must familiarize yourself with before knowing their application. The recurrent neural networks process sequences or series of words. Moreover, they maintain a hidden state which is responsible for capturing contextual information. A specific syntactic analysis task where RNN has high relevance is part-of-speech tagging. However, a key limitation of RNN is the sequential processing attribute, which limits its capabilities. Moreover, recurrent neural networks struggle when it comes to long-range dependencies. Convolutional neural networks are able to capture local patterns that may exist in the input. Due to this characteristic, CNN is suitable for the purpose of extracting syntactic associations between closely placed words. For performing dependency parching, the CNN method is applicable. The common transformer models that have been revolutionizing Natural Language Processing are GPT and BERT. You must already be familiar with these elements and how they are transforming the role of NLP for one and all. These models are capable of capturing local as well as global syntactic information. Due to their robust capabilities, they are seen as state-of-the-art tools of the current era. Some of the syntactic analysis tasks for which these models are ideal include dependency parsing and constituency parsing. Now that you have a better understanding of key syntactic analysis approaches, you know their relevance. However, you must keep in mind that each approach has its unique strengths as well as limitations. So, you need to make the choice of the approach wisely by taking into consideration the task and the capabilities of the approaches. Parsing Algorithms In syntactic analysis, the term parsing refers to the fundamental process of breaking down a sentence. By breaking the sentence into smaller fragments, it is possible to view their grammar components. Furthermore, it is possible to represent them in the form of a parse tree or a dependency graph. Over the years, a diverse range of parsing algorithms have come into existence for performing the specific task. In syntactic analysis, some of the common parsing algorithms are top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing, chart parsing, and shift-reduce parsing. Top-down parsing is also known as recursive descent parsing. It begins with the highest-level syntactic structure. Then, the structure is broken down into tinier constituents in a recursive manner. This parsing method initiates from the top-level grammar rule, and as it moves further, the lower-level rules are applicable. In case a rule is not applicable, then the parser retracts and considers different possibilities. The backtracking or retracting feature is the main limitation of top-down parsing. Just as the name suggests, bottom-up parsing is the opposite of the top-down parsing method. In bottom-up parsing, the parsing begins with single or individual words. The construction of the parse tree is possible through the bottom-up approach. In other words, the tress formation takes place by combining words in a successive manner to form more significant elements. A common example of the bottom-up parsing mechanism is shift-reducing parsing. In this method, progress is made by shifting words to a stack from the input. When the rule has been satisfied, they are reduced. Chart parsing is a dynamic method that is suitable for ambiguous or unclear grammar. It is capable of creating a chart data structure for storing and combining partial parse trees in an effective manner. In chart parsing, the application of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) or Earley parser algorithm is common for context-free grammars. One of the main highlights of chart phasing is that they are capable of handling ambiguity. Importantly, they are able to give a diverse range of parses for a single sentence. As a result, chart parsing is of immense value when it comes to natural languages which have complex syntax structures. The application of shift-reduce parsing is common in the case of dependency parsing with the objective of forming a dependency tree. A unique feature of shift-reduce parsing is that the parser maintains a series of actions along with a stack of words. The grammar rule serves as the ultimate guide on the basis of which the shifting of words takes place. It is a highly efficient method that is capable of handling non-projective syntax structures. Although other parsing may struggle to deal with them, the shift-reduce parsing algorithm may be able to effortlessly work with non-projective syntax structures. In the context of syntactic analysis, the relevance of parsing algorithms is high. These algorithms basically enable NLP to make sense of the structure of different sentences. Additionally, they also aid in extracting grammar information and recognizing relationships between words. Conclusion In NLP, the role of syntactic analysis is indispensable. It acts as the ultimate medium that helps to understand the logical meaning of sentences or certain parts of sentences. Without performing syntactic analysis, machines might fail to understand human language. The application of formal grammar rules in the Natural Language Processing context makes the analysis possible. In the Syntactic Analysis NLP guide, you have come across diverse concepts such as syntactic structures and syntactic analysis approaches. A solid and comprehensive understanding of syntactic analysis is instrumental in applying it effectively in the practical setting.

When you go to your workplace, you choose the shorter route to eliminate traffic hassles. Similarly, you might book a cab in advance while going to attend an important meeting. These examples show that humans look for ways to optimize certain things to make our lives easier. Now that you are aware of optimization, the concept of gradient descent will be much easier to comprehend. In the context of machine learning, gradient descent refers to an iterative process that is responsible for locating a function\u2019s minima. Do you still have the question \u2013 What Is a Gradient Descent ML? The answer is gradient descent is an optimization algorithm. The gradient descent in the machine learning realm is essential as it helps in updating parameters in a model. As gradient descent refers to the cornerstone in the vast arena of machine learning, it is essential to learn about it at an in-depth level. At the very core, it is the algorithm that aids in finding optimal parameters, including biases and weights of a neural network. The objective of Gradient Descent in Machine Learning is to decrease a cost function to the maximum extent. It is a common algorithm that has relevance for training machine learning models by diminishing errors between the expected and actual outcomes. Gradient descent acts as the chief tool to optimize learning models. Once you meet the optimization objective, you can use these models as powerful components in Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, you can also use these models in diverse other applications. The Gradient Descent ML guide will help you understand gradient descent, its types, and associated challenges.  Insight into cost function Before diving further into the domain of gradient descent, you need to familiarize yourself with the concept of cost function. A cost function in Gradient Descent Machine Learning context refers to the measurement of error or variance between actual and expected values. The role of a cost function is important since it helps in improving the efficiency of machine learning. The enhancement of efficiency is possible because feedback is available to the model to help keep a tab on errors. In addition to this, the cost function iterates along the path of the negative gradient until it approaches zero value. Types of Gradient Descent Gradient descent algorithms are of three types, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. An understanding of each of the types is essential as it can guide you to apply them effectively. The insight into different types of gradient descent algorithms can assist you while working on varying Gradient Descent projects. The batch gradient descent is the simplest or most basic variant of gradient descent. It is also known as the vanilla gradient descent. In such a gradient descent, the entire training dataset is used for computing the cost function\u2019s gradient. Moreover, the computation is done with regard to the parameters of the model in every iteration. This Gradient Descent Machine Learning may be computationally costly in the case of large datasets. However, the batch gradient descent can undoubtedly guarantee the convergence to the local minimum relating to the cost function. In batch gradient descent, the update of the model takes place only after the evaluation of every training example. An important advantage of batch gradient descent is the high computational efficiency. Without a doubt, the technique has low computational requirements. The lack of need for any updates after every sample contributes to its efficiency. It results in the generation of a stable convergence as well as a stable error gradient. Stochastic gradient descent is another important type of gradient descent that is highly relevant and useful for optimization purposes. The specific variant of gradient descent helps in resolving computational inefficiencies relating to conventional gradient descent mechanisms in large datasets. A unique attribute of the gradient descent is that instead of utilizing the whole dataset, a random training example is chosen. The computing of the gradient is done using the random training example. Similarly, this random element is used for making updates to the parameters of the machine learning model. The randomization feature allows the generalization of models. A major benefit of the stochastic gradient descent variant is its high efficiency, even in the case of large datasets. By using a single training example that is randomly chosen, it is possible to curb computational costs for each iteration. This is because, unlike traditional gradient descent methods, the processing of the entire dataset is not compulsory. While comparing stochastic gradient descent with batch gradient descent, the former is able to converge at a faster rate than the latter. The mini-batch gradient descent is another variant that fuses the concepts from batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. In this case, the training dataset is split into two different and smaller batches. In each of the batches, specific updates are made. A key highlight of the variant is that it helps to strike a balance between the two gradient descent categories. Due to the unique approach, in this type of machine learning gradient descent, it is possible to bring symmetry between speed as well as computational efficiency. The crossover between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent helps to derive the benefits of each of the variants. A chief advantage of mini-batch gradient descent is that it is capable of simultaneously processing varying data points. This dimension relating to parallelism amplifies gradient computation as well as updates in parameters. Hence it results in faster and efficient convergence. While working on diverse Gradient Descent projects, insight into its different variants is essential. A solid understanding in this regard can help you make the optimum use of gradient descent algorithms. Each of the types of gradient descent algorithms has its distinguishing attributes and features. To ensure the optimization of models, you need to expand your comprehension of the different gradient descent variants. How does Gradient Descent work? The gradient descent is able to numerically estimate the point at which the output of a function is at its lowest. The cost function that exists within the gradient descent serves as a vital instrument capable of gauging the accuracy with each iteration. The optimization algorithm is able to iteratively make adjustments to the parameters in the direction of a negative gradient. The fundamental objective of making the adjustments is to find the optimum or ideal set of parameters in a model. The gradient descent algorithm works by computing the gradient of the cost function. The gradient of the cost function is indicative of the magnitude as well as the direction of the steepest slope. Since the fundamental purpose of the optimization algorithm is to diminish the cost function, the gradient descent shifts in the opposite direction of the gradient. It is the negative gradient direction. By repeatedly updating the parameters of a model in the negative gradient direction, it is possible to male convergence toward optimum parameters. There is a diverse range of areas where gradient descent algorithms are of high relevance and usefulness. Some of the common machine learning algorithms where the optimization algorithms make a valuable contribution are neural networks and logistic regression. Additionally, Gradient Descent ML examples are common in other areas, such as linear regression and support vector machines. Challenges involved in Gradient Descent It is a fact that the gradient descent algorithm acts as a robust algorithm that boosts optimization. However, it is essential to take into account the challenges and concerns that arise while using the gradient descent algorithm. In order to get a comprehensive insight into Gradient Descent In Machine Learning, you must be aware of the challenges. One of the fundamental challenges that arises in the context of gradient descent revolves around overfitting. There is a possibility that the optimization algorithm may overfit the training dataset. This possibility mainly arises in case the learning rate is excessively high or the model is overly complex in nature. In case such a challenge arises in Gradient Descent Machine Learning, it may result in inefficient generalization performance. Challenges relating to the local optima A serious challenge that may arise while using gradient descent is the possibility of converging to local optima. In case there exist multiple valleys and peaks in the cost function, there is a chance for the algorithm to converge to local optima instead of the global optima. The role of the learning rate is of paramount importance while using a gradient descent algorithm in the machine learning realm. The selection of the learning rate may impact the overall performance of the optimization algorithm. In case the learning rate is extremely high, there is a probability that the gradient descent may overshoot the minimum. Similarly, if the learning rate is excessively low, there is a possibility that the gradient descent may take a long time to converge. Either way, the optimization function will have an impact in the end. The rate of convergence of the gradient descent algorithm may become slow in the case of large datasets. Similarly, the convergence rate may also be slow in case there exists high-dimensional spaces. Regardless of the exact reason for the high convergence rate, the optimization algorithm will become expensive for computation purposes. In the deep learning realm, saddle point refers to the spot where a function\u2019s gradients may entirely vanish. The surprising thing is that this may happen in a location that is neither a local minimum nor a global minimum. When it comes to high-dimensional spaces, there is a chance that gradients relating to cost functions may have saddle points. It may ultimately result in the ineffectiveness of the gradient descent algorithm. There is a probability that the optimization algorithm may remain in an upland, and convergence may not be possible. There are several challenges relating to gradient descent that you need to know. You need to update your knowledge about such challenges and concern areas so that appropriate measures can be taken. If you are feeling overwhelmed after learning about the challenges, there is no need to worry. The good news is that numerous variations of gradient descent have emerged in recent years. The purpose of the new variations of gradient descent algorithm is to help overcome obstacles and challenges. Some of the common types of gradient descent variations are momentum-based methods, second-order methods, and adaptive learning rate methods. You need to broaden your knowledge and understanding of each of these variations. By having a solid insight into these areas, you will be able to work on a diverse range of Gradient Descent projects efficiently.

The guides on artificial neural networks draw similarities with biological neurons. You can find multiple similarities in the structure and functions between artificial neurons and biological neurons. Here are the prominent aspects on which you can compare artificial neurons with biological neurons. The first thing you would notice in a comparison between artificial neurons and biological neurons in an artificial neural networks tutorial points at the structure. Artificial neurons have been modeled after biological neurons. Biological neurons have a cell body for processing the impulses, dendrites for receiving impulses, and axons for transferring impulses to other neurons. On the other hand, input nodes in artificial neural networks receive the input signals while the hidden layer processes the input signals. The output layer leverages activation functions for processing the results of the hidden layer to generate the final output. The responses to \u201cWhat is artificial neural networks?\u201d also point to the comparison of synapses in ANNs and biological neurons. Synapses serve as the link between biological neurons for transmitting impulses from the dendrites to the cell body. In the case of artificial neurons, synapses are the weights that connect one-layer nodes to the next-layer nodes. The weight value helps in determining the strength of the links. Another crucial aspect for comparing artificial neurons with biological neurons points to activation. In the case of biological neurons, activation refers to the firing rate of neurons for strong impulses that can reach the threshold. On the contrary, activation in artificial neurons points to an activation function that facilitates mapping of inputs to outputs, followed by executing activations. You can also evaluate the effectiveness of artificial neural network algorithm against the human brain by considering the element of learning. Learning in biological neurons takes place in the nucleus of the cell body, which helps in processing the impulses. The impulse processing stage leads to generation of an action potential, which travels through axons for powerful impulses. The transfer of impulses is possible due to the ability of synapses to change their strength according to modifications in activity. On the other hand, artificial neural networks utilize back-propagation techniques for learning. It involves adjustment of weights between the nodes on the basis of errors or discrepancies between desired and actual outputs. Architecture of Artificial Neural Networks Now that you know about the ways in which artificial neurons are related to biological neurons, you should learn about the architecture of ANNs. You can learn artificial neural networks by exploring the functionalities of different layers in their architecture. The architecture of artificial neural networks includes three layers such as the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. The input layer is the foremost layer in an artificial neural network. It works on receiving the input information from external sources. The input data could be available in the form of text, numbers, images, or audio files. The middle layer of artificial neural networks includes the hidden layers. You could find one or multiple hidden layers in ANNs. The hidden layer in an artificial neural network example serves as a distillation layer. It works on extracting the relevant patterns from input data and transfers them to the next layer for analysis. It can help accelerate and improve the efficiency of the artificial neural network by identifying only the most important patterns from the input. As a result, the hidden layer serves as the ideal choice for performing different types of mathematical computation tasks on input data. The output layer focuses primarily on obtaining the results on the basis of rigorous mathematical computations by the hidden layer. Another crucial aspect in the explanation of artificial neural network definition points to the use of parameters and hyperparameters. The parameters and hyperparameters are responsible for influencing the performance of the neural network. As a matter of fact, the output of artificial neural networks depends on these parameters. Some of the notable examples of parameters for ANNs include weights, batch size, biases, and learning rate. It is important to note that every node in the ANN has some weight. Artificial neural networks utilize a transfer function for determining the weighted sum of inputs alongside the bias. Once the transfer function completes calculation of the sum, the activation function will generate the result. The activation functions would trigger execution according to the received output. Examples of popular activation functions for ANNs include Softmax, Sigmoid, and RELU. What is Back-propagation in Artificial Neural Networks? ANNs generate the final output value by using activation functions. In addition, the working of an artificial neural network algorithm would also involve error functions. The error functions can help in calculating the differences between the desired and actual output for adjusting the weights of the neural network. The process of adjusting weights is back-propagation. The training process of artificial neural networks involves providing examples of input-output mappings. For example, you can teach an ANN to recognize a dog. First of all, you have to show thousands of images of dogs to help the ANN in identifying a dog. After training the artificial neural network example with multiple images of dogs, you should check whether it can identify dogs in an image. You can achieve this by classification of images to help in deciding whether a specific image includes a dog. The output of the ANN is then checked against a human description of whether the image has a dog in it. In the case of incorrect responses by the ANN, you have to use back-propagation to adjust the weights learned in the training process. The process of back-propagation focuses on fine-tuning the weights of connections in ANN units according to the error rate. Subsequently, the process must continue iteratively until the ANN successfully recognizes an image with a dog in it.

In such types of ANN, the input data travels in a single direction and exits through the output layer. Feedforward neural networks may or may not have hidden layers and do not rely on back-propagation. Modular neural networks include a collection of multiple neural networks working independently to achieve the output. The different neural networks perform a unique sub-task with unique inputs. The advantage of modular neural networks is the ability to reduce complexity by breaking down complex and large computational processes. Recurrent neural networks are also a common addition to artificial neural networks tutorial among the variants of ANNs. The recurrent neural networks work by saving the output of a layer and feeding back the output to the input to provide better predictions for outcomes of the layer. Convolutional neural networks share some similarities with feedforward neural networks. However, convoluted neural networks have one or multiple convolutional layers that utilize a convolution operation for the input before passing the result. Convolutional neural networks can find promising applications in the field of speech and image processing. Radial basis functions are also another prominent example of artificial neural network algorithm variants. The radial basis functions work by accounting for the distance of a point with respect to the center. Radial basis functions feature two distinct layers which have distinct functionalities. Such types of neural networks also use radial basis function nets for modeling data that could represent underlying functions or trends. What are the Prominent Examples of Artificial Neural Networks?

It works by simulating human intelligence through neural networks. The neural networks are developed with nodes that are similar to neurons that are the fundamental units of the human brain. At this point of time, questions like \u2018What is transfer learning?\u2019 also invite attention to the emerging trends in the field of machine learning. Is it different from machine learning and deep learning? What does transfer learning help you achieve? Neural networks help in developing deep learning models and use unstructured data from which the deep learning models can extract features by iterative training. However, the iterative process of training a neural network on large datasets could take a lot of time. The first thing you would learn in a transfer learning tutorial is the fact that transfer learning can help reduce the time required for training neural networks. It is a promising technique for natural language processing and image classification tasks. Let us learn more about transfer learning and its significance in deep learning.  Definition of Transfer Learning The best way to understand the importance of transfer learning in deep learning focuses on the definition of transfer learning. In simple words, it is the process of reusing a pre-trained model for solving a new problem. As of now, it is one of the most popular terms in the domain of deep learning as it could help in training deep neural networks with little data. Transfer learning is important in the field of data science as most real-world problems do not have numerous labeled data points for training complex models. The basic transfer learning example would show that knowledge about a trained machine learning model could be applied to a related issue. For example, you can have a simple classifier for predicting whether an image includes a backpack. Now, you can use the knowledge gained by the model during the training process to recognize other objects. The process of transfer learning involves exploiting the knowledge gained in one task to improve generalization for another task. In other words, transfer learning involves transferring weights learned by a network at \u2018Task A\u2019 to a new task known as \u2018Task B.\u2019 The general idea behind transfer learning models is the use of knowledge that a model has learned from a particular task with lots of labeled training data. The model uses the knowledge for a new task that does not have significant data. Rather than implementing the learning process from scratch, you can use the patterns learned through solving related tasks. Transfer learning is primarily used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, which require more computational power. Variants of Transfer Learning The definition of transfer learning creates curiosity about the types of transfer learning and how they differ from each other. The variants of transfer learning are different on the grounds of three distinctive factors. First of all, you must think about what should be transferred and the approaches and timing for transferring training data. The difference between different variants of transfer learning emerges from the fact that the source dataset and target dataset in the transfer learning settings could vary for different domains or different tasks. The top examples in a transfer learning tutorial would point to inductive learning, unsupervised learning, and transductive learning. Inductive learning focuses on different tasks, irrespective of the similarities between target and source domains. Unsupervised learning is the recommended transfer learning approach when you don\u2019t have labeled data for training. Transductive learning would be useful in situations where the tasks are almost the same, albeit with differences in the marginal probability distributions or feature spaces between domains. Working Mechanism of Transfer Learning The next crucial highlight in the domain of transfer learning would point to the working mechanism. In the domain of computer vision, neural networks work by detecting edges in the first layers, followed by shapes in middle layer and task-specific features in the last layers. On the other hand, guides on \u201cWhat is transfer learning?\u201d show that only the first and middle layers are used. You would have to work on retraining the latter layers, which would help in leveraging the labeled data of the task that it was trained for. You can assume an example of a model that could help in recognizing a backpack in an image, which would be used for identifying sunglasses. In the first layers, the model has already learned the approach for recognizing objects. Therefore, you would have to focus only on retraining the last layers so that the model could recognize the aspects that would distinguish sunglasses from other objects. Transfer learning works by transferring as much knowledge as you can from the previous task that the model was trained for to the new task. The knowledge could be available in different forms, according to the problem and the concerned data. For example, the knowledge could describe the approaches for composing the model, which could help in identifying new objects with ease. What are the Reasons for Using Transfer Learning? The importance of transfer learning in deep learning draws attention to the different benefits. However, the primary advantages of transfer learning points at saving training time and better performance with neural networks. In addition, you should also notice that you would not need a lot of data. Generally, you would need a lot of data for training a neural network. However, you could not access the data in all cases. Transfer learning helps a lot in such cases. You can use transfer learning for building a formidable machine learning model with comparatively fewer data as the model has been pre-trained. Transfer learning is useful for natural language processing as you would need expert knowledge for creating large labeled datasets. In addition, it can also help in reducing the training time, as you could need data or weeks for training deep neural networks from scratch for complex tasks. The advantages of transfer learning models also point to the assurance of achieving accuracy. Most important of all, transfer learning is useful in cases where you don\u2019t have the computing resources required for training a model. Where Can\u2019t You Use Transfer Learning? The most critical aspect in the field of transfer learning points to the scenarios where you can\u2019t use it. For example, transfer learning is not useful for situations where high-level features learned in the bottom layers are not useful for differentiating the classes in the problem. Pre-trained models could show exceptional results in identifying a door, albeit with difficulties in identifying whether it is open or closed. Such a transfer learning example shows that you can use the low-level features rather than the high-level features. You would have to retrain other layers of the model alongside using features from previous layers. In the case of dissimilar datasets, the transfer of features is significantly poor. You could also come across situations where you have to remove some layers from pre-trained models. The impact of different types of transfer learning shows that it would not work in use cases where you have to remove some layers. Removing layers could reduce the number of trainable parameters, thereby leading to overfitting. On top of it, identifying the ideal number of layers that you can remove without overfitting could be a time-consuming and challenging process. Where Should You Implement Transfer Learning? In the domain of machine learning, you would have to experience challenges in forming generally applicable rules. However, the applications of transfer learning in deep learning would have to abide by certain guidelines. Here are the recommended scenarios where you can use transfer learning. The different types of scenarios where you can use transfer learning provide a better explanation of usability of transfer learning. In addition, you should also consider situations where the original model uses an open-source library like TensorFlow for training. In such cases, you could restore the model and then retrain some of the layers to achieve your desired tasks. At the same time, the transfer learning example must also focus on the fact that transfer learning is useful only if the features of learning the first task are general in nature. On top of it, you should also note that the input of the model should be the same size as the data used for training it. If you don\u2019t have the same, then you can introduce a pre-processing step for resizing the input to the required size. How Can You Implement Transfer Learning? You might have some doubts about implementing transfer learning after learning about its advantages. After identifying the right use cases for transfer learning, you can learn about the important steps for implementing transfer learning. You can use transfer learning by using the following steps.  The first step in the transfer learning process focuses on returning to the fundamentals of transfer learning. You learn the different answers to \u201cWhat is transfer learning?\u201d and find its different advantages. What is the basic premise of transfer learning? You take a pre-trained model and retrain it for a new, similar task. Therefore, you can begin the transfer learning process by choosing a pre-trained model suited to your problem.

LLMs are powerful algorithms trained for identifying patterns in language structure and the context of their applications. Large language models have become one of the most powerful components in the world of AI right now. For example, LLMs have become the foundations for chatbots, content creation, language translation, and virtual assistant applications. Let us learn about the fundamentals of LLMs and how they work in the following post.  What are Large Language Models? Large Language Models, or LLMs, are machine learning models which have been trained using massive volumes of datasets with text data. The models could work on classification and summarization of text and generating new text. Some of the notable Large Language Models examples include GPT-4 by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and PaLM 2 by Google. Prior to the arrival of ChatGPT, some of the popular LLMs were BERT and GPT-3. The ability of large language models is visible in their outputs, which have better fluency and coherence rather than a random collection of words. LLMs could help users with a wide range of NLP tasks, such as code development and debugging, content summarization, translation, chatbots, and copywriting. LLMs are similar to language prediction models in terms of their working. If you want to learn large language models, then you should know that the models help in predicting the next word in a sequence. LLMs take prompts as inputs from the users or instructions for the algorithms. The models help in generating text one by one on the basis of statistical analysis of all the tokens they used during the training process. However, organizations have been doubtful about the practices for adopting LLMs. While many organizations claim that they have been working on projects with generative models, only a few of them implement LLMs in production. What could be the possible issues affecting the adoption of LLMs? One of the examples points to the lack of technical infrastructure, and some cases might involve a lack of awareness regarding LLMs. Working Mechanism of Large Language Models The next big highlight in an LLM tutorial would point at the working mechanisms of large language models. One of the first things you would find in the working of large language models is the transformer model. The design of a transformer model can help you learn about the working of large language models. Transformer models feature a decoder and an encoder and work on data processing through the tokenization of inputs. At the same time, LLMs also conduct mathematical equations to discover the relationship between different tokens. Transformer models help a computer in viewing patterns like a human. The models utilize self-attention mechanisms and help the model in faster learning than traditional models like the long short-term memory models. Self-attention mechanisms help the transformer model in evaluating the different parts of a sequence of words or the complete context of sentences for generating predictions. Important Components in LLM Architecture The review of the working of large language models or LLMs also focuses on their architecture. An outline of the large language models explained for beginners would involve an explanation of their architecture, including multiple neural network layers. The three important layers in the LLM architecture include recurrent layers, embedding layers, attention layers, and feed-forward layers. All the layers work in unison with each other to process the input text and generate the desired output according to the prompts. Here is an overview of the functions of each layer in the architecture of LLM. The embedding layer is responsible for generating embeddings from input text. An embedding layer of LLMs helps in capturing the semantic as well as syntactic meaning of the input, thereby helping the model understand context. The feedforward layer is another notable addition among responses to \u201cWhat is the basics of LLM?\u201d with its unique role in LLM architecture. Feedforward layer in a large language model features different layers with comprehensive interconnection for transforming the input embeddings. During the process, the layers help models in learning high-level abstractions, which contribute to understanding user intent in inputs. The final layer in the architecture of LLMs is the recurrent layer. It works on interpretation of words in the input text sequence. It could effectively capture the association between different words in the sequence of words in user prompts. The outline of answers for \u201cWhat is large language models?\u201d also focuses on the importance of the attention mechanism. LLMs utilize the attention mechanism for focusing on individual parts in the input text which are relevant to the concerned task. The self-attention mechanism layer helps the model in generating outputs with better accuracy. Types of Large Language Models Before moving further into the details about how LLMs work, it is important to learn about the variants. Any LLM tutorial would showcase the three distinct types of large language models, such as generic language models, instruction-tuned models, and dialog-tuned language models. Let us find out the functionalities of each type of large language model. The generic or raw language models work on prediction of the next word according to language within the training data. Generic language models are useful for performing information retrieval tasks. Instruction-tuned language models rely on training for predicting responses to instructions specified in the input. The instruction-tuned language models could perform tasks such as sentiment analysis and generation of text or code. Dialog-turned-language models use training to predict the next response in interaction with users. The examples of AI chatbots or conversational AI showcase details about the working of how dialog-tuned language models. In-depth Explanation of the Working of Transformer Model All of you know that transformer models serve as the primary driving force behind the working of LLMs. The transformer models work by taking an input, encoding the input, and decoding it for generating output predictions. However, the fundamentals of large language models explained the necessity of training the model before encoding and decoding. The training helps the large language model in addressing general tasks while fine-tuning enables the LLMs to perform specific tasks. Let us take a look at the three important steps which define the working of transformer models in LLMs. Large language models rely on pre-training with large text-based datasets from different sources such as Github, Wikipedia, and others. The datasets feature trillions of words, and the quality of datasets would have a major impact on the performance of language models. A review of answers to \u201cWhat is the basics of LLM?\u201d would help you learn the significance of training process for LLMs. During the training process, the LLM works on unsupervised learning. As a result, the model could process the input datasets without the need for specific instructions. In addition, the AI algorithm of the LLM could learn about the meaning of words and relationship between the words. Furthermore, the training process also helps the model learn about distinguishing words according to context. For example, it would understand whether bold means \u2018brave\u2019 or a method of emphasizing words and letters. Fine-tuning is another important highlight in the working of LLMs. You can learn large language models and uncover their potential for managing specific tasks involving natural language. For example, LLMs could help in performing language translations. Therefore, it is important to fine-tune the LLM for the concerned activity. On top of it, fine-tuning helps in optimizing LLMs to achieve desired performance in specific tasks. For instance, LLMs can be fine-tuned to achieve a specific degree of accuracy in natural language translations. Another significant aspect in the working of transformer models in LLMs draws attention toward prompt-tuning. It works like fine-tuning for training a model to work on a specific task by using zero-shot prompting or few-shot prompting. Prompts are the instructions provided as inputs to the LLMs. You can refer to certain large language models examples for identifying how prompts work. Few-shot prompting trains the model for predicting outputs by using examples. Let us take an example of a sentiment analysis task to understand the working of a few-shot prompt. If the review of a customer states, \u201cThis product offers better value for money,\u201d you could identify positive customer sentiment. On the other hand, if the review states, \u201cThis product is a waste of time,\u201d then you can identify the negative customer sentiment. The language model would understand the semantic meaning of \u2018waste of time,\u2019 and the opposite example provided to the language model leads to \u2018negative\u2019 customer sentiment in the second example. On the other hand, zero-shot prompting does not use such examples for teaching language models about responding to inputs. It changes the question to \u201cThe customer sentiment in \u2018This product offers better value for money\u2019 is\u2026\u201d and provides the task that a model should perform. Without any problem-solving examples, the question tells the language model about the tasks it should perform. Benefits of Large Language Models The review of a guide on \u201cWhat is large language models?\u201d would be incomplete without an outline of the advantages of LLMs. Large language models can serve as valuable assets for companies that generate massive volumes of data.

You can come across multiple use cases of AI, including chatbots and virtual assistants. However, the implementation of artificial intelligence in project management has been gaining significant popularity. Artificial intelligence is an indispensable tool for businesses seeking improvements in efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, it is also important to learn about usability of AI in the domain of project management. Let us learn more about the significance of artificial intelligence for project management in the following post.  Fundamental Concepts of Artificial Intelligence Before you find the different ways to implement AI in project management, you must learn about AI itself.

However, you need something more than \u2018following the trend\u2019 to validate the use of artificial intelligence in project management. For starters, AI has the power to revolutionize the future of project management with the obvious benefits of reduced costs and improved efficiency. The annual investment in projects worldwide amounts to almost $48 trillion. On the other hand, only 35% of the projects initiated every year could taste success. The remaining 65% of projects end up wasting a massive share of resources invested in project management alongside losing out on important benefits. Continuous efforts for introducing modernization in project management rely on these limitations in existing project management workflows. The support of AI project management tools could help in resolving multiple setbacks which plague the current project management systems. As a matter of fact, one of the formidable reasons for lower project success rates points to the lack of maturity in technologies available for project management. For example, project managers still use slides, spreadsheets, and other conventional applications for project management. The conventional tools had served their job to perfection during a time when organizations measured project success through deliverables and compliance with deadlines. However, the modern project management landscape features consistently changing objectives alongside continuous transformation of businesses. Irrespective of the advancements in project portfolio management applications, the lack of automation and \u2018smart\u2019 features affects project management outcomes. Value of Artificial Intelligence for Project Management The thought of adopting AI for project management brings many conflicts to the equation. For example, organizations are likely to implement a cost-benefit analysis to identify whether AI could help them. Interestingly, it is important to note how applications of AI or other technological innovations in project management could improve success rate of projects by almost 25%. The 25% improvement could lead to trillions of dollars in benefits and value advantages for organizations, individuals, and societies. However, the most pressing concerns revolve around the effective implementation of AI to project management. Gartner has brought some positive news in this context. It has been estimated that AI will power almost 80% of project management tasks by 2030. Project management tasks would also involve the support of big data, natural language processing, and machine learning. Researchers and an increasing number of startups have also been working on developing algorithms for implementing AI and ML in project management.

Artificial intelligence could serve as the support required to make project management systems more efficient. Developments in artificial intelligence offer easier access to opportunities, unlike any other technology. Businesses and project managers who are prepared for the moment of disruption are most likely to reap the rewards. The introduction of AI would disrupt different areas of project management, including planning, people, and processes. Let us take a better look at the effect of artificial intelligence on project management. Project managers have been experiencing different types of problems with automation.

AI could help in identifying the nature of datasets and point out abnormalities in the project data. AI project management tools could help in reading and analyzing information at a faster rate while ensuring accuracy. Therefore, AI can help in identifying the projects that are ready for launch with higher probabilities of success. The value of better selection and prioritization could help in driving risk management by determining the chances of success. Another important implication of using AI in project management points to the freedom from human bias in decision-making with AI. Ultimately, project managers could find effective ways to improve projects before launching them alongside ensuring better chances of success. The effect of AI on the future of project management also emphasizes the freedom from burden of daily tasks and administrative setbacks. Automation has emerged as one of the formidable solutions for speeding up administrative processes with simple processes. However, the applications of artificial intelligence could make the process more manageable and streamlined. Data analytics and automation firms have been serving valuable solutions that help in redefining the significance of the project management office.

The discussions about what is the future of AI in the domain of project management showcase the potential of AI in supporting project managers with everyday tasks. AI systems could provide efficient monitoring of progress in a project alongside ensuring compliance monitoring for policies and processes. Artificial intelligence also offers the capability for identifying potential problems and resolving them automatically. On top of it, AI could also support automation of processes for preparing and distributing project reports and feedback collection. The importance of AI for project management is also visible in the assurance of better sophistication in selection of project management methodologies for every project. Most important of all, project managers can leverage the power of automation through virtual assistants to improve specific support functions.

Some of the questions, such as \u201cIs AI the future?\u201d point to the role of project management automation with AI in addressing risk management. Innovative AI systems help project managers anticipate risks that would have remained unnoticed. The new applications could help in proposing actions for mitigating risks. In addition, the functionalities of AI and ML could help in automatic adjustment of plans for avoiding specific risks.

Automated reporting not only reduces labor requirements but also utilizes real-time data. Furthermore, AI-based reporting tools could also dig deeper and provide more insights than conventional project management tools. For example, the AI reporting tools can showcase potential slippage, project status, team sentiment, and benefits achieved in the project. The influence of AI on project management techniques and tools focuses profoundly on automation. One of the most important entries among the implications of AI on the future of project management point to the support of better testing systems and software.

On the other hand, AI could ensure availability of project testing tools to all companies. AI-based testing could help project managers determine the suitable cost, weaknesses, opportunities, and strengths. As a result, AI could play a vital role in determining decisions in managerial and budgeting aspects for a project. The advantages of AI for project management show that AI could introduce promising value advantages for project managers. On the other hand, artificial intelligence also presents some limitations in project management use cases. For example, the high costs and ethical concerns of implementing artificial intelligence in project management need a comprehensive review.

What are the importance of ethics in AI and the important pillars of ethical AI? How will ethical AI encourage the adoption of AI, and what are the challenges for ethical AI? Let us find the answers to these questions with a detailed introduction to ethics of AI. Background of Artificial Intelligence Discussions about ethics have been one of the most prominent aspects of development of human civilization. Research on the ethics of artificial intelligence and robotics is essential for avoiding the consequences of AI misuse. Have you seen the movie \u201cI Robot\u201d or the \u201cTerminator\u201d movie franchise? Many other films and television shows have depicted different possible scenarios in which AI and robots could harm humanity. On the contrary, Asimov\u2019s Laws of Robotics suggest that robots or AI should never harm humanity or cause harm due to inaction. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that helps in replicating human intelligence in computers through complex algorithms. Machines powered by AI algorithms could perform complicated tasks with better efficiency alongside tasks that require decision-making abilities and logic. However, the potential of AI also draws attention to importance of ethics in artificial intelligence as it can be used for malicious acts. The questions about ethical AI reflect on the possibilities of AI replacing human workers and similar issues popularized in the media. On the other hand, it is important to look for other pressing concerns, such as transparency, lack of regulations, and data longevity. What are the Ethical Concerns in AI? The ideal approach to learning about the different types of ethics in AI would involve a review of the ethical issues in AI. Discussions about the ethical issues of AI refer to the problems emerging in interactions between humanity and AI. On top of it, you should also know how AI could influence the future of consumers.

Imagine an unauthorized AI program gaining access to data on a computer it should not have accessed in the first place. You can find answers to \u201cWhy are ethics important in AI?\u201d with respect to traceability with two specific actions. First of all, it is important to ensure that AI is explainable. On the other hand, it should also help other stakeholders in understanding the working mechanisms of AI. The rising popularity of AI has raised questions about the ways in which it could replace the jobs of humans. However, AI would generate more jobs than it would replace. At the same time, it is important to consider the types of jobs AI would replace, such as data entry and assembly jobs. Therefore, businesses must ensure upskilling and reskilling of their workforce to help them adapt to changes due to AI. Either way, artificial intelligence would still take away the jobs of millions of people. One of the common aspects in the ethics of artificial intelligence and robotics that remains unnoticed is consumer privacy. It is a major concern for experts as data collected by AI and for AI could persist far longer than the companies using the data. Major tech companies, businesses, and governments collect consumer data irrespective of privacy rights. What are the ethical concerns of AI with respect to consumer privacy? The notable answers apart from data persistence include data repurposing and data spillover. Data repurposing refers to the use of data originally collected for one purpose for another purpose without the knowledge of an individual. On the other hand, data spillover implies a collection of data about other individuals without their consent through data collected from a single individual with their consent. The most prominent ethical issue with artificial intelligence is the possibility of bias and discrimination. One of the most common misconceptions about AI is that it cannot be biased as it is a machine. However, AI could be unbiased only when the data used for training is unbiased. The review of different types of ethics in AI points to the inaccuracies in data collected by businesses from data warehouses. You can find two distinct types of bias in AI: data bias and societal bias. Data bias refers to the bias or flaws in training data used for creating AI, which leads to introduction of same biases in the resulting AI program. Societal bias refers to the biases in society that are programmed into AI due to programmer oversight. On the other hand, AI could also learn societal bias through independent data collection. Who are the Stakeholders in Ethical AI? The development of ethical principles to create responsible AI and use it in responsible ways would need the efforts of multiple stakeholders.

The technologies help recognize patterns in massive datasets, followed by using historical data to predict future outcomes. However, the vision for creating \u2018smart\u2019 machines would rely on the ability of computer systems to learn independently without intervention. At this point of time, a deep learning tutorial becomes an important necessity as it helps in understanding the approaches for the simulation of human intelligence in machines through neural networks. Most of you might be wondering about the definition of deep learning and how neural networks work. The following post offers you a detailed introduction to deep learning and its working mechanisms alongside use cases.  Definition of Deep Learning Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence like machine learning. The answers to \u2018what is deep learning\u2019 can offer you the foundation-level knowledge required for understanding the value of deep learning. It works by imitating the ways followed by humans to gain knowledge. Deep learning models are trained for performing classification tasks and recognizing patterns in different data types, such as audio, text, and image files. On top of it, deep learning models can also help in the automation of tasks, which traditionally required human intelligence. For example, deep learning is useful for the transcription of audio files or for describing images. One of the interesting highlights in the fundamentals of deep learning explained for beginners would showcase the relationship between data science and deep learning. Deep learning can help data scientists collect, analyze, and interpret large volumes of data with simplicity and ease. You must know that human brains have millions of neurons connected to each other and help in learning information. Deep learning follows the same approach and utilizes neural networks as an alternative to the network of neurons. The neural networks are created with multiple layers of nodes that work in unison to achieve the desired objectives. The training process of deep learning models involves large collections of labeled data alongside neural network architectures. You can refer to deep learning examples to identify how deep learning could help computers in learning by example. For instance, a model would learn by classifying objects to differentiate one object from another. Gradually, the model would learn about the features of the object and develops clarity regarding complex abstractions. Working Mechanism of Deep Learning Deep learning works through continuous learning. The answers for \u2018How does deep learning work\u2019 would focus on the multiple layers of interconnected nodes in deep learning. Every layer builds on the last layer for refining and optimizing the predictions alongside classification tasks. Deep learning models implement non-linear transformations for the input values and uses the inferences for developing the statistical model as the output. The process would continue in an iterative manner until the output achieves the desired accuracy level. Since the data in deep learning algorithms must pass through different processing layers, the term \u2018deep\u2019 fits perfectly for them. In the case of conventional machine learning, the models are trained through supervised learning. Furthermore, the programmer should offer specific instructions to the computer about the things it should look for in input data. The process is known as feature extraction, and the computer system\u2019s success rate depends on the programmer\u2019s ability to define feature sets. With deep learning models, the program would develop the feature set independently without any intervention or supervision. The first step in training deep learning algorithms involves the facility of training data. Let us reflect on the working of deep learning for learning whether images contain the photo of dogs or not. The input data in this example would include a collection of images featuring metatags for easier classification. The program utilizes the information from training data to create a feature set for dogs and developing a predictive model. In the first stage, the model could predict that any object in the image with four legs and a tail could be classified as a dog. Over the course of time, the model would search for patterns of pixels in the input data without any labels. As the iteration continues, the predictive model will achieve better accuracy and become more complex. How is Deep Learning Different? Compared to machine learning or humans, deep learning algorithms could accurately present predictions within a few minutes. You can improve the deep learning workflow by introducing massive volumes of training data into the equation. At the same time, it is also important to note that deep learning utilizes massive amounts of computing power. The arrival of big data and cloud computing provided the two essential requirements for growth of deep learning. Another distinct highlight of deep learning is the fact that it creates complex statistical models from its iterative output. As a result, deep learning algorithms could develop more accurate predictive models by utilizing large amounts of unstructured and unlabeled data. What are the Different Types of Methods for Deep Learning? The working mechanisms of deep learning and its distinct highlights showcase that it has the potential to introduce revolutionary changes in computing. Interestingly, the answers for \u2018what is deep learning\u2019 do not emphasize the types of deep learning methods for creating strong models. Here is an outline of some of the notable techniques employed in deep learning. Transfer learning is one of the most common methods for training deep learning models. The transfer learning process focuses on improving a model which has been trained already. At the same time, the process would need an interface to the internals in a pre-trained network. The first step involves feeding new data to the existing network. The new data must feature classifications that are previously unknown to the network. After introducing the necessary modifications in the network, the network can help in performing new tasks with better specificity in its classification abilities. The transfer learning method for deep learning ensures lesser data consumption as compared to others, thereby reducing the computation time. The next addition among the methods for deep learning explained for beginners would point at the dropout. It focuses on resolving the concerns of overfitting in networks that have many parameters. The dropout method involves randomly excluding units alongside their connections to the neural network in the training process. The dropout method could help increase the performance of neural networks compared to supervised learning for different tasks. For example, dropout could help in offering better results in computational biology, speech recognition, and document classification. The learning rate is an important parameter in the training process for deep learning models. It helps in defining the system alongside the set of conditions for its operations before the learning process. As a result, the learning rate could exercise the model changes due to estimated error for every instance of modifying model weights. The learning rate decay method is one of the notable aspects in responses to \u2018how does deep learning work\u2019 as it helps in increasing performance. Higher learning rates could lead to unstable training processes or learning with a suboptimal collection of weights. On the other hand, smaller learning rates could lead to lengthy training processes, which are more likely to experience downtime. The learning rate decay or adaptive learning rate method involves adapting the learning rate to reduce training time alongside increasing performance.

However, the training process with such methods could take days or weeks as it needs massive data. What are Neural Networks in Deep Learning? Artificial Neural Networks or ANNs are a variant of advanced machine learning algorithm that defines the foundations of the majority of deep learning models. Therefore, deep learning has also been classified as deep neural networks or deep neural learning. The working of deep learning depends on neural networks as they help in avoiding the need for programming. The Deep learning networks include three layers: the input layer, the output layer, and the hidden layer. Each layer of the neural network serves a distinct functionality for deep learning. Input layers serve as the layer for placing input data. You can find different variations in a number of output layers and nodes according to the desired output. For example, you would need only two nodes in the deep learning workflow for yes/no outputs. On the other hand, outputs with additional information would need more nodes. The final layer, i.e., the hidden layer, serves as the intermediary layer, which works on processing data and transferring it to different layers in the network. You can come across different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, forward neural networks, and convolutional networks. Every neural network offers the assurance of benefits in specific use cases. At the same time, all the neural networks follow a similar approach in their working mechanisms. All of them feed data and wait for the model to determine whether they have made the right decision for a specific data element. The outline of responses for \u2018what is deep learning\u2019 would be incomplete without referring to the trial-and-error approach for training. Neural networks rely on the trial-and-error method, thereby implying the requirement of massive volumes of data for training. You must also note that neural networks gained significant popularity after businesses adopted big data analytics and collected large volumes of data. The fundamental concepts of deep learning explained the importance of neural networks, albeit without referring to the type of data required for training. Which type of data is ideal for neural networks? You must note that the first few iterations of the deep learning model involve guesses. Therefore, the training process must use labeled data to help the model determine the accuracy of its responses. Unstructured data is suitable for a deep learning model only after training and achieving a specific level of accuracy. Use Cases of Deep Learning The final highlight in a deep learning tutorial would obviously draw the limelight toward use cases of deep learning.

You can come across different types of machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, and deep learning libraries, such as Keras, Torch, and DL4J. The TensorFlow machine learning framework is an open-source library that simplifies implementation of machine learning models. Candidates seeking a career in AI and machine learning should learn about the fundamentals of TensorFlow and how it works. Let us learn about the working of TensorFlow and the important components in its architecture. Importance of TensorFlow The most notable questions on your mind right now must be \u2018What is TensorFlow\u2019 and about reasons for its popularity. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google to enable large-scale machine learning and analytics. Over the course of time, it evolved into a popular framework for deep learning applications and traditional machine learning applications. TensorFlow features a combination of multiple machine learning and deep learning models alongside algorithms, which can be implemented effectively with general programmatic metaphors.

Reasons to Use TensorFlow The introduction to TensorFlow AI framework provides a glimpse of its potential for transforming the definition of flexibility in machine learning development. TensorFlow uses inputs as multi-dimensional arrays with higher dimensions known as tensors. The multi-dimensional arrays serve an effective role in managing the massive volumes of data required for machine learning applications. TensorFlow also utilizes data flow graphs, featuring edges and nodes, for execution mechanism, thereby enabling easier execution of TensorFlow code. Here are some of the other reasons to use TensorFlow. Prior to the introduction of libraries such as TensorFlow, the coding mechanisms for machine learning applications involved multiple complications. The TensorFlow library offers a high-level API, which does not require complex coding for preparing neural networks, programming a neuron, or configuring a neuron. Apart from support for Python and C++, TensorFlow also supports integration with R and Java. One of the important things to remember about deep learning and machine learning is the need for extensive computation. The training process takes more time due to matrix multiplications, iterative processes, large data sizes, mathematical calculations, and other factors. Therefore, the training process of deep learning and machine learning models on CPUs takes much longer. Interestingly, Graphical Processing Units or GPUs have emerged as an efficient alternative to CPUs for developing ML and deep learning applications. As you try to learn TensorFlow fundamentals, you could come across its advantage of compatibility with CPUs and GPUs. Most important of all, it claims to have a faster compilation time than the competing deep learning libraries. Working of TensorFlow The most important element in an introduction to TensorFlow is the description of its working mechanism. TensorFlow helps in creating dataflow graphs, which provide a clear description of the movement of data through a graph. The graph features nodes as representations of mathematical operations. On the other hand, a connection between nodes is an edge, which is a multi-dimensional array. The capabilities of TensorFlow Machine Intelligence framework depend on the value advantages of the multi-dimensional array. Developers could create a flowchart of operations intended for the inputs in the multi-dimensional data array for efficient and faster processing. Let us uncover more layers in the working mechanism of TensorFlow in the following sections. High-Level Overview of Working Mechanisms of TensorFlow The architecture of TensorFlow involves three steps, such as data pre-processing, model development and training, and estimating the model. In the first step, data pre-processing involves structuring data and accumulating them in a specific limiting value. The next step involves development of the model. The final step involves training the model to use the data and estimating its efficiency by using unknown data. Another notable highlight of how TensorFlow works is the flexibility for running models trained with TensorFlow on desktop, mobile devices, and cloud as a web service. Furthermore, Google has also rolled out the custom TensorFlow Processing Unit or TPU for Google Cloud users to run TensorFlow. Components in Architecture of TensorFlow The components of TensorFlow make it one of the most powerful machine learning frameworks and describe the reasons for its different value advantages. Here is an overview of the different components which empower TensorFlow. As the name implies, Tensor is a core component in the architecture of TensorFlow. It is important to remember that TensorFlow uses tensors in all computations. Tensors are multi-dimensional matrices that represent multiple variants of data. On top of it, tensor could be the output of a computation, and in some cases, it could originate from input data. Graphs provide a description of all operations during the training process for ML and deep learning models. The operations are referred to as op nodes, and they are connected to each other. Graphs showcase the nodes alongside the connections between them without displaying values. Tensors and Graphs are the most vital requirements for the architecture of TensorFlow. If you want to learn TensorFlow and its uses, then you must familiarize yourself with the working of tensors and graphs in the framework. Here is a review of the working mechanisms of tensors and graphs. Working of Tensors Tensors are one of the common highlights in any TensorFlow tutorial for beginners. They are generalizations of matrices and vectors with significantly higher dimensions. Tensors are arrays of data featuring diverse ranks and dimensions, which are used as inputs for neural networks. In the case of deep learning models, you would come across large amounts of data in complicated formats. The complexity of processing data with such issues can be resolved with effective organization, usage, and storage with efficient use of resources. Some of the important terms for the working of tensors include dimension and ranks. Dimension refers to the size of elements in the array. On the other hand, ranks in tensors refer to the number of dimensions used for representing the data. For example, Rank 0 indicates that the array has only one element and is a scalar. Rank 1 indicates a one-dimensional array or vector, while Rank 2 implies a two-dimensional array or matrix. Once the array has achieved Rank 3, it becomes a tensor or a multi-dimensional array. Working of Data Flow Graphs The effectiveness of TensorFlow machine learning framework also depends on data flow graphs, which play a vital role in the computations of data in tensors. Interestingly, data flow graphs follow a different approach than traditional programming. Rather than executing code in a sequence, data flow graphs are created with nodes. Subsequently, you can execute the graphs with the help of a session. The process of creating a graph does not involve execution of the code. On the contrary, you must create a session for executing the graph. The working mechanism of data flow graphs sheds light on TensorFlow machine intelligence capabilities and their advantages. In the initial stages of developing a TensorFlow object, you would find a default graph. As you move towards advanced programming, you will find multiple graphs other than the default graph. TensorFlow also offers the facility of creating your custom graph. Upon execution of the graph, TensorFlow processes all the data provided as inputs. In addition, the execution process also takes external data through constants, variables, and placeholders. After creating the graph, you can enable execution on CPUs and GPUs or choose distributed programming approach for faster processing. TensorFlow enables programmers to create code for CPUs and GPUs, followed by executing them with a distributed approach. Programming in TensorFlow The explanation for how TensorFlow works emphasizes the importance of tensors and control flow graphs. On the other hand, you should also note that TensorFlow programs also rely on developing and executing computational graphs. Here is a brief overview of the two important steps in using TensorFlow. The process of creating a computational graph in TensorFlow involves coding. You can refer to any TensorFlow example to identify the difference between TensorFlow programming and traditional programming. Programmers with expertise in Python and machine learning programming with sci-kit-learn library could also find new concepts in TensorFlow programming. The general approaches for handling data inside the program are considerably different than the ones followed in conventional programming languages. For example, you would have to create a variable for everything which changes in the case of regular programming. On the contrary, TensorFlow enables data storage and manipulation through different programming elements, such as constants, placeholders, and variables. Constants represent the parameters that feature values that never change. You can define constants in TensorFlow with the \u2018tf.constant()\u2019 command. Variables are an important term you need to learn TensorFlow programming, which helps in adding new trainable parameters in the graph. You can define a variable with the \u2018tf.variable()\u2019 command. However, it is important to initialize the variable before running the graph. Placeholders are the next crucial element in TensorFlow programming as they help in feeding data to TensorFlow models from outside. Placeholders can also offer permissions for later allocation of value. You can define placeholders by using \u2018tf.placeholder()\u2019 command. The role of placeholders in TensorFlow AI framework as a special variable could be a new concept for beginners. However, you can use an example to understand their functionalities. For instance, you could have to load data from an image file or a local file during the computations for training process. Placeholders could serve a helpful role in such cases and help in obtaining the complete input without memory management complications. The most important highlight of TensorFlow machine learning framework is a session, which helps in executing TensorFlow code. Sessions help in evaluation of nodes and are also known as TensorFlow Runtime. During the creation of a session, you would execute a specific operation, node, or computation. TensorFlow allows the flexibility for classifying the assignment of variables or constants as operations. Sessions allow users to run all the nodes or operations. Final Words The review of TensorFlow and its capabilities showcase the valid reasons for its popularity. For example, TensorFlow machine intelligence can guarantee faster compilation time than competing deep learning libraries such as Keras and Torch. In addition, it also provides better usability with the help of simple front-end APIs compatible with C++, Python, R, and Java.

You can find more about the working mechanisms of ChatGPT by diving into the techniques which help it provide responses to search queries of users. The definition of ChatGPT explained how it uses a blend of Supervised Learning and Reinforced Learning for training the AI language model. Interestingly, it is also important to note that ChatGPT creators have also used a specific technique, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or RLHF. The mechanism utilizes human feedback within the training loop to reduce untruthful, biased, or harmful outputs. The RHLF methodology helps overcome different issues affecting language models such as GPT-3, the ChatGPT predecessor. Role of Capability and Alignment in Large Language Models You might be wondering about questions like \u201cWhat is capability?\u201d and \u201cWhat is alignment?\u201d in the case of large language models. The responses to \u201cWhat is ChatGPT used for?\u201d would involve carefully evaluating these components. A language model\u2019s capability defines the model\u2019s ability to perform one task or collection of tasks. Language models determine capability on the grounds of the ability to optimize the objective function, which is a mathematical expression dictating the goal of the language model. On the other hand, alignment in AI language models refers to the difference between the intended outcome and the actual outcome. It helps measure whether the AI model works according to the desired objectives. Large language models require training with massive volumes of data and skills for generating text, which is almost similar to human responses. However, the generated text can fall short in terms of accuracy, and the models cannot generate the text desired by human users. The objective function is one of the reasons for doubts such as \u201cIs ChatGPT a chatbot?\u201d as it works on generating predictions according to pre-trained data. On the contrary, the practical applications of ChatGPT and large language models focus on achieving some type of cognitive work with value. You can expect an AI model to come up with certain responses as a human, albeit without 100% accuracy. A mathematical model is less likely to choose the right text sequences for a specific situation or use common sense and background knowledge on particular topics. The mismatch between capacity and alignment leads to misalignment concerns which can affect large language models in different ways. First of all, misalignment creates a lack of compliance with the explicit instructions of a user. In addition, the AI language models do not provide an explanation of the ways in which the model achieved a specific prediction. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback The answers to \u201cWhat is ChatGPT and how does it work?\u201d can be summed up in one term, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or RLHF. You can find a technical explanation for the working of ChatGPT by understanding the details of the RLHF method. The Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or RLHF method includes three different steps, such as supervised fine-tuning, replication of human preferences, and Proximal Policy Optimization or PPO. It is important to remember that the first step of supervised fine-tuning for ChatGPT happens only once. Subsequently, the model can reiterate the steps for Proximal Policy Optimization and replication of human responses. Supervised fine-tuning is a pre-trained language model subjected to fine-tuning on the basis of small quantities of demonstration data. It is useful for offering training on a supervised policy for generating outputs from selected prompts. The supervised fine-tuning process in language models like ChatGPT refers to the baseline model. The second step in the working of ChatGPT would refer to the replication of human preferences. Developers must vote on different SFT model outputs, creating a new dataset with comparison data. The new dataset helps in the training of new models, and the second step qualifies as the reward model. Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO, is a comprehensive reward model which helps in fine-tuning and improving the SFT model. The PPO stage in working on large language models also helps in generating the policy model. The discussions about \u201cIs ChatGPT a chatbot?\u201d also draw attention to the PPO algorithm, which helps in training agents for reinforcement learning. It leverages the trust region optimization method for training the policy alongside leveraging a value function for estimating the expected outputs of a specific action. Evaluation of Performance of Large Language Models Another prominent highlight in the discussions about ChatGPT draws attention toward the performance of Large Language Models or LLMs. Once you have created the AI language model according to your parameters, you are likely worried about its performance. It is important to remember that input of human labellers helps in training the model. On the other hand, human input also forms a major portion of the evaluation strategy. The guide to ChatGPT explained for beginners would also account for important criteria used in the evaluation of performance for ChatGPT. The first important characteristic for testing the effectiveness of a ChatGPT application would point to helpfulness. Does the model understand and follow the user\u2019s instructions? The answer to this question can tell a lot about the ways in which the AI language model fulfils its tasks. The second important trait for evaluation of the performance of ChatGPT would point to harmlessness. Labellers can check whether the output of a model is appropriate or includes derogatory statements against one individual or a protected class. Another major highlight of evaluating the performance of ChatGPT is the truthfulness of responses. Does the model deliver truth and fact-based responses for specific tasks? The truthfulness of responses by ChatGPT can provide proof of the integrity of the language model. Use Cases of ChatGPT The technical aspects of working with ChatGPT provide a clear impression of how ChatGPT moves one step ahead of GPT-3.

AI can transform technology and its uses altogether by enabling machines with sentient capabilities like humans. For example, you must have heard discussions about AI taking the jobs of people in the coming years. Amidst the praises and criticisms for AI, prompt engineering or prompting has arrived as a disruptive concept in artificial intelligence uses. The most promising example of prompting, which has gained formidable traction in recent times, is ChatGPT. It takes text-based inputs and offers answers to the questions exactly like an expert in the concerned domain. As the use cases of prompting gain momentum, they are more likely to be embedded in the business landscape. The jargon in the domain of AI could create difficulties in understanding a prompt engineering tutorial and its significance. Beginners can have trouble navigating through AI jargon and other technical aspects related to prompting. The following post serves as a detailed introduction to prompting and the basics of a prompt. In addition, the post would also cover the important principles and pillars of prompting alongside its fundamental uses.  Definition of Prompt Engineering The first thing you would come across in discussions about prompting would reflect on its definition. At the same time, you must find answers to \u201cWhat is prompt engineering in AI?\u201d for a better understanding of the term. Prompting relies on using prompts to obtain required results from AI tools such as NLP services. You can have a prompt as a simple statement or a block of programming logic and even a string of words. The different methods for deploying prompts help in drawing unique responses. The working of prompting in AI is similar to prompting an individual to answer a question or start an essay. In the same way, you can utilize prompts for teaching AI models to provide desired results for specific tasks. For example, an AI model could take a specific prompt and create an essay on the basis of inputs, just like a human writer would achieve the task. The definition of prompt engineering from a technical perspective focuses on how it involves the design and development of prompts. The prompts serve as inputs for AI models and help in training the models to address specific tasks. Engineering of prompts emphasizes on the selection of appropriate data type alongside formatting, which helps the model in understanding and using the prompt for learning. Prompting focuses on the creation of high-quality training data, which can help the AI model in making accurate decisions and predictions. Examples of Prompt Engineering The fundamentals of prompting would be incomplete without examples. You can find popular prompt engineering examples in the cases of language models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3. The applications of multi-tasking prompting in 2021 with different NLP datasets delivered a good performance. Language models are capable of drawing reasoning representations with better accuracy through instances that rely on thought progression. Zero-shot learning has proved as an effective method for improving effectiveness of language models for addressing multi-step reasoning use cases. Other examples of prompt engineering gained dominance in 2022 with the launch of new machine-learning models. Some of the latest machine learning models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, have served as the foundations of text-to-image prompting. As the name implies, the new machine learning models can use prompting to convert text prompts into visuals. What are Prompts? The most common means of interaction between users and AI models is text or prompts. As a matter of fact, the answers to \u201cHow does prompt engineering work?\u201d could become more clear with an in-depth understanding of prompts. The basic definition of prompt paint it as a broad instruction you offer to the AI model. For example, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E need prompts in the form of detailed descriptions of desired visual output. On the other hand, prompts in the case of large language models or LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 could be simple queries. At the same time, LLMs could also rely on complex problems and instructions with multiple facts in the prompt. You can also use random statements such as \u201cTell me the description\u201d for a specific prompt. The most important highlight in prompt engineering examples would draw attention to the important components of a prompt. At the high level, you could identify four distinct components of a prompt, such as instructions, questions, input data, and examples. The successful design of prompts would depend on an effective combination of these elements of a prompt. Principles of Prompt Engineering The fundamental aspect of prompting, i.e., prompts, showcases the simplicity of training AI models to achieve desired tasks. Now, you must be curious about the methods for designing prompts. Here are the important principles which can guide the development of effective prompts for AI models. The fundamental highlight in a prompt engineering tutorial would emphasize guiding AI models for generating useful outputs. Imagine a scenario where you want a simmer of an article. In this case, you can use a prompt for training a large language model with sufficient data to obtain a summary. What would you include in the prompt for this example? The prompt would include the input text and the description of the task, i.e., how you want the summary. A detailed understanding of \u201cwhat is prompt engineering in AI?\u201d would also draw attention to the need for trying multiple prompt designs. Slight variations in the prompts could help in generating significantly different outputs. As a matter of fact, small changes in the design of the same prompt could generate multiple distinct outputs. AI models learn that different formulations of a prompt are applicable for different contexts and purposes. For example, the summarization task could not rely on simple prompts such as \u2018In summary.\u2019 On the other hand, variations such as \u201cThe main objective of the article is that\u201d or \u201cSummary of the article in plain language is.\u201d In addition, prompt engineering examples also point to the use of likelihood features. It can help in finding out whether the model has difficulties in understanding specific words, structures, or phrases. At the same time, you must also remember that the likelihood of prompts would be significantly higher in the initial stages of the sequence. The model could assign a low likelihood to a new prompt and familiarizes with it over multiple iterations of the model. The likelihood feature also helps prompt engineers to identify spelling or punctuation issues in the prompt. One of the basic things about defining tasks would point to the inclusion of additional components in task description. The applications of prompt engineering can generate desired results by providing adequate context to the model. In the case of the summarization use cases, you can provide a description of the task for summarization in detail. The critical components in prompts, such as input and output indicators, help in defining the desired task clearly to the model. A detailed description of prompt components could help in situations where you include multiple examples in a prompt. Examples are a crucial highlight in answers to \u201cHow does prompt engineering work?\u201d and serve as effective instruments for achieving desired output. The examples showcase the type of output you want from the model. You can leverage the few-shot learning model to offer specific examples of the types of output you want. Important Pillars of Prompt Engineering The next crucial aspect of a prompt engineering tutorial would draw attention to the important components of prompting. You can find five distinct components in the development of prompts, such as the following. The five pillars of prompting are important requirements for creating effective prompts which deliver desired results. Let us find out more about the implications of these pillars in the design of prompts. The foremost highlight of prompt engineering use cases would draw examples to the limelight. Examples are the representation of the output you expect from the model. How can GPT-3 achieve good results? The capability of GPT-3 for zero-shot learning help in obtaining answers without examples. On the other hand, adding examples to the equation could introduce radical improvements in response quality. However, it is important to practice caution while offering examples to AI models. For example, an excess of similar examples could reduce the creativity of the model in delivery outputs. On the contrary, the examples should serve as tools for fine-tuning AI models. The second aspect of the effective design of prompts refers to directions. While examples help in generating desired outputs, you have to provide directions to the AI model. Directions are an important highlight of \u201cHow does prompt engineering work?\u201d as they help in narrowing AI results. The use of directions for prompting AI models could help in obtaining the exact results you want from the model. Parameters are crucial for changing the type of answer generated by AI models. Majority of AI models feature a specific degree of flexibility. In the case of GPT-3, the most noticeable parameter is the \u201ctemperature,\u201d which denotes the degree of randomness in generating a response. Large language models in prompt engineering examples could select the next word that would fit in a sentence, albeit without any uniformity. With the help of \u2018temperature,\u2019 you can control the responses of the AI. For example, a higher temperature would ensure creative answers, while a lower temperature invokes generic responses. Open-source models such as GPT-J or custom and finetuned models are useful for setting parameters. As the name implies, the format in prompting defines how you want to receive the output. Experimental use of AI, such as asking questions to ChatGPT, does not emphasize the structure of answers by the model. On the contrary, the future of prompting would call for integrating AI into production tools, which need structured inputs. Without consistency in formatting the results, you are less likely to obtain productive outcomes from the model. The formatting of prompting outputs would depend significantly on the design of the prompt and the ending of the prompt. The final component in prompting is chaining, which helps in connecting multiple AI calls to complete the specified task. A review of responses to \u201cWhat is prompt engineering in AI?\u201d would showcase the importance of chaining. The limit on prompt length calls for breaking tasks into multiple prompts. One of the popular chaining tools is Langchain, which can help in stringing multiple actions together alongside ensuring the organization of prompts. Use Cases of Prompt Engineering The final highlight in a prompt engineering tutorial would point at the use cases of prompting. After learning the fundamentals of prompting, you must have doubts about the basic uses of prompts. Here are the top use cases of prompt engineering. The advanced uses of prompting include few-shot learning, zero-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting. You can also use prompting in large language models to incorporate information required for drawing accurate answers. Another advanced technique for prompting refers to self-consistency, which can sample different unique reasoning paths and use the responses for identifying consistent responses. Conclusion The detailed guide to prompt engineering provided insights into the fundamentals of prompts and their functionalities for AI models. Artificial Intelligence models are gradually expanding in terms of their use cases with futuristic applications. Prompts could help in guiding AI models just like instructions for a human to achieve specific tasks. The prompt engineering examples, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3, offer insights into how prompting can revolutionize AI. At the same time, it is also important to know about the recommended principles of prompting. The pillars of prompting outlined in the discussion also provide a comprehensive impression of how you can use prompting.

Both of these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the world. But the most discussed topic so far is that, whether these two can really be beneficial for each other. We already know that blockchain has the capability to offer a decentralized ledger system and many are already adopting the tech. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence also started to streamlining processes for our benefit. But can blockchain based AI be the next technological milestone? Well, let\u2019s see if blockchain is really capable of powering AI or not. Introduction to Blockchain + AI Infographic AI Blockchain \u2013 A Look Inside Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligent is the simulation of human-like intelligence through computer systems. Usually, these computer systems are programmed in a way to mimic human-like actions. Apparently, the process is utterly complex as human activities are complicated to simulate. But the primary ability of artificial intelligence would be to rationalize like humans and take actions based on intellectual thinking. They won\u2019t be only executing programs but would understand the concept behind it too. AI reaches this level of intelligence through deep learning methods. What is deep learning? Let\u2019s find out! Deep Learning: Pathway to Human Intelligence This new technique of learning is actually a form of machine learning. Here, the algorithm model is actually inspired by the human brain. So, here the machine will learn from a large amount of data. It\u2019s kind of similar to our learning method from experiences. In this method, the AI would perform any task repeatedly and see the outcome. Each time it will change the task slightly to improve the performance. Developers actually prefer this method over any typical machine learning. Deep learning can help AI\u2019s to learn how to think or perform tasks that require thinking beforehand. The process is actually very cool. AI as a Service (AIaaS) Artificial intelligence as a service refers to any AI services that come from a third-party view. Usually, if you want to make anything as a service, then it would need the ability to get called from a network that uses the cloud. That\u2019s why in many cases the software or technology will usually be available from a third-party vendor. You will be able to make certain changes and then utilize the features after that. Sometimes these products can be totally customized for your needs. This can be an excellent solution for those who can\u2019t afford to develop AI technology on their own or don\u2019t want to waste their resources for it. Developing an AI would require a lot of funding and then testing them out does require a lot of time. So, these companies then can utilize AI as a service to integrate the technology with theirs. Usually, this service offers: Currently, in 2018, the market value for AIaaS is over $1.52 Billion. However, experts believe the whole marketplace would grow to $10.88 billion by 2023. So, you see AIaaS would be one of the leading technology in the near future, so why not start investing in it? However, the development of AI still lacks in many ways. To deal with it, Blockchain can help out and together AI blockchain companies can be the fuel of the next generation of technology. What\u2019s the Current Landscape of AI? The problem is that any AI technology would grow when it can utilize a vast number of data. The more data it will get for learning, the better the output will be. However, this will require a lot of expensive resources, and clearly, small companies won\u2019t be able to keep up with it. Large companies have the lead now. They have the budget or resources for developing any training procedures needed for their AI\u2019s. Besides, they can also hire top experts to further assist in making new technology. As of today, big companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook holds the top positions. So, any new company that wants to play in the field need to at least top these powerful competitors. This situation is not that easy. The model would require a huge database, and most importantly it has been cost-effective. The second problem of today\u2019s AI technologies is that they are all centralized. All the companies hold of the information and protect their algorithms rather than making then open-source. Are Centralized AI Trustable? The use of a centralized database for teaching AI is highly questionable. Many experts are now assuming whether these technologies or entities can be trustable or not. Because AIs are supposed to be an unbiased source of information where it would be able to decide without a side. However, many of today\u2019s AI seems to be a little biased toward their developers. For example, let\u2019s assume that a company \u201cX\u201d created a new AI technology. However, whenever the AI is expected to make decisions for the greater good, it seems to go for the one that benefits the \u201cX\u201d company most. We already saw a lot of studies to prove this fact, and if this goes on then, we would never be able to achieve the ideal AI as we need. In a centralized field, the leading companies don\u2019t give us access to see how they are training their AI\u2019s, so we can\u2019t totally trust them. This is also raising a security threat. Algorithms are also being traded secretly, so one knows what exactly the AI is being trained for. You never know how an AI could affect the system and whether other competitions would pay for it or not. That\u2019s why to get rid of these flaws and to prevail fairness in the market AI blockchain companies can be the only solution. So, a decentralized network can really change the scenario, and with AI blockchain companies many can invest in AI. The Costs Are Too High AI tech is super fascinating and can open up a lot of doors for us. But after some time every company or individual who wants to pursue this tech realizes they need a massive amount of computational power to do so. And this is where the hardware specs come in. Building any technology with deep learning would require you to spend a lot of money. You\u2019ll have to deal with a lot of factors here. First comes the super-fast and powerful CPU, GPU, SSD, and powerful motherboard. It might not seem much at the start, but to build that much high tech you\u2019d have to get your hands on the best of the best hardware on the market. Needless to say, these aren\u2019t cheap. But AI tech isn\u2019t all about the hardware equipment. You\u2019d also have to consider the enormous power supply, maintenance and air-conditioning bills that will come along with it. Also, you\u2019d have to consider damage to components because not every equipment can take that much power load for too long. But that\u2019s not the worse part. Every technology keeps evolving as the time goes by. So, if you want to be on top of the competition, you\u2019d have to stay updated with the latest hardware specs. That\u2019s why AI technology becomes a really cost consuming industry of all time. In this regard, only high-end enterprises like Google or Facebook can think about continuing their AI project for a long time. But what will happen to small or medium-sized enterprises? Is there no way to cut the cost? Well, this is where Blockchain Technology comes into play. Blockchain can optimize the GPU for Better AI Services We all know AI\u2019s require a lot of computing powers. This is becoming an issue as computing powers are becoming a scarcity now. On the other hand, blockchain can utilize GPU usage differently. Outside of mining, these two does make a great coupling resource. If any developer can leverage this computing power, then they can make supercomputers really easily. Some companies also offer GPU as a service, but they are mostly centralized, so it doesn\u2019t help in the end. Google Cloud or Amazon does offer GPU services, but they are also centralized. So, in this case, many AI blockchain companies are trying to change the scene. They want to introduce the decentralized model and use blockchain together with AI. As blockchain already leverage the computing power of their users, this can really be cost efficient in the long run. We will be covering these companies shortly. As you can see, blockchain technology comes with a different nature of technology. The distributed ledger of this new tech can really help build a supercomputer at cheaper pricing. Introducing AI blockchain can cut costs up to 10 factors! With blockchain, you\u2019ll be able to solve all technical issues with great efficiency. So first, let\u2019s see how the convergence of blockchain and AI can help each other to reach the AI blockchain spectrum. Blockchains Role in AI Technology Now that you know how AI will influence the blockchain based AI tech, it\u2019s time to look into the blockchain role in this. Let\u2019s see how blockchain can improve AI and ensure a better AI blockchain solution for you. The AI technology suffers from a massive amount of unexplained data values. Why? Well, it\u2019s because mostly we can\u2019t always understand every AI\u2019s communication with us. AI\u2019s communicate or give output in values or data streams. Debugging those data streams takes up a lot of time, and many times the process becomes way too complex for us to understand and requires too much power. What AI blockchain can do here is to help you out to build a distributed supercomputer. Users on the network can lend their computing power, and by connecting them, it can become a supercomputer in no time. With the distributed nature you\u2019ll be able to track the machine learning process as every data in the blockchain gets added one after another. So, they would be able to come up with a clear route on how the AI is learning new information. The AI and blockchain together as a model would be capable of increasing the overall experience of AI. You would be able to get better solutions, better actions, more creative results, and cleverer artificial intelligence. Overlooking the network would help the AI learn faster than before, and therefore the development of AI would be much more streamlined. Not only blockchain would be able to connect all the marketplaces at once, but it will also give rise to new businesses. I mean, you can store all your information safely on the network, and I said before, you would be able to sell it too. This will starts a new marketplace for data. Storing information on the blockchain would also make the development of any AI decentralized. So, the secrecy of any AI operation would be removed, and anyone would be able to benefit from it. It will also give rise to AI marketplace where you will be able to get AI development tools from other companies who are selling it. This way the AI marketplace would be more fluid. So, the AI and blockchain together would be able to shine in every way. As you already know, centralized AI technologies can\u2019t be fully trusted. So, when everything would get stored in a decentralized database, you would get a clear trail of what the AI is doing and how it\u2019s communicating with other instances. It will rebuild your trust in AI, and you would be able to depend on it safely. Machine to machine interactions will also get recorded, and you will better understand their ways of communication. Thus, combining blockchain and AI, it would be able to break the barriers easily. With the AI blockchain user will be able to get the best AI experience of their lifetime. Blockchain already focuses on user experience and security more than anything. But when the blockchain fuels the AI, the possibilities of newer applications are huge. This new AI Blockchain technology can be used to build innovative smart applications that focuses mainly on users. Not only this but with blockchain on the mix, it will finally be a possibility to solve the silos of data issue. Notable Blockchain AI PAAS Vendors This company is unifying and building the supreme AI platform of all time. ATOZ is a distributed ledger technology that utilizes the power of AI. The primary target of ATOZ is to revolutionize the cloud computing industry and ensure a better technological output for the AI.

Launching any GPU-based Virtual Machine would take mere seconds, and you\u2019ll be able to work in parallel on different machines. The best part about ATOZ is that this company dedicates all their resources towards a cost-efficient solution. They know how the ecosystem of AI requires cost consuming hardware specs. For this many small to medium companies can\u2019t compete with the already established enterprises. With ATOZ you will be able to reduce the overall cost of deep learning by x5 factors! So, for your AI development needs, ATOZ can bring the whole package in one place. This is another organization who brought AI and Blockchain together in the same platform. They offer a DeepToken Exchange solution for developing any decentralized AI blockchain neural network applications. The main purpose of DeepBrain Chain is to provide a marketplace for the developers. Here, anyone would be able to access computing power needed for AIs. However, here everyone will get divided into categories based on their computing power. Miners will form the large nodes and can rent their computing power to companies. Much simpler computing hardware will be medium to small nodes. Any company then will be able to access it as they need. All the individuals renting the computational power will get DBC token as a payment. This token will be traded via the smart contract of NEO. Other than this, the network maintains all integrity using Delegated Proof of Stake and Proof of Importance. At present, DeepBrain chain wants to provide developers with cheap, low-cost computational power. But they want to expand it to more options such as a trading platform for AI algorithms, models, data, etc. Another decentralized marketplace for AI-based projects is SingularityNET. They are mostly for AI algorithms. Here vendors would be able to offer software and hardware services to the customers in exchange for cryptocurrency or any AI service. I think you already know how hard it can be to find relevant AI services on the market, not to mention their pricing. With SingularityNET you\u2019ll be able to utilize the decentralized platform and get your AI service as needed. Any developer who would add an AI service on the network would get paid via smart contracts and get paid in tokens. The matchmaking process of buying and selling facilities for smart contracts. It\u2019s a relatively simple marketplace where they wish to bring buyer and sellers in one place. At present, this company offers an AGI token, which is an ERC20 token. Everyone on the network mainly agents use this token to pay for the AI services. But these tokens also give agent voting rights on the network. This is a rather unique decentralized AI blockchain neural network platform. They are a decentralized network where they provide a computing power service. Anyone can be a part of the network whether they are an organization or an individual entity. The system is similar to Uber. If you have the computational power to spare you can sell it here to other organizations. The network is worldwide available, meaning anyone can use them and earn extra cash. Companies who are working with AI or blockchain would need a vast amount of computational power, which they can rent from here. Golem offers a wide range of processing power from the users; you\u2019ll be able to utilize the power from a personal computer to big data centers. That\u2019s why this platform can be the best example or AI blockchain as a whole. But how will the users renting their computational power get paid? It\u2019s simple. The blockchain network is based on Ethereum so that they can help settle any kind of payment along with providing computing resources. The networks token GNT is used for any kind of payment. If you want to buy some computational power, you\u2019ll need to request for it, and then you\u2019ll automatically set a smart contract. The smart contract will process the payment once you are done renting or buying the computational power. So, it\u2019s super easy. Cortex is a decentralized platform with Artificial Intelligence powers the network. Any AI developer would be able to upload their model, and other people can access those paying Cortex native tokens. They are open sourced and offer only AI models for now. Unlike other companies, they don\u2019t provide any kind of computational power for developing or training their AI. Any company that buys the model will get a machine learning AI application and would need to develop it further to their needs. Cortex is more suited for Artificial Intelligence decentralized applications. Another plus point is that this company will allow users to upload their decentralized AI applications and sell them on the network. This is another blockchain based platform that offers decentralized fog computing. Using SONM, you will be able to utilize computational power as a fog-like nature. Fog computing is actually different from cloud computing. The main difference is the decentralized nature. In typical cloud services, you\u2019ll get computational power form a centralized source or data centers. But in fog computing, you\u2019ll be able to get the same benefits but not only from one source. Instead, you\u2019ll be utilizing individual devices to get the service. This structure truly solves the scalability issue and makes the system distributed. Fog computing offers greater efficiency and performance compared to traditional cloud architecture. So, the main purpose of SONM is to create an open marketplace for computational resources. SONM uses ERC20 token \u2013 an Ethereum based token to settle the payments. The token SNM fuels the SONM network. In the marketplace, individuals are divided into groups \u2013 suppliers and customers. Suppliers will provide the computational power, and the customers will buy them. SONM uses Ethereum smart contract features to establish a contract between these two groups. This is another distributed computing network, but their main focus is on the enterprises. Tatau is blockchain based platform and uses AI to get ahold of the underutilized computational resources from the globe. The developers of Tatau thinks that the modern day CPU based data centers are not enough to promote innovative inventions of the future. These centers can\u2019t provide the needed backup for artificial intelligence, streaming analytics, and video rendering. That\u2019s why Tatau wants to resolve the issue by focusing on computational power that can take on the modern-day complex architecture. You\u2019ll be able to process services through their blockchain based network. Tatau designed their platform in a different way \u2013 process artificial intelligence, video rendering and leverage the GPU power. They also want to combine the GPU with sustainable energy sources for a wide range of industrial backup. So, large enterprises can use their platform to back up their higher computational technologies without any issues. To get ahold of the computational power, the buyer would have to buy TATAU token and then use that to pay the suppliers. Another great example of AI blockchain is iExec \u2013 a blockchain platform with a marketplace for computational power. iExec wants to create a new architecture for cloud computing. To work on the network, this company provides their own cryptocurrency called \u201cRLC.\u201d RLC stands for \u201cRuns on Lots of Computers\u201d which practically defines their whole scheme. The token is ERC20 token, so it\u2019s based on Ethereums blockchain platform. In the network, any user will get divided up into three major types \u2013 developer, provider, and token holder. Here, developers are the customers and will rent out computational power from the providers. The developers would have to pay the provider with the RLC token. On the other hand, the providers would be able to lease out their computational power to the developers and get paid in exchange. Token holders on the network would be able to use iExec\u2019s payment channel to send or receive money. But there\u2019s a bit of difference with other AI blockchain marketplaces. Here, the provider can become three types of different power renter \u2013 application, data, and server. On top of this, the developers will also be able to develop CLI and JS on the network. But to make sure that the system doesn\u2019t have any scalability issues every development is done off-chain on the decentralized cloud. Another fun fact is that developers can add their decentralized application to iExec\u2019s store to market their new inventions. So, you see this platform provides many opportunities for both developers and non-developers. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence and blockchain is two of the leading technologies so far. And so, AI Blockchain is simply the combination of Blockchain and AI. With this many hurdles on the pathway of AI evolution blockchain can definitely improve the scenario to a great extent. With blockchain, developers would be able to perform deep learning mechanism without worrying about the costing. AI blockchain can accelerate the development of supercomputers. With blockchain in the mix, innovations are surely on the way. AI blockchain can be the next generation pioneer in the tech world. It\u2019s hard to say, how they would actually turn out, but for now, let\u2019s hope for the best.  *Disclaimer: The article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide any investment advice.
